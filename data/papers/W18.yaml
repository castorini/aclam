  abstract: 'Automated scoring engines are usually trained and evaluated against human
    scores and compared to the benchmark of human-human agreement. In this paper we
    compare the performance of an automated speech scoring engine using two corpora:
    a corpus of almost 700,000 randomly sampled spoken responses with scores assigned
    by one or two raters during operational scoring, and a corpus of 16,500 exemplar
    responses with scores reviewed by multiple expert raters. We show that the choice
    of corpus used for model evaluation has a major effect on estimates of system
    performance with r varying between 0.64 and 0.80. Surprisingly, this is not the
    case for the choice of corpus for model training: when the training corpus is
    sufficiently large, the systems trained on different corpora showed almost identical
    performance when evaluated on the same corpus. We show that this effect is consistent
    across several learning algorithms. We conclude that evaluating the model on a
    corpus of exemplar responses if one is available provides additional evidence
    about system validity; at the same time, investing effort into creating a corpus
    of exemplar responses for model training is unlikely to lead to a substantial
    gain in model performance.'

  abstract: When interpreting questions in a virtual patient dialogue system one must
    inevitably tackle the challenge of a long tail of relatively infrequently asked
    questions. To make progress on this challenge, we investigate the use of paraphrasing
    for data augmentation and neural memory-based classification, finding that the
    two methods work best in combination. In particular, we find that the neural memory-based
    approach not only outperforms a straight CNN classifier on low frequency questions,
    but also takes better advantage of the augmented data created by paraphrasing,
    together yielding a nearly 10% absolute improvement in accuracy on the least frequently
    asked questions.

  abstract: We present the first work on predicting reading mistakes in children with
    reading difficulties based on eye-tracking data from real-world reading teaching.
    Our approach employs several linguistic and gaze-based features to inform an ensemble
    of different classifiers, including multi-task learning models that let us transfer
    knowledge about individual readers to attain better predictions. Notably, the
    data we use in this work stems from noisy readings in the wild, outside of controlled
    lab conditions. Our experiments show that despite the noise and despite the small
    fraction of misreadings, gaze data improves the performance more than any other
    feature group and our models achieve good performance. We further show that gaze
    patterns for misread words do not fully generalize across readers, but that we
    can transfer some knowledge between readers using multitask learning at least
    in some cases. Applications of our models include partial automation of reading
    assessment as well as personalized text simplification.

  abstract: 'Input material at the appropriate level is crucial for language acquisition.
    Automating the search for such material can systematically and efficiently support
    teachers in their pedagogical practice. This is the goal of the computational
    linguistic task of automatic input enrichment (Chinkina & Meurers, 2016): It analyzes
    and re-ranks a collection of texts in order to prioritize those containing target
    linguistic forms. In the online study described in the paper, we collected 240
    responses from English teachers in order to investigate whether they preferred
    automatic input enrichment over web search when selecting reading material for
    class. Participants demonstrated a general preference for the material provided
    by an automatic input enrichment system. It was also rated significantly higher
    than the texts retrieved by a standard web search engine with regard to the representation
    of linguistic forms and equivalent with regard to the relevance of the content
    to the topic. We discuss the implications of the results for language teaching
    and consider the potential strands of future research.'

  abstract: Evaluation of text difficulty is important both for downstream tasks like
    text simplification, and for supporting educators in classrooms. Existing work
    on automated text complexity analysis uses linear models with engineered knowledge-driven
    features as inputs. While this offers interpretability, these models have lower
    accuracy for shorter texts. Traditional readability metrics have the additional
    drawback of not generalizing to informational texts such as science. We propose
    a neural approach, training on science and other informational texts, to mitigate
    both problems. Our results show that neural methods outperform knowledge-based
    linear models for short texts, and have the capacity to generalize to genres not
    present in the training data.

  abstract: We present the task of second language acquisition (SLA) modeling. Given
    a history of errors made by learners of a second language, the task is to predict
    errors that they are likely to make at arbitrary points in the future. We describe
    a large corpus of more than 7M words produced by more than 6k learners of English,
    Spanish, and French using Duolingo, a popular online language-learning app. Then
    we report on the results of a shared task challenge aimed studying the SLA task
    via this corpus, which attracted 15 teams and synthesized work from various fields
    including cognitive science, linguistics, and machine learning.

  abstract: In this paper we present work-in-progress where we investigate the usefulness
    of previously created word lists to the task of single-word lexical complexity
    analysis and prediction of the complexity level for learners of Swedish as a second
    language. The word lists used map each word to a single CEFR level, and the task
    consists of predicting CEFR levels for unseen words. In contrast to previous work
    on word-level lexical complexity, we experiment with topics as additional features
    and show that linking words to topics significantly increases accuracy of classification.

  abstract: This paper presents COAST, a web-based application to easily and automatically
    enhance syllable structure, word stress, and spacing in texts, that was designed
    in close collaboration with learning therapists to ensure its practical relevance.
    Such syllable-enhanced texts are commonly used in learning therapy or private
    tuition to promote the recognition of syllables in order to improve reading and
    writing skills. In a state of the art solutions for automatic syllable enhancement,
    we put special emphasis on syllable stress and support specific marking of the
    primary syllable stress in words. Core features of our tool are i) a highly customizable
    text enhancement and template functionality, and ii) a novel crowd-sourcing mechanism
    that we employ to address the issue of data sparsity in language resources. We
    successfully tested COAST with real-life practitioners in a series of user tests
    validating the concept of our framework.

  abstract: Given that all users of a language can be creative in their language usage,
    the overarching goal of this work is to investigate issues of variability and
    acceptability in written text, for both non-native speakers (NNSs) and native
    speakers (NSs). We control for meaning by collecting a dataset of picture description
    task (PDT) responses from a number of NSs and NNSs, and we define and annotate
    a handful of features pertaining to form and meaning, to capture the multi-dimensional
    ways in which responses can vary and can be acceptable. By examining the decisions
    made in this corpus development, we highlight the questions facing anyone working
    with learner language properties like variability, acceptability and native-likeness.
    We find reliable inter-annotator agreement, though disagreements point to difficult
    areas for establishing a link between form and meaning.

  abstract: While dialog systems have been widely deployed for computer-assisted language
    learning (CALL) and formative assessment systems in recent years, relatively limited
    work has been done with respect to the psychometrics and validity of these technologies
    in evaluating and providing feedback regarding student learning and conversational
    ability. This paper formulates a Markov decision process based measurement model,
    and applies it to text chat data collected from crowdsourced native and non-native
    English language speakers interacting with an automated dialog agent. We investigate
    how well the model measures speaker conversational ability, and find that it effectively
    captures the differences in how native and non-native speakers of English accomplish
    the dialog task. Such models could have important implications for CALL systems
    of the future that effectively combine dialog management with measurement of learner
    conversational ability in real-time.

  abstract: While immediate feedback on learner language is often discussed in the
    Second Language Acquisition literature (e.g., Mackey 2006), few systems used in
    real-life educational settings provide helpful, metalinguistic feedback to learners.
    In this paper, we present a novel approach leveraging task information to generate
    the expected range of well-formed and ill-formed variability in learner answers
    along with the required diagnosis and feedback. We combine this offline generation
    approach with an online component that matches the actual student answers against
    the pre-computed hypotheses. The results obtained for a set of 33 thousand answers
    of 7th grade German high school students learning English show that the approach
    successfully covers frequent answer patterns. At the same time, paraphrases and
    content errors require a more flexible alignment approach, for which we are planning
    to complement the method with the CoMiC approach successfully used for the analysis
    of reading comprehension answers (Meurers et al., 2011).

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce NT2Lex, a novel lexical resource for Dutch
    as a foreign language (NT2) which includes frequency distributions of 17,743 words
    and expressions attested in expert-written textbook texts and readers graded along
    the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). In essence, the
    lexicon informs us about what kind of vocabulary should be understood when reading
    Dutch as a non-native reader at a particular proficiency level. The main novelty
    of the resource with respect to the previously developed CEFR-graded lexicons
    concerns the introduction of corpus-based evidence for L2 word sense complexity
    through the linkage to Open Dutch WordNet (Postma et al., 2016). The resource
    thus contains, on top of the lemmatised and part-of-speech tagged lexical entries,
    a total of 11,999 unique word senses and 8,934 distinct synsets.

    \ We propose a new neural approach to leverage the definition of each Chengyu\

  abstract: 'This paper presents the participation of the LaSTUS/TALN team in the
    Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task 2018 in the English monolingual
    track . The purpose of the task was to determine if a word in a given sentence
    can be judged as complex or not by a certain target audience. For the English
    track, task organizers provided a training and a development datasets of 27,299
    and 3,328 words respectively together with the sentence in which each word occurs.
    The words were judged as complex or not by 20 human evaluators; ten of whom are
    natives. We submitted two systems: one system modeled each word to evaluate as
    a numeric vector populated with a set of lexical, semantic and contextual features
    while the other system relies on a word embedding representation and a distance

  abstract: We approach the 2018 Shared Task on Complex Word Identification by leveraging
    a cross-lingual multitask learning approach. Our method is highly language agnostic,
    as evidenced by the ability of our system to generalize across languages, including
    languages for which we have no training data. In the shared task, this is the
    case for French, for which our system achieves the best performance. We further
    provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of which words pose problems for
    our system.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a kernel-based learning approach for the 2018
    Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task. Our approach is based on combining
    multiple low-level features, such as character n-grams, with high-level semantic
    features that are either automatically learned using word embeddings or extracted
    from a lexical knowledge base, namely WordNet. After feature extraction, we employ
    a kernel method for the learning phase. The feature matrix is first transformed
    into a normalized kernel matrix. For the binary classification task (simple versus
    complex), we employ Support Vector Machines. For the regression task, in which
    we have to predict the complexity level of a word (a word is more complex if it
    is labeled as complex by more annotators), we employ v-Support Vector Regression.
    We applied our approach only on the three English data sets containing documents
    from Wikipedia, WikiNews and News domains. Our best result during the competition
    was the third place on the English Wikipedia data set. However, in this paper,
    we also report better post-competition results.

  abstract: Psychological research on learning and memory has tended to emphasize
    small-scale laboratory studies. However, large datasets of people using educational
    software provide opportunities to explore these issues from a new perspective.
    In this paper we describe our approach to the Duolingo Second Language Acquisition
    Modeling (SLAM) competition which was run in early 2018. We used a well-known
    class of algorithms (gradient boosted decision trees), with features partially
    informed by theories from the psychological literature. After detailing our modeling
    approach and a number of supplementary simulations, we reflect on the degree to
    which psychological theory aided the model, and the potential for cognitive science
    and predictive modeling competitions to gain from each other.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore a variety of linguistic and cognitive features
    to better understand second language acquisition in early users of the language
    learning app Duolingo. With these features, we trained a random forest classifier
    to predict errors in early learners of French, Spanish, and English. Of particular
    note was our finding that mean and variance in error for each user and token can
    be a memory efficient replacement for their respective dummy-encoded categorical
    variables. At test, these models improved over the baseline model with AUROC values
    of 0.803 for English, 0.823 for French, and 0.829 for Spanish.

  abstract: Studies of writing revisions rarely focus on revision quality. To address
    this issue, we introduce a corpus of between-draft revisions of student argumentative
    essays, annotated as to whether each revision improves essay quality. We demonstrate
    a potential usage of our annotations by developing a machine learning model to
    predict revision improvement. With the goal of expanding training data, we also
    extract revisions from a dataset edited by expert proofreaders. Our results indicate
    that blending expert and non-expert revisions increases model performance, with
    expert data particularly important for predicting low-quality revisions.

  abstract: "Since the end of the CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error correction\
    \ (GEC), research into language model (LM) based approaches to GEC has largely\
    \ stagnated. In this paper, we re-examine LMs in GEC and show that it is entirely\
    \ possible to build a simple system that not only requires minimal annotated data\
    \ (\u223C1000 sentences), but is also fairly competitive with several state-of-the-art\
    \ systems. This approach should be of particular interest for languages where\
    \ very little annotated training data exists, although we also hope to use it\
    \ as a baseline to motivate future research."

  abstract: We present a novel rule-based system for automatic generation of factual
    questions from sentences, using semantic role labeling (SRL) as the main form
    of text analysis. The system is capable of generating both wh-questions and yes/no
    questions from the same semantic analysis. We present an extensive evaluation
    of the system and compare it to a recent neural network architecture for question
    generation. The SRL-based system outperforms the neural system in both average
    quality and variety of generated questions.

  abstract: "Technology is transforming Higher Education learning and teaching. This\
    \ paper reports on a project to examine how and why automated content analysis\
    \ could be used to assess precis writing by university students. We examine the\
    \ case of one hundred and twenty-two summaries written by computer science freshmen.\
    \ The texts, which had been hand scored using a teacher-designed rubric, were\
    \ autoscored using the Natural Language Processing software, PyrEval. Pearson\u2019\
    s correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation were used to analyze the\
    \ relationship between the teacher score and the PyrEval score for each summary.\
    \ Three content models automatically constructed by PyrEval from different sets\
    \ of human reference summaries led to consistent correlations, showing that the\
    \ approach is reliable. Also observed was that, in cases where the focus of student\
    \ assessment centers on formative feedback, categorizing the PyrEval scores by\
    \ examining the average and standard deviations could lead to novel interpretations\
    \ of their relationships. It is suggested that this project has implications for\
    \ the ways in which automated content analysis could be used to help university\
    \ students improve their summarization skills."

  abstract: There has been an increase in popularity of data-driven question answering
    systems given their recent success. This pa-per explores the possibility of building
    a tutorial question answering system for Java programming from data sampled from
    a community-based question answering forum. This paper reports on the creation
    of a dataset that could support building such a tutorial question answering system
    and discusses the methodology to create the 106,386 question strong dataset. We
    investigate how retrieval-based and generative models perform on the given dataset.
    The work also investigates the usefulness of using hybrid approaches such as combining
    retrieval-based and generative models. The results indicate that building data-driven
    tutorial systems using community-based question answering forums holds significant
    promise.

  abstract: We investigate how machine learning models, specifically ranking models,
    can be used to select useful distractors for multiple choice questions. Our proposed
    models can learn to select distractors that resemble those in actual exam questions,
    which is different from most existing unsupervised ontology-based and similarity-based
    methods. We empirically study feature-based and neural net (NN) based ranking
    models with experiments on the recently released SciQ dataset and our MCQL dataset.
    Experimental results show that feature-based ensemble learning methods (random
    forest and LambdaMART) outperform both the NN-based method and unsupervised baselines.
    These two datasets can also be used as benchmarks for distractor generation.

  abstract: Some language exams have multiple writing tasks. When a learner writes
    multiple texts in a language exam, it is not surprising that the quality of these
    texts tends to be similar, and the existing automated text scoring (ATS) systems
    do not explicitly model this similarity. In this paper, we suggest that it could
    be useful to include the other texts written by this learner in the same exam
    as extra references in an ATS system. We propose various approaches of fusing
    information from multiple tasks and pass this authorship knowledge into our ATS
    model on six different datasets. We show that this can positively affect the model
    performance at a global level.

    Word Identification (CWI) 2018 (Yimam et al., 2018), hosted by the 13th Workshop
    on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA) at NAACL
    2018. Our system for English builds on previous work for Swedish concerning the
    classification of words into proficiency levels. We investigate different features
    for English and compare their usefulness using feature selection methods. For
    the German, Spanish and French data we use simple systems based on character n-gram
    models and show that sometimes simple models achieve comparable results to fully
    feature-engineered systems.

    on the English test set. We demonstrated the flexibility of the deep-learning
    approach by using the same deep neural network setup in the Spanish track. Our
    systems achieved competitive results: all our systems were within 0.01 of the

  abstract: We describe a system for the CWI-task that includes information on 5 aspects
    of the (complex) lexical item, namely distributional information of the item itself,
    morphological structure, psychological measures, corpus-counts and topical information.
    We constructed a deep learning architecture that combines those features and apply
    it to the probabilistic and binary classification task for all English sets and
    Spanish. We achieved reasonable performance on all sets with best performances
    seen on the probabilistic task, particularly on the English news set (MAE 0.054
    and F1-score of 0.872). An analysis of the results shows that reasonable performance
    can be achieved with a single architecture without any domain-specific tweaking
    of the parameter settings and that distributional features capture almost all
    of the information also found in hand-crafted features.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the results of NILC team at CWI 2018. We developed
    solutions following three approaches: (i) a feature engineering method using lexical,
    n-gram and psycholinguistic features, (ii) a shallow neural network method using
    only word embeddings, and (iii) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) language model,
    which is pre-trained on a large text corpus to produce a contextualized word vector.
    The feature engineering method obtained our best results for the classification
    task and the LSTM model achieved the best results for the probabilistic classification
    task. Our results show that deep neural networks are able to perform as well as
    traditional machine learning methods using manually engineered features for the
    task of complex word identification in English.'

  abstract: This paper investigates the use of character n-gram frequencies for identifying
    complex words in English, German and Spanish texts. The approach is based on the
    assumption that complex words are likely to contain different character sequences
    than simple words. The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was used with n-grams
    of different lengths as features, and the best results were obtained for the combination
    of 2-grams and 4-grams. This variant was submitted to the Complex Word Identification
    Shared Task 2018 for all texts and achieved F-scores between 70% and 83%. The
    system was ranked in the middle range for all English texts, as third of fourteen
    submissions for German, and as tenth of seventeen submissions for Spanish. The
    method is not very convenient for the cross-language task, achieving only 59%
    on the French text.

  abstract: This paper describes the system developed by the Centre for English Corpus
    Linguistics for the 2018 Duolingo SLAM challenge. It aimed at predicting the successes
    and mistakes of second language learners on each of the words that compose the
    exercises they answered. Its main characteristic is to include conjunctive features,
    built by combining word ngrams with metadata about the user and the exercise.
    It achieved a relatively good performance, ranking fifth out of 15 systems. Complementary
    analyses carried out to gauge the contribution of the different sets of features
    to the performance confirmed the usefulness of the conjunctive features for the
    SLAM task.

  abstract: Second Language Acquisition Modeling is the task to predict whether a
    second language learner would respond correctly in future exercises based on their
    learning history. In this paper, we propose a neural network based system to utilize
    rich contextual, linguistic and user information. Our neural model consists of
    a Context encoder, a Linguistic feature encoder, a User information encoder and
    a Format information encoder (CLUF). Furthermore, a decoder is introduced to combine
    such encoded features and make final predictions. Our system ranked in first place
    in the English track and second place in the Spanish and French track with an
    AUROC score of 0.861, 0.835 and 0.854 respectively.

  abstract: "Developing plausible distractors (wrong answer options) when writing\
    \ multiple-choice questions has been described as one of the most challenging\
    \ and time-consuming parts of the item-writing process. In this paper we propose\
    \ a fully automatic method for generating distractor suggestions for multiple-choice\
    \ questions used in high-stakes medical exams. The system uses a question stem\
    \ and the correct answer as an input and produces a list of suggested distractors\
    \ ranked based on their similarity to the stem and the correct answer. To do this\
    \ we use a novel approach of combining concept embeddings with information retrieval\
    \ methods. We frame the evaluation as a prediction task where we aim to \u201C\
    predict\u201D the human-produced distractors used in large sets of medical questions,\
    \ i.e. if a distractor generated by our system is good enough it is likely to\
    \ feature among the list of distractors produced by the human item-writers. The\
    \ results reveal that combining concept embeddings with information retrieval\
    \ approaches significantly improves the generation of plausible distractors and\
    \ enables us to match around 1 in 5 of the human-produced distractors. The approach\
    \ proposed in this paper is generalisable to all scenarios where the distractors\
    \ refer to concepts."

  abstract: This paper presents an investigation of using a co-attention based neural
    network for source-dependent essay scoring. We use a co-attention mechanism to
    help the model learn the importance of each part of the essay more accurately.
    Also, this paper shows that the co-attention based neural network model provides
    reliable score prediction of source-dependent responses. We evaluate our model
    on two source-dependent response corpora. Results show that our model outperforms
    the baseline on both corpora. We also show that the attention of the model is
    similar to the expert opinions with examples.

  abstract: We investigate the feasibility of cross-lingual content scoring, a scenario
    where training and test data in an automatic scoring task are from two different
    languages. Cross-lingual scoring can contribute to educational equality by allowing
    answers in multiple languages. Training a model in one language and applying it
    to another language might also help to overcome data sparsity issues by re-using
    trained models from other languages. As there is no suitable dataset available
    for this new task, we create a comparable bi-lingual corpus by extending the English
    ASAP dataset with German answers. Our experiments with cross-lingual scoring based
    on machine-translating either training or test data show a considerable drop in
    scoring quality.

  abstract: Computational models to detect mental illnesses from text and speech could
    enhance our understanding of mental health while offering opportunities for early
    detection and intervention. However, these models are often disconnected from
    the lived experience of depression and the larger diagnostic debates in mental
    health. This article investigates these disconnects, primarily focusing on the
    labels used to diagnose depression, how these labels are computationally represented,
    and the performance metrics used to evaluate computational models. We also consider
    how medical instruments used to measure depression, such as the Patient Health
    Questionnaire (PHQ), contribute to these disconnects. To illustrate our points,
    we incorporate mixed-methods analyses of 698 interviews on emotional health, which
    are coupled with self-report PHQ screens for depression. We propose possible strategies
    to bridge these gaps between modern psychiatric understandings of depression,
    lay experience of depression, and computational representation.

  abstract: Automated depression detection is inherently a multimodal problem. Therefore,
    it is critical that researchers investigate fusion techniques for multimodal design.
    This paper presents the first-ever comprehensive study of fusion techniques for
    depression detection. In addition, we present novel linguistically-motivated fusion
    techniques, which we find outperform existing approaches.

  abstract: We report on the creation of a dataset for studying assessment of suicide
    risk via online postings in Reddit. Evaluation of risk-level annotations by experts
    yields what is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of reliability in risk
    assessment by clinicians based on social media postings. We also introduce and
    demonstrate the value of a new, detailed rubric for assessing suicide risk, compare
    crowdsourced with expert performance, and present baseline predictive modeling
    experiments using the new dataset, which will be made available to researchers
    through the American Association of Suicidology.

  abstract: "We describe the shared task for the CLPsych 2018 workshop, which focused\
    \ on predicting current and future psychological health from an essay authored\
    \ in childhood. Language-based predictions of a person\u2019s current health have\
    \ the potential to supplement traditional psychological assessment such as questionnaires,\
    \ improving intake risk measurement and monitoring. Predictions of future psychological\
    \ health can aid with both early detection and the development of preventative\
    \ care. Research into the mental health trajectory of people, beginning from their\
    \ childhood, has thus far been an area of little work within the NLP community.\
    \ This shared task represents one of the first attempts to evaluate the use of\
    \ early language to predict future health; this has the potential to support a\
    \ wide variety of clinical health care tasks, from early assessment of lifetime\
    \ risk for mental health problems, to optimal timing for targeted interventions\
    \ aimed at both prevention and treatment."

  abstract: The Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2018 Shared
    Task asked teams to predict cross-sectional indices of anxiety and distress, and
    longitudinal indices of psychological distress from a subsample of the National
    Child Development Study, started in the United Kingdom in 1958. Teams aimed to
    predict mental health outcomes from essays written by 11-year-olds about what
    they believed their lives would be like at age 25. In the hopes of producing results
    that could be easily disseminated and applied, we used largely theory-based dictionaries
    to process the texts, and a simple data-driven approach to model selection. This
    approach yielded only modest results in terms of out-of-sample accuracy, but most
    of the category-level findings are interpretable and consistent with existing
    literature on psychological distress, anxiety, and depression.

  abstract: "Mental health forums are online spaces where people can share their experiences\
    \ anonymously and get peer support. These forums, require the supervision of moderators\
    \ to provide support in delicate cases, such as posts expressing suicide ideation.\
    \ The large increase in the number of forum users makes the task of the moderators\
    \ unmanageable without the help of automatic triage systems. In the present paper,\
    \ we present a Machine Learning approach for the triage of posts. Most approaches\
    \ in the literature focus on the content of the posts, but only a few authors\
    \ take advantage of features extracted from the context in which they appear.\
    \ Our approach consists of the development and implementation of a large variety\
    \ of new features from both, the content and the context of posts, such as previous\
    \ messages, interaction with other users and author\u2019s history. Our method\
    \ has competed in the CLPsych 2017 Shared Task, obtaining the first place for\
    \ several of the subtasks. Moreover, we also found that models that take advantage\
    \ of post context improve significantly its performance in the detection of flagged\
    \ posts (posts that require moderators attention), as well as those that focus\
    \ on post content outperforms in the detection of most urgent events."

  abstract: Mental health problems represent a major public health challenge. Automated
    analysis of text related to mental health is aimed to help medical decision-making,
    public health policies and to improve health care. Such analysis may involve text
    classification. Traditionally, automated classification has been performed mainly
    using machine learning methods involving costly feature engineering. Recently,
    the performance of those methods has been dramatically improved by neural methods.
    However, mainly Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been explored. In this
    paper, we apply a hierarchical Recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with
    an attention mechanism on social media data related to mental health. We show
    that this architecture improves overall classification results as compared to
    previously reported results on the same data. Benefitting from the attention mechanism,
    it can also efficiently select text elements crucial for classification decisions,
    which can also be used for in-depth analysis.

  abstract: Depression is a global mental health condition that affects all cultures.
    Despite this, the way depression is expressed varies by culture. Uptake of machine
    learning technology for diagnosing mental health conditions means that increasingly
    more depression classifiers are created from online language data. Yet, culture
    is rarely considered as a factor affecting online language in this literature.
    This study explores cultural differences in online language data of users with
    depression. Written language data from 1,593 users with self-reported depression
    from the online peer support community 7 Cups of Tea was analyzed using the Linguistic
    Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), topic modeling, data visualization, and other techniques.
    We compared the language of users identifying as White, Black or African American,
    Hispanic or Latino, and Asian or Pacific Islander. Exploratory analyses revealed
    cross-cultural differences in depression expression in online language data, particularly
    in relation to emotion expression, cognition, and functioning. The results have
    important implications for avoiding depression misclassification from machine-driven
    assessments when used in a clinical setting, and for avoiding inadvertent cultural
    biases in this line of research more broadly.

  abstract: "Mental illness detection in social media can be considered a complex\
    \ task, mainly due to the complicated nature of mental disorders. In recent years,\
    \ this research area has started to evolve with the continuous increase in popularity\
    \ of social media platforms that became an integral part of people\u2019s life.\
    \ This close relationship between social media platforms and their users has made\
    \ these platforms to reflect the users\u2019 personal life with different limitations.\
    \ In such an environment, researchers are presented with a wealth of information\
    \ regarding one\u2019s life. In addition to the level of complexity in identifying\
    \ mental illnesses through social media platforms, adopting supervised machine\
    \ learning approaches such as deep neural networks have not been widely accepted\
    \ due to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of annotated training\
    \ data. Due to these reasons, we try to identify the most effective deep neural\
    \ network architecture among a few of selected architectures that were successfully\
    \ used in natural language processing tasks. The chosen architectures are used\
    \ to detect users with signs of mental illnesses (depression in our case) given\

  abstract: This paper describes the systems we developed for tasks A and B of the
    2018 CLPsych shared task. The first task (task A) focuses on predicting behavioral
    health scores at age 11 using childhood essays. The second task (task B) asks
    participants to predict future psychological distress at ages 23, 33, 42, and
    50 using the age 11 essays. We propose two convolutional neural network based
    methods that map each task to a regression problem. Among seven teams we ranked
    third on task A with disattenuated Pearson correlation (DPC) score of 0.5587.
    Likewise, we ranked third on task B with an average DPC score of 0.3062.

  abstract: This paper describes our approach to the CLPsych 2018 Shared Task, in
    which we attempted to predict cross-sectional psychological health at age 11 and
    future psychological distress based on childhood essays. We attempted several
    modeling approaches and observed best cross-validated prediction accuracy with
    relatively simple models based on psychological theory. The models provided reasonable
    predictions in most outcomes. Notably, our model was especially successful in
    predicting out-of-sample psychological distress (across people and across time)
    at age 50.

  abstract: This paper describes the IDLab system submitted to Task A of the CLPsych
    2018 shared task. The goal of this task is predicting psychological health of
    children based on language used in hand-written essays and socio-demographic control
    variables. Our entry uses word- and character-based features as well as lexicon-based
    features and features derived from the essays such as the quality of the language.
    We apply linear models, gradient boosting as well as neural-network based regressors
    (feed-forward, CNNs and RNNs) to predict scores. We then make ensembles of our
    best performing models using a weighted average.

  abstract: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder which afflicts an estimated 0.7% of
    adults world wide. It affects many areas of mental function, often evident from
    incoherent speech. Diagnosing schizophrenia relies on subjective judgments resulting
    in disagreements even among trained clinicians. Recent studies have proposed the
    use of natural language processing for diagnosis by drawing on automatically-extracted
    linguistic features like discourse coherence and lexicon. Here, we present the
    first benchmark comparison of previously proposed coherence models for detecting
    symptoms of schizophrenia and evaluate their performance on a new dataset of recorded
    interviews between subjects and clinicians. We also present two alternative coherence
    metrics based on modern sentence embedding techniques that outperform the previous
    methods on our dataset. Lastly, we propose a novel computational model for reference
    incoherence based on ambiguous pronoun usage and show that it is a highly predictive
    feature on our data. While the number of subjects is limited in this pilot study,
    our results suggest new directions for diagnosing common symptoms of schizophrenia.

  abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized
    by impaired social communication and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns
    of behaviors and interests. Prior research suggests that restricted patterns of
    behavior in ASD may be cross-domain phenomena that are evident in a variety of
    modalities. Computational studies of language in ASD provide support for the existence
    of an underlying dimension of restriction that emerges during a conversation.
    Similar evidence exists for restricted patterns of facial movement. Using tools
    from computational linguistics, computer vision, and information theory, this
    study tests whether cognitive-motor restriction can be detected across multiple
    behavioral domains in adults with ASD during a naturalistic conversation. Our
    methods identify restricted behavioral patterns, as measured by entropy in word
    use and mouth movement. Results suggest that adults with ASD produce significantly
    less diverse mouth movements and words than neurotypical adults, with an increased
    reliance on repeated patterns in both domains. The diversity values of the two
    domains are not significantly correlated, suggesting that they provide complementary
    information.

  abstract: Over 800000 people die of suicide each year. It is es-timated that by
    the year 2020, this figure will have in-creased to 1.5 million. It is considered
    to be one of the major causes of mortality during adolescence. Thus there is a
    growing need for methods of identifying su-icidal individuals. Language analysis
    is known to be a valuable psychodiagnostic tool, however the material for such
    an analysis is not easy to obtain. Currently as the Internet communications are
    developing, there is an opportunity to study texts of suicidal individuals. Such
    an analysis can provide a useful insight into the peculiarities of suicidal thinking,
    which can be used to further develop methods for diagnosing the risk of suicidal
    behavior. The paper analyzes the dynamics of a number of linguistic parameters
    of an idiostyle of a Russian-language blogger who died by suicide. For the first
    time such an analysis has been conducted using the material of Russian online
    texts. For text processing, the LIWC program is used. A correlation analysis was
    performed to identify the relationship between LIWC variables and number of days
    prior to suicide. Data visualization, as well as comparison with the results of
    related studies was performed.

  abstract: "Self-reported diagnosis statements have been widely employed in studying\
    \ language related to mental health in social media. However, existing research\
    \ has largely ignored the temporality of mental health diagnoses. In this work,\
    \ we introduce RSDD-Time: a new dataset of 598 manually annotated self-reported\
    \ depression diagnosis posts from Reddit that include temporal information about\
    \ the diagnosis. Annotations include whether a mental health condition is present\
    \ and how recently the diagnosis happened. Furthermore, we include exact temporal\
    \ spans that relate to the date of diagnosis. This information is valuable for\
    \ various computational methods to examine mental health through social media\
    \ because one\u2019s mental health state is not static. We also test several baseline\
    \ classification and extraction approaches, which suggest that extracting temporal\
    \ information from self-reported diagnosis statements is challenging."

    \ such as mental health and likelihood to cooperate with others such as clinicians.\
    \ While data-driven measures of interpersonal trust have previously been introduced,\

    \ a longer questionnaire can yield greater test set accuracy, while, for training,\
    \ we find it beneficial to include users who took smaller questionnaires which\
    \ offers more observations for training. Similarly, after noting a decrease in\

  abstract: In recent years, online communities have formed around suicide and self-harm
    prevention. While these communities offer support in moment of crisis, they can
    also normalize harmful behavior, discourage professional treatment, and instigate
    suicidal ideation. In this work, we focus on how interaction with others in such
    a community affects the mental state of users who are seeking support. We first
    build a dataset of conversation threads between users in a distressed state and
    community members offering support. We then show how to construct a classifier
    to predict whether distressed users are helped or harmed by the interactions in
    the thread, and we achieve a macro-F1 score of up to 0.69.

  abstract: We present a corpus study of pronominal anaphora on Twitter conversations.
    After outlining the specific features of this genre, with respect to reference
    resolution, we explain the construction of our corpus and the annotation steps.
    From this we derive a list of phenomena that need to be considered when performing
    anaphora resolution on this type of data. Finally, we test the performance of
    an off-the-shelf resolution system, and provide some qualitative error analysis.

  abstract: "The ARRAU corpus is an anaphorically annotated corpus of English providing\
    \ rich linguistic information about anaphora resolution. The most distinctive\
    \ feature of the corpus is the annotation of a wide range of anaphoric relations,\
    \ including bridging references and discourse deixis in addition to identity (coreference).\
    \ Other distinctive features include treating all NPs as markables, including\
    \ non-referring NPs; and the annotation of a variety of morphosyntactic and semantic\
    \ mention and entity attributes, including the genericity status of the entities\
    \ referred to by markables. The corpus however has not been extensively used for\
    \ anaphora resolution research so far. In this paper, we discuss three datasets\
    \ extracted from the ARRAU corpus to support the three subtasks of the CRAC 2018\
    \ Shared Task\u2013identity anaphora resolution over ARRAU-style markables, bridging\
    \ references resolution, and discourse deixis; the evaluation scripts assessing\
    \ system performance on those datasets; and preliminary results on these three\
    \ tasks that may serve as baseline for subsequent research in these phenomena."

  abstract: 'We present two systems for bridging resolution, which we submitted to
    the CRAC shared task on bridging anaphora resolution in the ARRAU corpus (track
    2): a rule-based approach following Hou et al. 2014 and a learning-based approach.
    The re-implementation of Hou et al. 2014 achieves very poor performance when being
    applied to ARRAU. We found that the reasons for this lie in the different bridging
    annotations: whereas the rule-based system suggests many referential bridging
    pairs, ARRAU contains mostly lexical bridging. We describe the differences between
    these two types of bridging and adapt the rule-based approach to be able to handle
    lexical bridging. The modified rule-based approach achieves reasonable performance
    on all (sub)-tasks and outperforms a simple learning-based approach.'

  abstract: "Notional anaphors are pronouns which disagree with their antecedents\u2019\
    \ grammatical categories for notional reasons, such as plural to singular agreement\
    \ in: \u201Cthe government ... they\u201D. Since such cases are rare and conflict\
    \ with evidence from strictly agreeing cases (\u201Cthe government ... it\u201D\
    ), they present a substantial challenge to both coreference resolution and referring\
    \ expression generation. Using the OntoNotes corpus, this paper takes an ensemble\
    \ approach to predicting English notional anaphora in context on the basis of\
    \ the largest empirical data to date. In addition to state of the art prediction\
    \ accuracy, the results suggest that theoretical approaches positing a plural\
    \ construal at the antecedent\u2019s utterance are insufficient, and that circumstances\
    \ at the anaphor\u2019s utterance location, as well as global factors such as\
    \ genre, have a strong effect on the choice of referring expression."

  abstract: Bridging resolution is the task of recognising bridging anaphors and linking
    them to their antecedents. While there is some work on bridging resolution for
    English, there is only little work for German. We present two datasets which contain
    bridging annotations, namely DIRNDL and GRAIN, and compare the performance of
    a rule-based system with a simple baseline approach on these two corpora. The
    performance for full bridging resolution ranges between an F1 score of 13.6% for
    DIRNDL and 11.8% for GRAIN. An analysis using oracle lists suggests that the system
    could, to a certain extent, benefit from ranking and re-ranking antecedent candidates.
    Furthermore, we investigate the importance of single features and show that the
    features used in our work seem promising for future bridging resolution approaches.

  abstract: This paper describes the design and evaluation of a system for the automatic
    detection and resolution of shell nouns in German. Shell nouns are general nouns,
    such as fact, question, or problem, whose full interpretation relies on a content
    phrase located elsewhere in a text, which these nouns simultaneously serve to
    characterize and encapsulate. To accomplish this, the system uses a series of
    lexico-syntactic patterns in order to extract shell noun candidates and their
    content in parallel. Each pattern has its own classifier, which makes the final
    decision as to whether or not a link is to be established and the shell noun resolved.
    Overall, about 26.2% of the annotated shell noun instances were correctly identified
    by the system, and of these cases, about 72.5% are assigned the correct content
    phrase. Though it remains difficult to identify shell noun instances reliably
    (recall is accordingly low in this regard), this system usually assigns the right
    content to correctly classified cases. cases.

  abstract: We present PAWS, a multi-lingual parallel treebank with coreference annotation.
    It consists of English texts from the Wall Street Journal translated into Czech,
    Russian and Polish. In addition, the texts are syntactically parsed and word-aligned.
    PAWS is based on PCEDT 2.0 and continues the tradition of multilingual treebanks
    with coreference annotation. The paper focuses on the coreference annotation in
    PAWS and its language-specific differences. PAWS offers linguistic material that
    can be further leveraged in cross-lingual studies, especially on coreference.

    on (i) the impact of the form of referring expression on entity-vs-event preferences

    story-continuation experiments were conducted, using constructed and naturally-occurring
    passages, to see how participants interpret It and This pronouns following a context
    sentence that makes available event and entity referents. Our participants show
    a strong, but not categorical, bias to use This to refer to events and It to refer
    to entities. However, these preferences vary with passage characteristics such
    as verb class (a proxy in our constructed examples for the number of explicit
    and implicit entities) and more subtle author intentions regarding subsequent
    re-mention (the original event-vs-entity re-mention of our corpus items).

  abstract: "In this position paper, we propose that the community consider encouraging\
    \ researchers to include two riders, a \u201CLay Summary\u201D and an \u201CAI\
    \ Safety Disclosure\u201D, as part of future NLP papers published in ACL forums\
    \ that present user-facing systems. The goal is to encourage researchers\u2013\
    via a relatively non-intrusive mechanism\u2013to consider the societal implications\
    \ of technologies carrying (un)known and/or (un)knowable long-term risks, to highlight\
    \ failure cases, and to provide a mechanism by which the general public (and scientists\
    \ in other disciplines) can more readily engage in the discussion in an informed\
    \ manner. This simple proposal requires minimal additional up-front costs for\
    \ researchers; the lay summary, at least, has significant precedence in the medical\
    \ literature and other areas of science; and the proposal is aimed to supplement,\
    \ rather than replace, existing approaches for encouraging researchers to consider\
    \ the ethical implications of their work, such as those of the Collaborative Institutional\
    \ Training Initiative (CITI) Program and institutional review boards (IRBs)."

  abstract: "Conversational AI systems, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, are rapidly developing\
    \ from purely transactional systems to social chatbots, which can respond to a\
    \ wide variety of user requests. In this article, we establish how current state-of-the-art\
    \ conversational systems react to inappropriate requests, such as bullying and\
    \ sexual harassment on the part of the user, by collecting and analysing the novel\
    \ #MeTooAlexa corpus. Our results show that commercial systems mainly avoid answering,\
    \ while rule-based chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often deflect. Data-driven\
    \ systems, on the other hand, are often non-coherent, but also run the risk of\
    \ being interpreted as flirtatious and sometimes react with counter-aggression.\
    \ This includes our own system, trained on \u201Cclean\u201D data, which suggests\
    \ that inappropriate system behaviour is not caused by data bias."

    \ people to write four-line poems on a given metaphor, such as \u201Cdeath is\
    \ a rose\u201D or \u201Canger is wood\u201D. We find that only 21% of poems successfully\
    \ make a metaphorical connection. We present five alternate ways people respond\
    \ to the prompt and release our dataset of 100 categorized poems. We suggest opportunities\
    \ for computational approaches."

  abstract: Using linguistic features to detect figurative language has provided a
    deeper in-sight into figurative language. The purpose of this study is to assess
    whether linguistic features can help explain differences in quality of figurative
    language. In this study a large corpus of metaphors and sarcastic responses are
    collected from human subjects and rated for figurative language quality based
    on theoretical components of metaphor, sarcasm, and creativity. Using natural
    language processing tools, specific linguistic features related to lexical sophistication
    and semantic cohesion were used to predict the human ratings of figurative language
    quality. Results demonstrate linguistic features were able to predict small amounts
    of variance in metaphor and sarcasm production quality.

  abstract: Identification of metaphoric language in text is critical for generating
    effective semantic representations for natural language understanding. Computational
    approaches to metaphor identification have largely relied on heuristic based models
    or feature-based machine learning, using hand-crafted lexical resources coupled
    with basic syntactic information. However, recent work has shown the predictive
    power of syntactic constructions in determining metaphoric source and target domains
    (Sullivan 2013). Our work intends to explore syntactic constructions and their
    relation to metaphoric language. We undertake a corpus-based analysis of predicate-argument
    constructions and their metaphoric properties, and attempt to effectively represent
    syntactic constructions as features for metaphor processing, both in identifying
    source and target domains and in distinguishing metaphoric words from non-metaphoric.

  abstract: The paper addresses the classification of isolated Polish adjective-noun
    phrases according to their metaphoricity. We tested neural networks to predict
    if a phrase has a literal or metaphorical sense or can have both senses depending
    on usage. The input to the neural network consists of word embeddings, but we
    also tested the impact of information about the domain of the adjective and about
    the abstractness of the noun. We applied our solution to English data available
    on the Internet and compared it to results published in papers. We found that
    the solution based on word embeddings only can achieve results comparable with
    complex solutions requiring additional information.

  abstract: This paper presents an exploratory study on large-scale detection of idiomatic
    expressions in essays written by non-native speakers of English. We describe a
    computational search procedure for automatic detection of idiom-candidate phrases
    in essay texts. The study used a corpus of essays written during a standardized
    examination of English language proficiency. Automatically-flagged candidate expressions
    were manually annotated for idiomaticity. The study found that idioms are widely
    used in EFL essays. The study also showed that a search algorithm that accommodates
    the syntactic and lexical exibility of idioms can increase the recall of idiom
    instances by 30%, but it also increases the amount of false positives.

  abstract: We propose a new annotated corpus for metaphor interpretation by paraphrase,
    and a novel DNN model for performing this task. Our corpus consists of 200 sets
    of 5 sentences, with each set containing one reference metaphorical sentence,
    and four ranked candidate paraphrases. Our model is trained for a binary classification
    of paraphrase candidates, and then used to predict graded paraphrase acceptability.
    It reaches an encouraging 75% accuracy on the binary classification task, and
    high Pearson (.75) and Spearman (.68) correlations on the gradient judgment prediction
    task.

    is growing and as methods and data become increasingly diverse, it is important
    to create widely shared empirical knowledge of the level of system performance
    in a range of contexts, thus facilitating progress in this area. One way of creating
    such shared knowledge is through benchmarking multiple systems on a common dataset.
    We report on the shared task on metaphor identification on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor

  abstract: Automatic processing of figurative languages is gaining popularity in
    NLP community for their ubiquitous nature and increasing volume. In this era of
    web 2.0, automatic analysis of sarcasm and metaphors is important for their extensive
    usage. Metaphors are a part of figurative language that compares different concepts,
    often on a cognitive level. Many approaches have been proposed for automatic detection
    of metaphors, even using sequential models or neural networks. In this paper,
    we propose a method for detection of metaphors at the token level using a hybrid
    model of Bidirectional-LSTM and CRF. We used fewer features, as compared to the
    previous state-of-the-art sequential model. On experimentation with VUAMC, our
    method obtained an F-score of 0.674.

  abstract: Metaphor is a popular figure of speech. Popularity of metaphors calls
    for their automatic identification and interpretation. Most of the unsupervised
    methods directed at detection of metaphors use some hand-coded knowledge. We propose
    an unsupervised framework for metaphor detection that does not require any hand-coded
    knowledge. We applied clustering on features derived from Adjective-Noun pairs
    for classifying them into two disjoint classes. We experimented with adjective-noun
    pairs of a popular dataset annotated for metaphors and obtained an accuracy of
    72.87% with k-means clustering algorithm.

  abstract: Metaphor is an essential element of human cognition which is often used
    to express ideas and emotions that might be difficult to express using literal
    language. Processing metaphoric language is a challenging task for a wide range
    of applications ranging from text simplification to psychotherapy. Despite the
    variety of approaches that are trying to process metaphor, there is still a need
    for better models that mimic the human cognition while exploiting fewer resources.
    In this paper, we present an approach based on distributional semantics to identify
    metaphors on the phrase-level. We investigated the use of different word embeddings
    models to identify verb-noun pairs where the verb is used metaphorically. Several
    experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach on
    benchmark datasets.

  abstract: The current study seeks to implement a deep learning classification algorithm
    using argument-structure level representation of metaphoric constructions, for
    the identification of source domain mappings in metaphoric utterances. It thus
    builds on previous work in computational metaphor interpretation (Mohler et al.
    2014; Shutova 2010; Bollegala & Shutova 2013; Hong 2016; Su et al. 2017) while
    implementing a theoretical framework based off of work in the interface of metaphor
    and construction grammar (Sullivan 2006, 2007, 2013). The results indicate that
    it is possible to achieve an accuracy of approximately 80.4% using the proposed
    method, combining construction grammatical features with a simple deep learning
    NN. I attribute this increase in accuracy to the use of constructional cues, extracted
    from the raw text of metaphoric instances.

  abstract: "Metaphors are figurative languages widely used in daily life and literatures.\
    \ It\u2019s an important task to detect the metaphors evoked by texts. Thus, the\
    \ metaphor shared task is aimed to extract metaphors from plain texts at word\
    \ level. We propose to use a CNN-LSTM model for this task. Our model combines\
    \ CNN and LSTM layers to utilize both local and long-range contextual information\
    \ for identifying metaphorical information. In addition, we compare the performance\
    \ of the softmax classifier and conditional random field (CRF) for sequential\
    \ labeling in this task. We also incorporated some additional features such as\
    \ part of speech (POS) tags and word cluster to improve the performance of model.\
    \ Our best model achieved 65.06% F-score in the all POS testing subtask and 67.15%\
    \ in the verbs testing subtask."

  abstract: The contrast between the contextual and general meaning of a word serves
    as an important clue for detecting its metaphoricity. In this paper, we present
    a deep neural architecture for metaphor detection which exploits this contrast.
    Additionally, we also use cost-sensitive learning by re-weighting examples, and
    baseline features like concreteness ratings, POS and WordNet-based features. The
    best performing system of ours achieves an overall F1 score of 0.570 on All POS
    category and 0.605 on the Verbs category at the Metaphor Shared Task 2018.

  abstract: The paper addresses detection of figurative usage of words in English
    text. The chosen method was to use neural nets fed by pretrained word embeddings.
    The obtained results show that simple solutions, based on words embeddings only,
    are comparable to complex solutions, using many sources of information which are
    not available for languages less-studied than English.

  abstract: 'This paper describes multiple solutions designed and tested for the problem
    of word-level metaphor detection. The proposed systems are all based on variants
    of recurrent neural network architectures. Specifically, we explore multiple sources
    of information: pre-trained word embeddings (Glove), a dictionary of language
    concreteness and a transfer learning scenario based on the states of an encoder
    network from neural network machine translation system. One of the architectures
    is based on combining all three systems: (1) Neural CRF (Conditional Random Fields),
    trained directly on the metaphor data set; (2) Neural Machine Translation encoder
    of a transfer learning scenario; (3) a neural network used to predict final labels,
    trained directly on the metaphor data set. Our results vary between test sets:
    Neural CRF standalone is the best one on submission data, while combined system
    scores the highest on a test subset randomly selected from training data.'

    on metaphor detection on the Vrije University Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (VUA).
    The ST was part of the workshop on processing figurative language at the 16th
    annual conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational
    Linguistics (NAACL2018). The system combines a small assertion of trending techniques,
    which implement matured methods from NLP and ML; in particular, the system uses
    word embeddings from standard corpora and from corpora representing different
    proficiency levels of language learners in a LSTM BiRNN architecture. The system
    is available under the APLv2 open-source license.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tendency of end-to-end neural Machine
    Reading Comprehension (MRC) models to match shallow patterns rather than perform
    inference-oriented reasoning on RC benchmarks. We aim to test the ability of these
    systems to answer questions which focus on referential inference. We propose ParallelQA,
    a strategy to formulate such questions using parallel passages. We also demonstrate
    that existing neural models fail to generalize well to this setting.

  abstract: Commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet represent knowledge in
    the form of relational triples. Inspired by recent work by Li et al., we analyse
    if knowledge base completion models can be used to mine commonsense knowledge
    from raw text. We propose novelty of predicted triples with respect to the training
    set as an important factor in interpreting results. We critically analyse the
    difficulty of mining novel commonsense knowledge, and show that a simple baseline
    method that outperforms the previous state of the art on predicting more novel
    triples.

    \ like visual question answering, and argue that artificial data can be used to\
    \ address these as a complement to current practice. We demonstrate that with\
    \ the help of existing \u2018deep\u2019 linguistic processing technology we are\
    \ able to create challenging abstract datasets, which enable us to investigate\
    \ the language understanding abilities of multimodal deep learning models in detail,\

  abstract: "Seq2Seq based neural architectures have become the go-to architecture\
    \ to apply to sequence to sequence language tasks. Despite their excellent performance\
    \ on these tasks, recent work has noted that these models typically do not fully\
    \ capture the linguistic structure required to generalize beyond the dense sections\
    \ of the data distribution (Ettinger et al., 2017), and as such, are likely to\
    \ fail on examples from the tail end of the distribution (such as inputs that\
    \ are noisy (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018), or of different length (Bentivogli et al.,\
    \ 2016)). In this paper we look at a model\u2019s ability to generalize on a simple\
    \ symbol rewriting task with a clearly defined structure. We find that the model\u2019\
    s ability to generalize this structure beyond the training distribution depends\
    \ greatly on the chosen random seed, even when performance on the test set remains\
    \ the same. This finding suggests that model\u2019s ability to capture generalizable\
    \ structure is highly sensitive, and more so, this sensitivity may not be apparent\
    \ when evaluating the model on standard test sets."

  abstract: Most scholarly works in the field of computational detection of humour
    derive their inspiration from the incongruity theory. Incongruity is an indispensable
    facet in drawing a line between humorous and non-humorous occurrences but is immensely
    inadequate in shedding light on what actually made the particular occurrence a
    funny one. Classical theories like Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour and
    General Verbal Theory of Humour try and achieve this feat to an adequate extent.
    In this paper we adhere to a more holistic approach towards classification of
    humour based on these classical theories with a few improvements and revisions.
    Through experiments based on our linear approach and performed on large data-sets
    of jokes, we are able to demonstrate the adaptability and show componentizability
    of our model, and that a host of classification techniques can be used to overcome
    the challenging problem of distinguishing between various categories and sub-categories
    of jokes.

  abstract: 'Social media text is replete with unusual capitalization patterns. We
    posit that capitalizing a token like THIS performs two expressive functions: it
    marks a person socially, and marks certain parts of an utterance as more salient
    than others. Focusing on gender and sentiment, we illustrate using a corpus of
    tweets that capitalization appears in more negative than positive contexts, and
    is used more by females compared to males. Yet we find that both genders use capitalization
    in a similar way when expressing sentiment.'

  abstract: Hate speech detection in social media texts is an important Natural language
    Processing task, which has several crucial applications like sentiment analysis,
    investigating cyberbullying and examining socio-political controversies. While
    relevant research has been done independently on code-mixed social media texts
    and hate speech detection, our work is the first attempt in detecting hate speech
    in Hindi-English code-mixed social media text. In this paper, we analyze the problem
    of hate speech detection in code-mixed texts and present a Hindi-English code-mixed
    dataset consisting of tweets posted online on Twitter. The tweets are annotated
    with the language at word level and the class they belong to (Hate Speech or Normal
    Speech). We also propose a supervised classification system for detecting hate
    speech in the text using various character level, word level, and lexicon based
    features.

  abstract: Over the years, natural language processing has increasingly focused on
    tasks that can be solved by statistical models, but ignored the social aspects
    of language. These limitations are in large part due to historically available
    data and the limitations of the models, but have narrowed our focus and biased
    the tools demographically. However, with the increased availability of data sets
    including socio-demographic information and more expressive (neural) models, we
    have the opportunity to address both issues. I argue that this combination can
    broaden the focus of NLP to solve a whole new range of tasks, enable us to generate
    novel linguistic insights, and provide fairer tools for everyone.

  abstract: "Twitter is a ubiquitous source of micro-blog social media data, providing\
    \ the academic, industrial, and public sectors real-time access to actionable\
    \ information. A particularly attractive property of some tweets is *geo-tagging*,\
    \ where a user account has opted-in to attaching their current location to each\
    \ message. Unfortunately (from a researcher\u2019s perspective) only a fraction\
    \ of Twitter accounts agree to this, and these accounts are likely to have systematic\
    \ diffences with the general population. This work is an exploratory study of\
    \ these differences across the full range of Twitter content, and complements\
    \ previous studies that focus on the English-language subset. Additionally, we\
    \ compare methods for querying users by self-identified properties, finding that\
    \ the constrained semantics of the \u201Cdescription\u201D field provides cleaner,\
    \ higher-volume results than more complex regular expressions."

  abstract: 'Twitter user accounts include a range of different user types. While
    many individuals use Twitter, organizations also have Twitter accounts. Identifying
    opinions and trends from Twitter requires the accurate differentiation of these
    two groups. Previous work (McCorriston et al., 2015) presented a method for determining
    if an account was an individual or organization based on account profile and a
    collection of tweets. We present a method that relies solely on the account profile,
    allowing for the classification of individuals versus organizations based on a
    single tweet. Our method obtains accuracies comparable to methods that rely on
    much more information by leveraging two improvements: a character-based Convolutional
    Neural Network, and an automatically derived labeled corpus an order of magnitude
    larger than the previously available dataset. We make both the dataset and the
    resulting tool available.'

  abstract: The paper provides an outline of the scope for synergy between computational
    linguistic analysis and population stud-ies. It first reviews where population
    studies stand in terms of using social media data. Demographers are entering the
    realm of big data in force. But, this paper argues, population studies have much
    to gain from computational linguis-tic analysis, especially in terms of ex-plaining
    the drivers behind population processes. The paper gives two examples of how the
    method can be applied, and concludes with a fundamental caveat. Yes, computational
    linguistic analysis provides a possible key for integrating micro theory into
    any demographic analysis of social media data. But results may be of little value
    in as much as knowledge about fundamental sample characteristics are unknown.

  abstract: "Email conversations are the primary mode of communication in enterprises.\
    \ The email content expresses an individual\u2019s needs, requirements and intentions.\
    \ Affective information in the email text can be used to get an insight into the\
    \ sender\u2019s mood or emotion. We present a novel approach to model human frustration\
    \ in text. We identify linguistic features that influence human perception of\
    \ frustration and model it as a supervised learning task. The paper provides a\
    \ detailed comparison across traditional regression and word distribution-based\
    \ models. We report a mean-squared error (MSE) of 0.018 against human-annotated\
    \ frustration for the best performing model. The approach establishes the importance\
    \ of affect features in frustration prediction for email data. We further evaluate\
    \ the efficacy of the proposed feature set and model in predicting other tone\
    \ or affects in text, namely formality and politeness; results demonstrate a comparable\
    \ performance against the state-of-the-art baselines."

  abstract: Automated personality prediction from social media is gaining increasing
    attention in natural language processing and social sciences communities. However,
    due to high labeling costs and privacy issues, the few publicly available datasets
    are of limited size and low topic diversity. We address this problem by introducing
    a large-scale dataset derived from Reddit, a source so far overlooked for personality
    prediction. The dataset is labeled with Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI) and
    comes with a rich set of features for more than 9k users. We carry out a preliminary
    feature analysis, revealing marked differences between the MBTI dimensions and
    poles. Furthermore, we use the dataset to train and evaluate benchmark personality
    prediction models, achieving macro F1-scores between 67% and 82% on the individual
    dimensions and 82% accuracy for exact or one-off accurate type prediction. These
    results are encouraging and comparable with the reliability of standardized tests.

  abstract: "Written text transmits a good deal of nonverbal information related to\
    \ the author\u2019s identity and social factors, such as age, gender and personality.\
    \ However, it is less known to what extent behavioral biometric traces transmit\
    \ such information. We use typist data to study the predictiveness of authorship,\
    \ and present first experiments on predicting both age and gender from keystroke\
    \ dynamics. Our results show that the model based on keystroke features, while\
    \ being two orders of magnitude smaller, leads to significantly higher accuracies\
    \ for authorship than the text-based system. For user attribute prediction, the\
    \ best approach is to combine the two, suggesting that extralinguistic factors\
    \ are disclosed to a larger degree in written text, while author identity is better\
    \ transmitted in typing behavior."

  abstract: Recent studies in the field of text-based personality recognition experiment
    with different languages, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning
    algorithms to create better and more accurate models; however, little focus is
    placed on exploring the language use of a group of individuals defined by nationality.
    Individuals of the same nationality share certain practices and communicate certain
    ideas that can become embedded into their natural language. Many nationals are
    also not limited to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino
    and English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of several
    regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of code-switching, allow
    for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This presents an opportunity to create
    a text-based personality model based on how Filipinos speak, regardless of the
    language they use. To do so, data was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users.
    Different combinations of data processing techniques were experimented upon to
    create personality models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression
    and classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest trait
    to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for Agreeableness and
    Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed better than those of Openness.
    An analysis on personality trait score representation showed that classifying
    extreme outliers generally produce better results for all traits except for Neuroticism
    and Openness.

  abstract: Neural machine translation has achieved impressive results in the last
    few years, but its success has been limited to settings with large amounts of
    parallel data. One way to improve NMT for lower-resource settings is to initialize
    a word-based NMT model with pretrained word embeddings. However, rare words still
    suffer from lower quality word embeddings when trained with standard word-level
    objectives. We introduce word embeddings that utilize morphological resources,
    and compare to purely unsupervised alternatives. We work with Arabic, a morphologically
    rich language with available linguistic resources, and perform Ar-to-En MT experiments
    on a small corpus of TED subtitles. We find that word embeddings utilizing subword
    information consistently outperform standard word embeddings on a word similarity
    task and as initialization of the source word embeddings in a low-resource NMT
    system.

  abstract: Recent literature has shown a wide variety of benefits to mapping traditional
    one-hot representations of words and phrases to lower-dimensional real-valued
    vectors known as word embeddings. Traditionally, most word embedding algorithms
    treat each word as the finest meaningful semantic granularity and perform embedding
    by learning distinct embedding vectors for each word. Contrary to this line of
    thought, technical domains such as scientific and medical literature compose words
    from subword structures such as prefixes, suffixes, and root-words as well as
    compound words. Treating individual words as the finest-granularity unit discards
    meaningful shared semantic structure between words sharing substructures. This
    not only leads to poor embeddings for text corpora that have long-tail distributions,
    but also heuristic methods for handling out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper
    we propose SubwordMine, an entropy-based subword mining algorithm that is fast,
    unsupervised, and fully data-driven. We show that this allows for great cross-domain
    performance in identifying semantically meaningful subwords. We then investigate
    utilizing the mined subwords within the FastText embedding model and compare performance
    of the learned representations in a downstream language modeling task.

  abstract: This paper seeks to examine the effect of including background knowledge
    in the form of character pre-trained neural language model (LM), and data bootstrapping
    to overcome the problem of unbalanced limited resources. As a test, we explore
    the task of language identification in mixed-language short non-edited texts with
    an under-resourced language, namely the case of Algerian Arabic for which both
    labelled and unlabelled data are limited. We compare the performance of two traditional
    machine learning methods and a deep neural networks (DNNs) model. The results
    show that overall DNNs perform better on labelled data for the majority categories
    and struggle with the minority ones. While the effect of the untokenised and unlabelled
    data encoded as LM differs for each category, bootstrapping, however, improves
    the performance of all systems and all categories. These methods are language
    independent and could be generalised to other under-resourced languages for which
    a small labelled data and a larger unlabelled data are available.

  abstract: "Most modern approaches to computing word embeddings assume the availability\
    \ of text corpora with billions of words. In this paper, we explore a setup where\
    \ only corpora with millions of words are available, and many words in any new\
    \ text are out of vocabulary. This setup is both of practical interests \u2013\
    \ modeling the situation for specific domains and low-resource languages \u2013\
    \ and of psycholinguistic interest, since it corresponds much more closely to\
    \ the actual experiences and challenges of human language learning and use. We\
    \ compare standard skip-gram word embeddings with character-based embeddings on\
    \ word relatedness prediction. Skip-grams excel on large corpora, while character-based\
    \ embeddings do well on small corpora generally and rare and complex words specifically.\
    \ The models can be combined easily."

  abstract: Subword-level information is crucial for capturing the meaning and morphology
    of words, especially for out-of-vocabulary entries. We propose CNN- and RNN-based
    subword-level composition functions for learning word embeddings, and systematically
    compare them with popular word-level and subword-level models (Skip-Gram and FastText).
    Additionally, we propose a hybrid training scheme in which a pure subword-level
    model is trained jointly with a conventional word-level embedding model based
    on lookup-tables. This increases the fitness of all types of subword-level word
    embeddings; the word-level embeddings can be discarded after training, leaving
    only compact subword-level representation with much smaller data volume. We evaluate
    these embeddings on a set of intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, showing that subword-level
    models have advantage on tasks related to morphology and datasets with high OOV
    rate, and can be combined with other types of embeddings.

  abstract: We introduce a simple method for extracting non-arbitrary form-meaning
    representations from a collection of semantic vectors. We treat the problem as
    one of feature selection for a model trained to predict word vectors from subword
    features. We apply this model to the problem of automatically discovering phonesthemes,
    which are submorphemic sound clusters that appear in words with similar meaning.
    Many of our model-predicted phonesthemes overlap with those proposed in the linguistics
    literature, and we validate our approach with human judgments.

  abstract: 'We explore the use of two independent subsystems Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
    and Morfessor as basic units for subword-level neural machine translation (NMT).
    We show that, for linguistically distant language-pairs Morfessor-based segmentation
    algorithm produces significantly better quality translation than BPE. However,
    for close language-pairs BPE-based subword-NMT may translate better than Morfessor-based
    subword-NMT. We propose a combined approach of these two segmentation algorithms
    Morfessor-BPE (M-BPE) which outperforms these two baseline systems in terms of
    BLEU score. Our results are supported by experiments on three language-pairs:
    English-Hindi, Bengali-Hindi and English-Bengali.'

  abstract: "We present early results from a system under development which uses sub-word\
    \ embeddings for query expansion in presence of mis-spelled words and other aberrations.\
    \ We work for a company which creates accounting software and the end goal is\
    \ to improve customer experience when they search for help on our \u201CCustomer\
    \ Care\u201D portal. Our customers use colloquial language, non-standard acronyms\
    \ and sometimes mis-spell words when they use our Search portal or interact over\
    \ other channels. However, our Knowledge Base has curated content which leverages\
    \ technical terms and is in language which is quite formal. This results in the\
    \ answer not being retrieved even though the answer might actually be present\
    \ in the documentation (as assessed by a human). We address this problem by creating\
    \ equivalence classes of words with similar meanings (with the additional property\
    \ that the mappings to these equivalence classes are robust to mis-spellings)\
    \ using sub-word embeddings and then use them to fine tune an Elasticsearch index\
    \ to improve recall. We demonstrate through an end-end system that using sub-word\
    \ embeddings leads to a significant lift in correct answers retrieved for an accounting\

  abstract: The positive effect of adding subword information to word embeddings has
    been demonstrated for predictive models. In this paper we investigate whether
    similar benefits can also be derived from incorporating subwords into counting
    models. We evaluate the impact of different types of subwords (n-grams and unsupervised
    morphemes), with results confirming the importance of subword information in learning
    representations of rare and out-of-vocabulary words.

  abstract: Brain-computer interfaces and other augmentative and alternative communication
    devices introduce language-modeing challenges distinct from other character-entry
    methods. In particular, the acquired signal of the EEG (electroencephalogram)
    signal is noisier, which, in turn, makes the user intent harder to decipher. In
    order to adapt to this condition, we propose to maintain ambiguous history for
    every time step, and to employ, apart from the character language model, word
    information to produce a more robust prediction system. We present preliminary
    results that compare this proposed Online-Context Language Model (OCLM) to current
    algorithms that are used in this type of setting. Evaluation on both perplexity
    and predictive accuracy demonstrates promising results when dealing with ambiguous
    histories in order to provide to the front end a distribution of the next character
    the user might type.

  abstract: We describe a novel method for identifying hedge terms using a set of
    manually constructed rules. We present experiments adding hedge features to a
    committed belief system to improve classification. We compare performance of this
    system (a) without hedging features, (b) with dictionary-based features, and (c)
    with rule-based features. We find that using hedge features improves performance
    of the committed belief system, particularly in identifying instances of non-committed
    belief and reported belief.

  abstract: Currently, news articles are produced, shared and consumed at an extremely
    rapid rate. Although their quantity is increasing, at the same time, their quality
    and trustworthiness is becoming fuzzier. Hence, it is important not only to automate
    information extraction but also to quantify the certainty of this information.
    Automated identification of certainty has been studied both in the scientific
    and newswire domains, but performance is considerably higher in tasks focusing
    on scientific text. We compare the differences in the definition and expression
    of uncertainty between a scientific domain, i.e., biomedicine, and newswire. We
    delve into the different aspects that affect the certainty of an extracted event
    in a news article and examine whether they can be easily identified by techniques
    already validated in the biomedical domain. Finally, we present a comparison of
    the syntactic and lexical differences between the the expression of certainty
    in the biomedical and newswire domains, using two annotated corpora.

  abstract: This paper describes the first version of an open-source semantic parser
    that creates graphical representations of sentences to be used for further semantic
    processing, e.g. for natural language inference, reasoning and semantic similarity.
    The Graphical Knowledge Representation which is output by the parser is inspired
    by the Abstract Knowledge Representation, which separates out conceptual and contextual
    levels of representation that deal respectively with the subject matter of a sentence
    and its existential commitments. Our representation is a layered graph with each
    sub-graph holding different kinds of information, including one sub-graph for
    concepts and one for contexts. Our first evaluation of the system shows an F-score
    of 85% in accurately representing sentences as semantic graphs.

  abstract: "The classical view on argumentation, such that arguments are logical\
    \ structures consisting of different distinguishable parts and that parties exchange\
    \ arguments in a rational way, is prevalent in textbooks but nonexistent in the\
    \ real world. Instead, argumentation is a multifaceted communication tool built\
    \ upon humans\u2019 capabilities to easily use common sense, emotions, and social\
    \ context. As humans, we are pretty good at it. Computational Argumentation tries\
    \ to tackle these phenomena but has a long and not so easy way to go. In this\
    \ talk, I would like to shed a light on several recent attempts to deal with argumentation\
    \ computationally, such as addressing argument quality, understanding argument\
    \ reasoning, dealing with fallacies, and how should we never ever argue online."

  abstract: 'The challenge for computational models of spatial descriptions for situated
    dialogue systems is the integration of information from different modalities.
    The semantics of spatial descriptions are grounded in at least two sources of
    information: (i) a geometric representation of space and (ii) the functional interaction
    of related objects that. We train several neural language models on descriptions
    of scenes from a dataset of image captions and examine whether the functional
    or geometric bias of spatial descriptions reported in the literature is reflected
    in the estimated perplexity of these models. The results of these experiments
    have implications for the creation of models of spatial lexical semantics for
    human-robot dialogue systems. Furthermore, they also provide an insight into the
    kinds of the semantic knowledge captured by neural language models trained on
    spatial descriptions, which has implications for image captioning systems.'

  abstract: We demonstrate a system for understanding natural language utterances
    for structure description and placement in a situated blocks world context. By
    relying on a rich, domain-specific adaptation of a generic ontology and a logical
    form structure produced by a semantic parser, we obviate the need for an intermediate,
    domain-specific representation and can produce a reasoner that grounds and reasons
    over concepts and constraints with real-valued data. This linguistic base enables
    more flexibility in interpreting natural language expressions invoking intrinsic
    concepts and features of structures and space. We demonstrate some of the capabilities
    of a system grounded in deep language understanding and present initial results
    in a structure learning task.

  abstract: "Developing computational models of spatial prepositions (such as on,\
    \ in, above, etc.) is crucial for such tasks as human-machine collaboration, story\
    \ understanding, and 3D model generation from descriptions. However, these prepositions\
    \ are notoriously vague and ambiguous, with meanings depending on the types, shapes\
    \ and sizes of entities in the argument positions, the physical and task context,\
    \ and other factors. As a result truth value judgments for prepositional relations\
    \ are often uncertain and variable. In this paper we treat the modeling task as\
    \ calling for assignment of probabilities to such relations as a function of multiple\
    \ factors, where such probabilities can be viewed as estimates of whether humans\
    \ would judge the relations to hold in given circumstances. We implemented our\
    \ models in a 3D blocks world and a room world in a computer graphics setting,\
    \ and found that true/false judgments based on these models do not differ much\
    \ more from human judgments that the latter differ from one another. However,\
    \ what really matters pragmatically is not the accuracy of truth value judgments\
    \ but whether, for instance, the computer models suffice for identifying objects\
    \ described in terms of prepositional relations, (e.g., \u201Cthe box to the left\
    \ of the table\u201D, where there are multiple boxes). For such tasks, our models\
    \ achieved accuracies above 90% for most relations."

  abstract: "Prior methodologies for understanding spatial language have treated literal\
    \ expressions such as \u201CMary pushed the car over the edge\u201D differently\
    \ from metaphorical extensions such as \u201CMary\u2019s job pushed her over the\
    \ edge\u201D. We demonstrate a methodology for standardizing literal and metaphorical\
    \ meanings, by building on work in Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS), a general-purpose\
    \ representational component used in machine translation. We argue that spatial\
    \ predicates naturally extend into other fields (e.g., circumstantial or temporal),\
    \ and that LCS provides both a framework for distinguishing spatial from non-spatial,\
    \ and a system for finding metaphorical meaning extensions. We start with MetaNet\
    \ (MN), a large repository of conceptual metaphors, condensing 197 spatial entries\
    \ into sixteen top-level categories of motion frames. Using naturally occurring\
    \ instances of English push , and expansions of MN frames, we demonstrate that\
    \ literal and metaphorical extensions exhibit patterns predicted and represented\
    \ by the LCS model."

  abstract: While humans use natural language to express spatial relations between
    and across entities in the world with great facility, natural language systems
    have a facility that depends on that human facility. This position paper presents
    approach to representing spatial relations in language, and advocates its adoption
    for representing the meaning of spatial language. This work shows the importance
    of axis-orientation systems for capturing the complexity of spatial relations,
    which FrameNet encodes with semantic types.

  abstract: Spatial language understanding is important for practical applications
    and as a building block for better abstract language understanding. Much progress
    has been made through work on understanding spatial relations and values in images
    and texts as well as on giving and following navigation instructions in restricted
    domains. We argue that the next big advances in spatial language understanding
    can be best supported by creating large-scale datasets that focus on points and
    paths based in the real world, and then extending these to create online, persistent
    playscapes that mix human and bot players, where the bot players must learn, evolve,
    and survive according to their depth of understanding of scenes, navigation, and
    interactions.

  abstract: Spatial relation extraction from generic text is a challenging problem
    due to the ambiguity of the prepositions spatial meaning as well as the nesting
    structure of the spatial descriptions. In this work, we highlight the difficulties
    that the anaphora can make in the extraction of spatial relations. We use external
    multi-modal (here visual) resources to find the most probable candidates for resolving
    the anaphoras that refer to the landmarks of the spatial relations. We then use
    global inference to decide jointly on resolving the anaphora and extraction of
    the spatial relations. Our preliminary results show that resolving anaphora improves
    the state-of-the-art results on spatial relation extraction.

  abstract: This position paper argues that, while prior work in spatial language
    understanding for tasks such as robot navigation focuses on mapping natural language
    into deep conceptual or non-linguistic representations, it is possible to systematically
    derive regular patterns of spatial language usage from existing lexical-semantic
    resources. Furthermore, even with access to such resources, effective solutions
    to many application areas such as robot navigation and narrative generation also
    require additional knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface to cover the wide
    range of spatial expressions observed and available to natural language speakers.
    We ground our insights in, and present our extensions to, an existing lexico-semantic
    resource, covering 500 semantic classes of verbs, of which 219 fall within a spatial
    subset. We demonstrate that these extensions enable systematic derivation of regular
    patterns of spatial language without requiring manual annotation.

  abstract: In this opinion piece, we argue that there is a need for alternative design
    directions to complement existing AI efforts in narrative and character generation
    and algorithm development. To make our argument, we a) outline the predominant
    roles and goals of AI research in storytelling; b) present existing discourse
    on the benefits and harms of narratives; and c) highlight the pain points in character
    creation revealed by semi-structured interviews we conducted with 14 individuals
    deeply involved in some form of character creation. We conclude by proffering
    several specific design avenues that we believe can seed fruitful research collaborations.
    In our vision, AI collaborates with humans during creative processes and narrative
    generation, helps amplify voices and perspectives that are currently marginalized
    or misrepresented, and engenders experiences of narrative that support spectatorship
    and listening roles.

  abstract: "We examine an emerging NLP application that supports creative writing\
    \ by automatically suggesting continuing sentences in a story. The application\
    \ tracks users\u2019 modifications to generated sentences, which can be used to\
    \ quantify their \u201Chelpfulness\u201D in advancing the story. We explore the\
    \ task of predicting helpfulness based on automatically detected linguistic features\
    \ of the suggestions. We illustrate this analysis on a set of user interactions\
    \ with the application using an initial selection of features relevant to story\
    \ generation."

  abstract: 'Computational visual storytelling produces a textual description of events
    and interpretations depicted in a sequence of images. These texts are made possible
    by advances and cross-disciplinary approaches in natural language processing,
    generation, and computer vision. We define a computational creative visual storytelling
    as one with the ability to alter the telling of a story along three aspects: to
    speak about different environments, to produce variations based on narrative goals,
    and to adapt the narrative to the audience. These aspects of creative storytelling
    and their effect on the narrative have yet to be explored in visual storytelling.
    This paper presents a pipeline of task-modules, Object Identification, Single-Image
    Inferencing, and Multi-Image Narration, that serve as a preliminary design for
    building a creative visual storyteller. We have piloted this design for a sequence
    of images in an annotation task. We present and analyze the collected corpus and
    describe plans towards automation.'

  abstract: Soundtracks play an important role in carrying the story of a film. In
    this work, we collect a corpus of movies and television shows matched with subtitles
    and soundtracks and analyze the relationship between story, song, and audience
    reception. We look at the content of a film through the lens of its latent topics
    and at the content of a song through descriptors of its musical attributes. In
    two experiments, we find first that individual topics are strongly associated
    with musical attributes, and second, that musical attributes of soundtracks are
    predictive of film ratings, even after controlling for topic and genre.

  abstract: We present a general framework of analyzing existing story corpora to
    generate controllable and creative new stories. The proposed framework needs little
    manual annotation to achieve controllable story generation. It creates a new interface
    for humans to interact with computers to generate personalized stories. We apply
    the framework to build recurrent neural network (RNN)-based generation models
    to control story ending valence and storyline. Experiments show that our methods
    successfully achieve the control and enhance the coherence of stories through
    introducing storylines. with additional control factors, the generation model
    gets lower perplexity, and yields more coherent stories that are faithful to the
    control factors according to human evaluation.

  abstract: We address the task of predicting causally related events in stories according
    to a standard evaluation framework, the Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA).
    We present a neural encoder-decoder model that learns to predict relations between
    adjacent sequences in stories as a means of modeling causality. We explore this
    approach using different methods for extracting and representing sequence pairs
    as well as different model architectures. We also compare the impact of different
    training datasets on our model. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of
    a corpus not previously applied to COPA, the ROCStories corpus. While not state-of-the-art,
    our results establish a new reference point for systems evaluated on COPA, and
    one that is particularly informative for future neural-based approaches.

  abstract: Social media features substantial stylistic variation, raising new challenges
    for syntactic analysis of online writing. However, this variation is often aligned
    with author attributes such as age, gender, and geography, as well as more readily-available
    social network metadata. In this paper, we report new evidence on the link between
    language and social networks in the task of part-of-speech tagging. We find that
    tagger error rates are correlated with network structure, with high accuracy in
    some parts of the network, and lower accuracy elsewhere. As a result, tagger accuracy
    depends on training from a balanced sample of the network, rather than training
    on texts from a narrow subcommunity. We also describe our attempts to add robustness
    to stylistic variation, by building a mixture-of-experts model in which each expert
    is associated with a region of the social network. While prior work found that
    similar approaches yield performance improvements in sentiment analysis and entity
    linking, we were unable to obtain performance improvements in part-of-speech tagging,
    despite strong evidence for the link between part-of-speech error rates and social
    network structure.

  abstract: "We present a machine learning approach to distinguish texts translated\
    \ to Chinese (by humans) from texts originally written in Chinese, with a focus\
    \ on a wide range of syntactic features. Using Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\
    \ as classifier on a genre-balanced corpus in translation studies of Chinese,\
    \ we find that constituent parse trees and dependency triples as features without\
    \ lexical information perform very well on the task, with an F-measure above 90%,\
    \ close to the results of lexical n-gram features, without the risk of learning\
    \ topic information rather than translation features. Thus, we claim syntactic\
    \ features alone can accurately distinguish translated from original Chinese.\
    \ Translated Chinese exhibits an increased use of determiners, subject position\
    \ pronouns, NP + \u201C\u7684\u201D as NP modifiers, multiple NPs or VPs conjoined\
    \ by \"\u3001\", among other structures. We also interpret the syntactic features\

  abstract: Language generation tasks that seek to mimic human ability to use language
    creatively are difficult to evaluate, since one must consider creativity, style,
    and other non-trivial aspects of the generated text. The goal of this paper is
    to develop evaluations methods for one such task, ghostwriting of rap lyrics,
    and to provide an explicit, quantifiable foundation for the goals and future directions
    for this task. Ghostwriting must produce text that is similar in style to the
    emulated artist, yet distinct in content. We develop a novel evaluation methodology
    that addresses several complementary aspects of this task, and illustrate how
    such evaluation can be used to meaning fully analyze system performance. We provide
    a corpus of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for stylistic similarity, which
    allows us to assess the feasibility of manual evaluation for generated verse.

  abstract: In this paper, we approach the task of native language identification
    in a realistic cross-corpus scenario where a model is trained with available data
    and has to predict the native language from data of a different corpus. The motivation
    behind this study is to investigate native language identification in the Australian
    academic scenario where a majority of students come from China, Indonesia, and
    Arabic-speaking nations. We have proposed a statistical embedding representation
    reporting a significant improvement over common single-layer approaches of the
    state of the art, identifying Chinese, Arabic, and Indonesian in a cross-corpus
    scenario. The proposed approach was shown to be competitive even when the data
    is scarce and imbalanced.

  abstract: "We introduce a machine learning approach for the identification of \u201C\
    white spaces\u201D in scientific knowledge. Our approach addresses this task as\
    \ link prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such\
    \ as \u201CCTCF activates FOXA1\u201D, which were automatically extracted using\
    \ open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using graph-based\
    \ features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as from a citation\
    \ graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated the proposed approach\
    \ through backtesting. Although the data is heavily unbalanced (50 times more\
    \ negative examples than positives), our approach predicts which influence links\
    \ will be discovered in the \u201Cnear future\u201D with a F1 score of 27 points,\
    \ and a mean average precision of 68%."

  abstract: Corpus2graph is an open-source NLP-application-oriented tool that generates
    a word co-occurrence network from a large corpus. It not only contains different
    built-in methods to preprocess words, analyze sentences, extract word pairs and
    define edge weights, but also supports user-customized functions. By using parallelization
    techniques, it can generate a large word co-occurrence network of the whole English
    Wikipedia data within hours. And thanks to its nodes-edges-weight three-level
    progressive calculation design, rebuilding networks with different configurations
    is even faster as it does not need to start all over again. This tool also works
    with other graph libraries such as igraph, NetworkX and graph-tool as a front
    end providing data to boost network generation speed.

  abstract: "Question Answering for complex questions is often modelled as a graph\
    \ construction or traversal task, where a solver must build or traverse a graph\
    \ of facts that answer and explain a given question. This \u201Cmulti-hop\u201D\
    \ inference has been shown to be extremely challenging, with few models able to\
    \ aggregate more than two facts before being overwhelmed by \u201Csemantic drift\u201D\
    , or the tendency for long chains of facts to quickly drift off topic. This is\
    \ a major barrier to current inference models, as even elementary science questions\
    \ require an average of 4 to 6 facts to answer and explain. In this work we empirically\
    \ characterize the difficulty of building or traversing a graph of sentences connected\
    \ by lexical overlap, by evaluating chance sentence aggregation quality through\
    \ 9,784 manually-annotated judgements across knowledge graphs built from three\
    \ free-text corpora (including study guides and Simple Wikipedia). We demonstrate\
    \ semantic drift tends to be high and aggregation quality low, at between 0.04\
    \ and 3, and highlight scenarios that maximize the likelihood of meaningfully\
    \ combining information."

  abstract: Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC) aims to generate a short sentence with
    key information from a cluster of closely related sentences. MSC enables summarization
    and question-answering systems to generate outputs combining fully formed sentences
    from one or several documents. This paper describes a new Integer Linear Programming
    method for MSC using a vertex-labeled graph to select different keywords, and
    novel 3-gram scores to generate more informative sentences while maintaining their
    grammaticality. Our system is of good quality and outperforms the state-of-the-art
    for evaluations led on news dataset. We led both automatic and manual evaluations
    to determine the informativeness and the grammaticality of compressions for each
    dataset. Additional tests, which take advantage of the fact that the length of
    compressions can be modulated, still improve ROUGE scores with shorter output
    sentences.

  abstract: Spectral clustering has received a lot of attention due to its ability
    to separate nonconvex, non-intersecting manifolds, but its high computational
    complexity has significantly limited its applicability. Motivated by the document-term
    co-clustering framework by Dhillon (2001), we propose a landmark-based scalable
    spectral clustering approach in which we first use the selected landmark set and
    the given data to form a bipartite graph and then run a diffusion process on it
    to obtain a family of diffusion coordinates for clustering. We show that our proposed
    algorithm can be implemented based on very efficient operations on the affinity
    matrix between the given data and selected landmarks, thus capable of handling
    large data. Finally, we demonstrate the excellent performance of our method by
    comparing with the state-of-the-art scalable algorithms on several benchmark data
    sets.

  abstract: Word sense induction (WSI), which addresses polysemy by unsupervised discovery
    of multiple word senses, resolves ambiguities for downstream NLP tasks and also
    makes word representations more interpretable. This paper proposes an accurate
    and efficient graph-based method for WSI that builds a global non-negative vector
    embedding basis (which are interpretable like topics) and clusters the basis indexes
    in the ego network of each polysemous word. By adopting distributional inclusion
    vector embeddings as our basis formation model, we avoid the expensive step of
    nearest neighbor search that plagues other graph-based methods without sacrificing
    the quality of sense clusters. Experiments on three datasets show that our proposed
    method produces similar or better sense clusters and embeddings compared with
    previous state-of-the-art methods while being significantly more efficient.

  abstract: Contrary to the traditional Bag-of-Words approach, we consider the Graph-of-Words(GoW)
    model in which each document is represented by a graph that encodes relationships
    between the different terms. Based on this formulation, the importance of a term
    is determined by weighting the corresponding node in the document, collection
    and label graphs, using node centrality criteria. We also introduce novel graph-based
    weighting schemes by enriching graphs with word-embedding similarities, in order
    to reward or penalize semantic relationships. Our methods produce more discriminative
    feature weights for text categorization, outperforming existing frequency-based
    criteria.

  abstract: "Natural language text exhibits hierarchical structure in a variety of\
    \ respects. Ideally, we could incorporate our prior knowledge of this hierarchical\
    \ structure into unsupervised learning algorithms that work on text data. Recent\
    \ work by Nickel and Kiela (2017) proposed using hyperbolic instead of Euclidean\
    \ embedding spaces to represent hierarchical data and demonstrated encouraging\
    \ results when embedding graphs. In this work, we extend their method with a re-parameterization\
    \ technique that allows us to learn hyperbolic embeddings of arbitrarily parameterized\
    \ objects. We apply this framework to learn word and sentence embeddings in hyperbolic\
    \ space in an unsupervised manner from text corpora. The resulting embeddings\
    \ seem to encode certain intuitive notions of hierarchy, such as word-context\
    \ frequency and phrase constituency. However, the implicit continuous hierarchy\
    \ in the learned hyperbolic space makes interrogating the model\u2019s learned\
    \ hierarchies more difficult than for models that learn explicit edges between\
    \ items. The learned hyperbolic embeddings show improvements over Euclidean embeddings\
    \ in some \u2013 but not all \u2013 downstream tasks, suggesting that hierarchical\
    \ organization is more useful for some tasks than others."

  abstract: Functioning is gaining recognition as an important indicator of global
    health, but remains under-studied in medical natural language processing research.
    We present the first analysis of automatically extracting descriptions of patient
    mobility, using a recently-developed dataset of free text electronic health records.
    We frame the task as a named entity recognition (NER) problem, and investigate
    the applicability of NER techniques to mobility extraction. As text corpora focused
    on patient functioning are scarce, we explore domain adaptation of word embeddings
    for use in a recurrent neural network NER system. We find that embeddings trained
    on a small in-domain corpus perform nearly as well as those learned from large
    out-of-domain corpora, and that domain adaptation techniques yield additional
    improvements in both precision and recall. Our analysis identifies several significant
    challenges in extracting descriptions of patient mobility, including the length
    and complexity of annotated entities and high linguistic variability in mobility
    descriptions.

  abstract: Automatic identification of heart disease risk factors in clinical narratives
    can expedite disease progression modelling and support clinical decisions. Existing
    practical solutions for cardiovascular risk detection are mostly hybrid systems
    entailing the integration of knowledge-driven and data-driven methods, relying
    on dictionaries, rules and machine learning methods that require a substantial
    amount of human effort. This paper proposes a comparative analysis on the applicability
    of deep learning, a re-emerged data-driven technique, in the context of clinical
    text classification. Various deep learning architectures were devised and evaluated
    for extracting heart disease risk factors from clinical documents. The data provided
    for the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task focusing on identifying risk factors for
    heart disease was used for system development and evaluation. Results have shown
    that a relatively simple deep learning model can achieve a high micro-averaged
    F-measure of 0.9081, which is comparable to the best systems from the shared task.
    This is highly encouraging given the simplicity of the deep learning approach
    compared to the heavily feature-engineered hybrid approaches that were required
    to achieve state-of-the-art performances.

    from the healthcare user-generated contents. We employ deep learning architecture,
    i.e. Long Short-Term Memory, and leverage word embeddings, medical concepts from
    a knowledge base, and linguistic components as our features. The proposed model
    achieves 61.37% F-1 score. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach
    outperforms the baseline methods, i.e. RAKE and CRF, on the task of extracting

  abstract: 'We present a machine learning pipeline that identifies key sentences
    in abstracts of oncological articles to aid evidence-based medicine. This problem
    is characterized by the lack of gold standard datasets, data imbalance and thematic
    differences between available silver standard corpora. Additionally, available
    training and target data differs with regard to their domain (professional summaries
    vs. sentences in abstracts). This makes supervised machine learning inapplicable.
    We propose the use of two semi-supervised machine learning approaches: To mitigate
    difficulties arising from heterogeneous data sources, overcome data imbalance
    and create reliable training data we propose using transductive learning from
    positive and unlabelled data (PU Learning). For obtaining a realistic classification
    model, we propose the use of abstracts summarised in relevant sentences as unlabelled
    examples through Self-Training. The best model achieves 84% accuracy and 0.84
    F1 score on our dataset'

  abstract: Ontology alignment is the task of identifying semantically equivalent
    entities from two given ontologies. Different ontologies have different representations
    of the same entity, resulting in a need to de-duplicate entities when merging
    ontologies. We propose a method for enriching entities in an ontology with external
    definition and context information, and use this additional information for ontology
    alignment. We develop a neural architecture capable of encoding the additional
    information when available, and show that the addition of external data results
    in an F1-score of 0.69 on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)
    largebio SNOMED-NCI subtask, comparable with the entity-level matchers in a SOTA
    system.

  abstract: Word2vec embeddings are limited to computing vectors for in-vocabulary
    terms and do not take into account sub-word information. Character-based representations,
    such as fastText, mitigate such limitations. We optimize and compare these representations
    for the biomedical domain. fastText was found to consistently outperform word2vec
    in named entity recognition tasks for entities such as chemicals and genes. This
    is likely due to gained information from computed out-of-vocabulary term vectors,
    as well as the word compositionality of such entities. Contrastingly, performance
    varied on intrinsic datasets. Optimal hyper-parameters were intrinsic dataset-dependent,
    likely due to differences in term types distributions. This indicates embeddings
    should be chosen based on the task at hand. We therefore provide a number of optimized
    hyper-parameter sets and pre-trained word2vec and fastText models, available on
    https://github.com/dterg/bionlp-embed.

  abstract: 'Successful evidence-based medicine (EBM) applications rely on answering
    clinical questions by analyzing large medical literature databases. In order to
    formulate a well-defined, focused clinical question, a framework called PICO is
    widely used, which identifies the sentences in a given medical text that belong
    to the four components: Participants/Problem (P), Intervention (I), Comparison
    (C) and Outcome (O). In this work, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    neural network based model to automatically detect PICO elements. By jointly classifying
    subsequent sentences in the given text, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
    PICO element classification compared to several strong baseline models. We also
    make our curated data public as a benchmarking dataset so that the community can
    benefit from it.'

  abstract: This paper describes the COSTA scheme for coding structures and actions
    in conversation. Informed by Conversation Analysis, the scheme introduces an innovative
    method for marking multi-layer structural organization of conversation and a structure-informed
    taxonomy of actions. In addition, we create a corpus of naturally occurring medical
    conversations, containing 318 video-recorded and manually transcribed pediatric
    consultations. Based on the annotated corpus, we investigate 1) treatment decision-making
    process in medical conversations, and 2) effects of physician-caregiver communication
    behaviors on antibiotic over-prescribing. Although the COSTA annotation scheme
    is developed based on data from the task-specific domain of pediatric consultations,
    it can be easily extended to apply to more general domains and other languages.

  abstract: In this study, we investigate learning-to-rank and query refinement approaches
    for information retrieval in the pharmacogenomic domain. The goal is to improve
    the information retrieval process of biomedical curators, who manually build knowledge
    bases for personalized medicine. We study how to exploit the relationships between
    genes, variants, drugs, diseases and outcomes as features for document ranking
    and query refinement. For a supervised approach, we are faced with a small amount
    of annotated data and a large amount of unannotated data. Therefore, we explore
    ways to use a neural document auto-encoder in a semi-supervised approach. We show
    that a combination of established algorithms, feature-engineering and a neural
    auto-encoder model yield promising results in this setting.

  abstract: Event and relation extraction are central tasks in biomedical text mining.
    Where relation extraction concerns the detection of semantic connections between
    pairs of entities, event extraction expands this concept with the addition of
    trigger words, multiple arguments and nested events, in order to more accurately
    model the diversity of natural language. In this work we develop a convolutional
    neural network that can be used for both event and relation extraction. We use
    a linear representation of the input text, where information is encoded with various
    vector space embeddings. Most notably, we encode the parse graph into this linear
    space using dependency path embeddings. We integrate our neural network into the
    open source Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) framework. Using this system,
    our machine learning model can be easily applied to a large set of corpora from
    e.g. the BioNLP, DDI Extraction and BioCreative shared tasks. We evaluate our
    system on 12 different event, relation and NER corpora, showing good generalizability
    to many tasks and achieving improved performance on several corpora.

    \ the document to be tagged as a query into the GLM to retrieve candidate phrases\
    \ from top-ranked related documents, thus associating every document with novel\
    \ related concepts extracted from the text. For this we extend the word embedding-based\

    \ and use the semantic tags thus obtained for downstream query expansion, both\
    \ directly and in feedback loop settings. Our method, evaluated using the TREC\

    obtaining state-of-the-art result relative to previous neural approaches.

  abstract: With the development of medical information management, numerous medical
    data are being classified, indexed, and searched in various systems. Disease phrase
    matching, i.e., deciding whether two given disease phrases interpret each other,
    is a basic but crucial preprocessing step for the above tasks. Being capable of
    relieving the scarceness of annotations, domain adaptation is generally considered
    useful in medical systems. However, efforts on applying it to phrase matching
    remain limited. This paper presents a domain-adaptive matching network for disease
    phrases. Our network achieves domain adaptation by adversarial training, i.e.,
    preferring features indicating whether the two phrases match, rather than which
    domain they come from. Experiments suggest that our model has the best performance
    among the very few non-adaptive or adaptive methods that can benefit from out-of-domain
    annotations.

  abstract: Overcrowding in emergency rooms is a major challenge faced by hospitals
    across the United States. Overcrowding can result in longer wait times, which,
    in turn, has been shown to adversely affect patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes,
    and procedure reimbursements. This paper presents research that aims to automatically
    predict discharge disposition of patients who received medical treatment in an
    emergency department. We make use of a corpus that consists of notes containing
    patient complaints, diagnosis information, and disposition, entered by health
    care providers. We use this corpus to develop a model that uses the complaint
    and diagnosis information to predict patient disposition. We show that the proposed
    model substantially outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common disposition
    type. The long-term goal of this research is to build a model that can be implemented
    as a real-time service in an application to predict disposition as patients arrive.

  abstract: Automatic recognition of biomedical entities in text is the crucial initial
    step in biomedical text mining. In this pa-per, we investigate employing modern
    neural network models for recognizing biomedical entities. To compensate for the
    small amount of training data in biomedical domain, we propose to integrate dictionaries
    into the neural model. Our experiments on BB3 data sets demonstrate that state-of-the-art
    neural network model is promising in recognizing biomedical entities even with
    very little training data. When integrated with dictionaries, its performance
    could be greatly improved, achieving the competitive performance compared with
    the best dictionary-based system on the entities with specific terminology, and
    much higher performance on the entities with more general terminology.

  abstract: We investigate the quality of task specific word embeddings created with
    relatively small, targeted corpora. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework
    including both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation that can be expanded to named
    entities beyond drug name. Intrinsic evaluation results tell that drug name embeddings
    created with a domain specific document corpus outperformed the previously published
    versions that derived from a very large general text corpus. Extrinsic evaluation
    uses word embedding for the task of drug name recognition with Bi-LSTM model and
    the results demonstrate the advantage of using domain-specific word embeddings
    as the only input feature for drug name recognition with F1-score achieving 0.91.
    This work suggests that it may be advantageous to derive domain specific embeddings
    for certain tasks even when the domain specific corpus is of limited size.

  abstract: Creating simulated search environments has been of a significant interest
    in infor-mation retrieval, in both general and bio-medical search domains. Existing
    collec-tions include modest number of queries and are constructed by manually
    evaluat-ing retrieval results. In this work we pro-pose leveraging MeSH term assignments
    for creating synthetic test beds. We select a suitable subset of MeSH terms as
    queries, and utilize MeSH term assignments as pseudo-relevance rankings for retrieval
    evaluation. Using well studied retrieval functions, we show that their performance
    on the proposed data is consistent with similar findings in previous work. We
    further use the proposed retrieval evaluation framework to better understand how
    to combine heterogeneous sources of textual information.

  abstract: Sequence labeling of biomedical entities, e.g., side effects or phenotypes,
    was a long-term task in BioNLP and MedNLP communities. Thanks to effects made
    among these communities, adverse reaction NER has developed dramatically in recent
    years. As an illuminative application, to achieve knowledge discovery via the
    combination of the text mining result and bioinformatics idea shed lights on the

  abstract: This study focuses on highly accurate prediction of the onset of type-2
    diabetes. We investigated whether prediction accuracy can be improved by utilizing
    lab test data obtained from health checkups and incorporating health claim text
    data such as medically diagnosed diseases with ICD10 codes and pharmacy information.
    In a previous study, prediction accuracy was increased slightly by adding diagnosis
    disease name and independent variables such as prescription medicine. Therefore,
    in the current study we explored more suitable models for prediction by using
    state-of-the-art techniques such as XGBoost and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    based on recurrent neural networks. In the current study, text data was vectorized
    using word2vec, and the prediction model was compared with logistic regression.
    The results obtained confirmed that onset of type-2 diabetes can be predicted
    with a high degree of accuracy when the XGBoost model is used.

  abstract: High quality word embeddings are of great significance to advance applications
    of biomedical natural language processing. In recent years, a surge of interest
    on how to learn good embeddings and evaluate embedding quality based on English
    medical text has become increasing evident, however a limited number of studies
    based on Chinese medical text, particularly Chinese clinical records, were performed.
    Herein, we proposed a novel approach of improving the quality of learned embeddings
    using out-domain data as a supplementary in the case of limited Chinese clinical
    records. Moreover, the embedding quality evaluation method was conducted based
    on Medical Conceptual Similarity Property. The experimental results revealed that
    selecting good training samples was necessary, and collecting right amount of
    out-domain data and trading off between the quality of embeddings and the training
    time consumption were essential factors for better embeddings.

  abstract: Existing biomedical coreference resolution systems depend on features
    and/or rules based on syntactic parsers. In this paper, we investigate the utility
    of the state-of-the-art general domain neural coreference resolution system on
    biomedical texts. The system is an end-to-end system without depending on any
    syntactic parsers. We also investigate the domain specific features to enhance
    the system for biomedical texts. Experimental results on the BioNLP Protein Coreference
    dataset and the CRAFT corpus show that, with no parser information, the adapted
    system compared favorably with the systems that depend on parser information on
    these datasets, achieving 51.23% on the BioNLP dataset and 36.33% on the CRAFT
    corpus in F1 score. In-domain embeddings and domain-specific features helped improve
    the performance on the BioNLP dataset, but they did not on the CRAFT corpus.

    \ concept of adherence with a focus on the patient\u2019s affect, lifestyle choices,\
    \ and health goal status. We describe an engagement annotation task across two\
    \ patient note domains: traditional clinical notes and a novel domain, care manager\
    \ notes, where we find engagement to be more common. The annotation task resulted\
    \ in a kappa of .53, suggesting strong annotator intuitions regarding engagement-bearing\

  abstract: This paper presents a method of designing specific high-order dependency
    factor on the linear chain conditional random fields (CRFs) for named entity recognition
    (NER). Named entities tend to be separated from each other by multiple outside
    tokens in a text, and thus the first-order CRF, as well as the second-order CRF,
    may innately lose transition information between distant named entities. The proposed
    design uses outside label in NER as a transmission medium of precedent entity
    information on the CRF. Then, empirical results apparently demonstrate that it
    is possible to exploit long-distance label dependency in the original first-order
    linear chain CRF structure upon NER while reducing computational loss rather than
    in the second-order CRF.

  abstract: Recent collective Entity Linking studies usually promote global coherence
    of all the mapped entities in the same document by using semantic embeddings and
    graph-based approaches. Although graph-based approaches are shown to achieve remarkable
    results, they are computationally expensive for general datasets. Also, semantic
    embeddings only indicate relatedness between entity pairs without considering
    sequences. In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a two-fold
    neural model. First, we match easy mention-entity pairs and using the domain information
    of this pair to filter candidate entities of closer mentions. Second, we resolve
    more ambiguous pairs using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and CRF models
    for the entity disambiguation. Our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art
    systems on the generated domain-specific evaluation dataset.

  abstract: The problem of sequence labelling in language understanding would benefit
    from approaches inspired by semantic priming phenomena. We propose that an attention-based
    RNN architecture can be used to simulate semantic priming for sequence labelling.
    Specifically, we employ pre-trained word embeddings to characterize the semantic
    relationship between utterances and labels. We validate the approach using varying
    sizes of the ATIS and MEDIA datasets, and show up to 1.4-1.9% improvement in F1
    score. The developed framework can enable more explainable and generalizable spoken
    language understanding systems.

  abstract: "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a major task in the field of Natural\
    \ Language Processing (NLP), and also is a sub-task of Information Extraction.\
    \ The challenge of NER for tweets lie in the insufficient information available\
    \ in a tweet. There has been a significant amount of work done related to entity\
    \ extraction, but only for resource rich languages and domains such as newswire.\
    \ Entity extraction is, in general, a challenging task for such an informal text,\
    \ and code-mixed text further complicates the process with it\u2019s unstructured\
    \ and incomplete information. We propose experiments with different machine learning\
    \ classification algorithms with word, character and lexical features. The algorithms\
    \ we experimented with are Decision tree, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Conditional\
    \ Random Field (CRF). In this paper, we present a corpus for NER in Hindi-English\
    \ Code-Mixed along with extensive experiments on our machine learning models which\
    \ achieved the best f1-score of 0.95 with both CRF and LSTM."

  abstract: Proper names of organisations are a special case of collective nouns.
    Their meaning can be conceptualised as a collective unit or as a plurality of
    persons, allowing for different morphological marking of coreferent anaphoric
    pronouns. This paper explores the variability of references to organisation names
    with 1) a corpus analysis and 2) two crowd-sourced story continuation experiments.
    The first shows that the preference for singular vs. plural conceptualisation
    is dependent on the level of formality of a text. In the second, we observe a
    strong preference for the plural they otherwise typical of informal speech. Using
    edited corpus data instead of constructed sentences as stimuli reduces this preference.

  abstract: Customized translation need pay spe-cial attention to the target domain
    ter-minology especially the named-entities for the domain. Adding linguistic features
    to neural machine translation (NMT) has been shown to benefit translation in many
    studies. In this paper, we further demonstrate that adding named-entity (NE) feature
    with named-entity recognition (NER) into the source language produces better translation
    with NMT. Our experiments show that by just including the different NE classes
    and boundary tags, we can increase the BLEU score by around 1 to 2 points using
    the standard test sets from WMT2017. We also show that adding NE tags using NER
    and applying in-domain adaptation can be combined to further improve customized
    machine translation.

  abstract: Transliteration is defined as phonetic translation of names across languages.
    Transliteration of Named Entities (NEs) is necessary in many applications, such
    as machine translation, corpus alignment, cross-language IR, information extraction
    and automatic lexicon acquisition. All such systems call for high-performance
    transliteration, which is the focus of shared task in the NEWS 2018 workshop.
    The objective of the shared task is to promote machine transliteration research
    by providing a common benchmarking platform for the community to evaluate the
    state-of-the-art technologies.

  abstract: This report presents the results from the Named Entity Transliteration
    Shared Task conducted as part of The Seventh Named Entities Workshop (NEWS 2018)
    held at ACL 2018 in Melbourne, Australia. Similar to previous editions of NEWS,
    the Shared Task featured 19 tasks on proper name transliteration, including 13
    different languages and two different Japanese scripts. A total of 6 teams from
    8 different institutions participated in the evaluation, submitting 424 runs,
    involving different transliteration methodologies. Four performance metrics were
    used to report the evaluation results. The NEWS shared task on machine transliteration
    has successfully achieved its objectives by providing a common ground for the
    research community to conduct comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art technologies
    that will benefit the future research and development in this area.

  abstract: This paper reports the results of our trans-literation experiments conducted
    on NEWS 2018 Shared Task dataset. We focus on creating the baseline systems trained
    using two open-source, statistical transliteration tools, namely Sequitur and
    Moses. We discuss the pre-processing steps performed on this dataset for both
    the systems. We also provide a re-ranking system which uses top hypotheses from
    Sequitur and Moses to create a consolidated list of transliterations. The results
    obtained from each of these models can be used to present a good starting point
    for the participating teams.

  abstract: Transliterating named entities from one language into another can be approached
    as neural machine translation (NMT) problem, for which we use deep attentional
    RNN encoder-decoder models. To build a strong transliteration system, we apply
    well-established techniques from NMT, such as dropout regularization, model ensembling,
    rescoring with right-to-left models, and back-translation. Our submission to the
    NEWS 2018 Shared Task on Named Entity Transliteration ranked first in several
    tracks.

  abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme models are key components in automatic speech recognition
    and text-to-speech systems. With low-resource language pairs that do not have
    available and well-developed pronunciation lexicons, grapheme-to-phoneme models
    are particularly useful. These models are based on initial alignments between
    grapheme source and phoneme target sequences. Inspired by sequence-to-sequence
    recurrent neural network-based translation methods, the current research presents
    an approach that applies an alignment representation for input sequences and pre-trained
    source and target embeddings to overcome the transliteration problem for a low-resource
    languages pair. We participated in the NEWS 2018 shared task for the English-Vietnamese
    transliteration task.

W18-2501:
  abstract: Modern natural language processing (NLP) research requires writing code.
    Ideally this code would provide a precise definition of the approach, easy repeatability
    of results, and a basis for extending the research. However, many research codebases
    bury high-level parameters under implementation details, are challenging to run
    and debug, and are difficult enough to extend that they are more likely to be
    rewritten. This paper describes AllenNLP, a library for applying deep learning
    methods to NLP research that addresses these issues with easy-to-use command-line
    tools, declarative configuration-driven experiments, and modular NLP abstractions.
    AllenNLP has already increased the rate of research experimentation and the sharing
    of NLP components at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and we are
    working to have the same impact across the field.

  abstract: "Open-source software packages for language processing often include stop\
    \ word lists. Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions\
    \ (e.g. \u201Chasn\u2019t\u201D but not \u201Chadn\u2019t\u201D) and inclusions\
    \ (\u201Ccomputer\u201D), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer.\
    \ Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate\
    \ variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists,\
    \ and propose strategies for mitigating these issues."

  abstract: We introduce Texar, an open-source toolkit aiming to support the broad
    set of text generation tasks. Different from many existing toolkits that are specialized
    for specific applications (e.g., neural machine translation), Texar is designed
    to be highly flexible and versatile. This is achieved by abstracting the common
    patterns underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creating a library of
    highly reusable modules and functionalities, and enabling arbitrary model architectures
    and various algorithmic paradigms. The features make Texar particularly suitable
    for technique sharing and generalization across different text generation applications.
    The toolkit emphasizes heavily on extensibility and modularized system design,
    so that components can be freely plugged in or swapped out. We conduct extensive
    experiments and case studies to demonstrate the use and advantage of the toolkit.

    \ maintained exclusively by community volunteers and has to be available and up-to-date\

    \ this, and then discuss how the planned use of Docker images will improve the\

  abstract: UKB is an open source collection of programs for performing, among other
    tasks, Knowledge-Based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Since it was released
    in 2009 it has been often used out-of-the-box in sub-optimal settings. We show
    that nine years later it is the state-of-the-art on knowledge-based WSD. This
    case shows the pitfalls of releasing open source NLP software without optimal
    default settings and precise instructions for reproducibility.

  abstract: The open-source SUMMA Platform is a highly scalable distributed architecture
    for monitoring a large number of media broadcasts in parallel, with a lag behind
    actual broadcast time of at most a few minutes. It assembles numerous state-of-the-art
    NLP technologies into a fully automated media ingestion pipeline that can record
    live broadcasts, detect and transcribe spoken content, translate from several
    languages (original text or transcribed speech) into English, recognize Named
    Entities, detect topics, cluster and summarize documents across language barriers,
    and extract and store factual claims in these news items. This paper describes
    the intended use cases and discusses the system design decisions that allowed
    us to integrate state-of-the-art NLP modules into an effective workflow with comparatively
    little effort.

  abstract: (Note this is not being submitted blind. The chair of the workshop requested
    this submission unblinded from me on twitter, so assuming that is okay.) A major
    goal of open-source NLP is to quickly and accurately reproduce the results of
    new work, in a manner that the community can easily use and modify. While most
    papers publish enough detail for replication, it still may be difficult to achieve
    good results in practice. This paper presents a worked exercise of paper reproduction
    with the goal of implementing the results of the recent Transformer model. The
    replication exercise aims at simple code structure that follows closely with the
    original work, while achieving an efficient usable system.

  abstract: To answer the question in machine comprehension (MC) task, the models
    need to establish the interaction between the question and the context. To tackle
    the problem that the single-pass model cannot reflect on and correct its answer,
    we present Ruminating Reader. Ruminating Reader adds a second pass of attention
    and a novel information fusion component to the Bi-Directional Attention Flow
    model (BiDAF). We propose novel layer structures that construct a query aware
    context vector representation and fuse encoding representation with intermediate
    representation on top of BiDAF model. We show that a multi-hop attention mechanism
    can be applied to a bi-directional attention structure. In experiments on SQuAD,
    we find that the Reader outperforms the BiDAF baseline by 2.1 F1 score and 2.7
    EM score. Our analysis shows that different hops of the attention have different
    responsibilities in selecting answers.

  abstract: "We analyzed the outputs of multiple question answering (QA) models applied\
    \ to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) to identify the core challenges\
    \ for QA systems on this data set. Through an iterative process, challenging aspects\
    \ were hypothesized through qualitative analysis of the common error cases. A\
    \ classifier was then constructed to predict whether SQuAD test examples were\
    \ likely to be difficult for systems to answer based on features associated with\
    \ the hypothesized aspects. The classifier\u2019s performance was used to accept\
    \ or reject each aspect as an indicator of difficulty. With this approach, we\
    \ ensured that our hypotheses were systematically tested and not simply accepted\
    \ based on our pre-existing biases. Our explanations are not accepted based on\
    \ human evaluation of individual examples. This process also enabled us to identify\
    \ the primary QA strategy learned by the models, i.e., systems determined the\
    \ acceptable answer type for a question and then selected the acceptable answer\
    \ span of that type containing the highest density of words present in the question\
    \ within its local vicinity in the passage."

  abstract: Reading Comprehension (RC) of text is one of the fundamental tasks in
    natural language processing. In recent years, several end-to-end neural network
    models have been proposed to solve RC tasks. However, most of these models suffer
    in reasoning over long documents. In this work, we propose a novel Memory Augmented
    Machine Comprehension Network (MAMCN) to address long-range dependencies present
    in machine reading comprehension. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate
    proposed method with the renowned benchmark datasets such as SQuAD, QUASAR-T,
    and TriviaQA. We achieve the state of the art performance on both the document-level
    (QUASAR-T, TriviaQA) and paragraph-level (SQuAD) datasets compared to all the
    previously published approaches.

  abstract: Question answering systems deteriorate dramatically in the presence of
    adversarial sentences in articles. According to Jia and Liang (2017), the single
    BiDAF system (Seo et al., 2016) only achieves an F1 score of 4.8 on the ADDANY
    adversarial dataset. In this paper, we present a method to tackle this problem
    via answer sentence selection. Given a paragraph of an article and a corresponding
    query, instead of directly feeding the whole paragraph to the single BiDAF system,
    a sentence that most likely contains the answer to the query is first selected,
    which is done via a deep neural network based on TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015).
    Experiments on ADDANY adversarial dataset validate the effectiveness of our method.
    The F1 score has been improved to 52.3.

  abstract: 'This paper introduces DuReader, a new large-scale, open-domain Chinese
    machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset, designed to address real-world MRC.
    DuReader has three advantages over previous MRC datasets: (1) data sources: questions
    and documents are based on Baidu Search and Baidu Zhidao; answers are manually
    generated. (2) question types: it provides rich annotations for more question
    types, especially yes-no and opinion questions, that leaves more opportunity for
    the research community. (3) scale: it contains 200K questions, 420K answers and
    1M documents; it is the largest Chinese MRC dataset so far. Experiments show that
    human performance is well above current state-of-the-art baseline systems, leaving
    plenty of room for the community to make improvements. To help the community make
    these improvements, both DuReader and baseline systems have been posted online.
    We also organize a shared competition to encourage the exploration of more models.
    Since the release of the task, there are significant improvements over the baselines.'

  abstract: Deep learning models are often not easily adaptable to new tasks and require
    task-specific adjustments. The differentiable neural computer (DNC), a memory-augmented
    neural network, is designed as a general problem solver which can be used in a
    wide range of tasks. But in reality, it is hard to apply this model to new tasks.
    We analyze the DNC and identify possible improvements within the application of
    question answering. This motivates a more robust and scalable DNC (rsDNC). The
    objective precondition is to keep the general character of this model intact while
    making its application more reliable and speeding up its required training time.
    The rsDNC is distinguished by a more robust training, a slim memory unit and a
    bidirectional architecture. We not only achieve new state-of-the-art performance
    on the bAbI task, but also minimize the performance variance between different
    initializations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the simplified applicability of the
    rsDNC to new tasks with passable results on the CNN RC task without adaptions.

  abstract: The recent work of Clark et al. (2018) introduces the AI2 Reasoning Challenge
    (ARC) and the associated ARC dataset that partitions open domain, complex science
    questions into easy and challenge sets. That paper includes an analysis of 100
    questions with respect to the types of knowledge and reasoning required to answer
    them; however, it does not include clear definitions of these types, nor does
    it offer information about the quality of the labels. We propose a comprehensive
    set of definitions of knowledge and reasoning types necessary for answering the
    questions in the ARC dataset. Using ten annotators and a sophisticated annotation
    interface, we analyze the distribution of labels across the challenge set and
    statistics related to them. Additionally, we demonstrate that although naive information
    retrieval methods return sentences that are irrelevant to answering the query,
    sufficient supporting text is often present in the (ARC) corpus. Evaluating with
    human-selected relevant sentences improves the performance of a neural machine
    comprehension model by 42 points.

  abstract: We describe our experiences in using an open domain question answering
    model (Chen et al., 2017) to evaluate an out-of-domain QA task of assisting in
    analyzing privacy policies of companies. Specifically, Relevant CI Parameters
    Extractor (RECIPE) seeks to answer questions posed by the theory of contextual
    integrity (CI) regarding the information flows described in the privacy statements.
    These questions have a simple syntactic structure and the answers are factoids
    or descriptive in nature. The model achieved an F1 score of 72.33, but we noticed
    that combining the results of this model with a neural dependency parser based
    approach yields a significantly higher F1 score of 92.35 compared to manual annotations.
    This indicates that future work which in-corporates signals from parsing like
    NLP tasks more explicitly can generalize better on out-of-domain tasks.

  abstract: We propose a two-stage neural model to tackle question generation from
    documents. First, our model estimates the probability that word sequences in a
    document are ones that a human would pick when selecting candidate answers by
    training a neural key-phrase extractor on the answers in a question-answering
    corpus. Predicted key phrases then act as target answers and condition a sequence-to-sequence
    question-generation model with a copy mechanism. Empirically, our key-phrase extraction
    model significantly outperforms an entity-tagging baseline and existing rule-based
    approaches. We further demonstrate that our question generation system formulates
    fluent, answerable questions from key phrases. This two-stage system could be
    used to augment or generate reading comprehension datasets, which may be leveraged
    to improve machine reading systems or in educational settings.

  abstract: The task of Question Answering has gained prominence in the past few decades
    for testing the ability of machines to understand natural language. Large datasets
    for Machine Reading have led to the development of neural models that cater to
    deeper language understanding compared to information retrieval tasks. Different
    components in these neural architectures are intended to tackle different challenges.
    As a first step towards achieving generalization across multiple domains, we attempt
    to understand and compare the peculiarities of existing end-to-end neural models
    on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) by performing quantitative
    as well as qualitative analysis of the results attained by each of them. We observed
    that prediction errors reflect certain model-specific biases, which we further
    discuss in this paper.

  abstract: Current evaluation metrics to question answering based machine reading
    comprehension (MRC) systems generally focus on the lexical overlap between candidate
    and reference answers, such as ROUGE and BLEU. However, bias may appear when these
    metrics are used for specific question types, especially questions inquiring yes-no
    opinions and entity lists. In this paper, we make adaptations on the metrics to
    better correlate n-gram overlap with the human judgment for answers to these two
    question types. Statistical analysis proves the effectiveness of our approach.
    Our adaptations may provide positive guidance for the development of real-scene
    MRC systems.-gram overlap with the human judgment for answers to these two question

  abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) systems aim to correct the systematic errors
    made by machine translators. In this paper, we propose a neural APE system that
    encodes the source (src) and machine translated (mt) sentences with two separate
    encoders, but leverages a shared attention mechanism to better understand how
    the two inputs contribute to the generation of the post-edited (pe) sentences.
    Our empirical observations have showed that when the mt is incorrect, the attention
    shifts weight toward tokens in the src sentence to properly edit the incorrect
    translation. The model has been trained and evaluated on the official data from
    the WMT16 and WMT17 APE IT domain English-German shared tasks. Additionally, we
    have used the extra 500K artificial data provided by the shared task. Our system
    has been able to reproduce the accuracies of systems trained with the same data,
    while at the same time providing better interpretability.

  abstract: Machine translation systems require semantic knowledge and grammatical
    understanding. Neural machine translation (NMT) systems often assume this information
    is captured by an attention mechanism and a decoder that ensures fluency. Recent
    work has shown that incorporating explicit syntax alleviates the burden of modeling
    both types of knowledge. However, requiring parses is expensive and does not explore
    the question of what syntax a model needs during translation. To address both
    of these issues we introduce a model that simultaneously translates while inducing
    dependency trees. In this way, we leverage the benefits of structure while investigating
    what syntax NMT must induce to maximize performance. We show that our dependency
    trees are 1. language pair dependent and 2. improve translation quality.

    \ for neural machine translation (NMT). Standard practice is to train a generic\

    \ to the training objective during continued training that minimizes the cross\

    \ of the out-of-domain model to prevent the model\u2019s output from differing\
    \ too much from the original out-of-domain model. We perform experiments on EMEA\
    \ (descriptions of medicines) and TED (rehearsed presentations), initialized from\
    \ a general domain (WMT) model. Our method shows improvements over standard continued\
    \ training by up to 1.5 BLEU."

  abstract: A large-scale parallel corpus is required to train encoder-decoder neural
    machine translation. The method of using synthetic parallel texts, in which target
    monolingual corpora are automatically translated into source sentences, is effective
    in improving the decoder, but is unreliable for enhancing the encoder. In this
    paper, we propose a method that enhances the encoder and attention using target
    monolingual corpora by generating multiple source sentences via sampling. By using
    multiple source sentences, diversity close to that of humans is achieved. Our
    experimental results show that the translation quality is improved by increasing
    the number of synthetic source sentences for each given target sentence, and quality
    close to that using a manually created parallel corpus was achieved.

  abstract: "It is common practice to adapt machine translation systems to novel domains,\
    \ but even a well-adapted system may be able to perform better on a particular\
    \ document if it were to learn from a translator\u2019s corrections within the\
    \ document itself. We focus on adaptation within a single document \u2013 appropriate\
    \ for an interactive translation scenario where a model adapts to a human translator\u2019\
    s input over the course of a document. We propose two methods: single-sentence\
    \ adaptation (which performs online adaptation one sentence at a time) and dictionary\
    \ adaptation (which specifically addresses the issue of translating novel words).\
    \ Combining the two models results in improvements over both approaches individually,\
    \ and over baseline systems, even on short documents. On WMT news test data, we\
    \ observe an improvement of +1.8 BLEU points and +23.3% novel word translation\

  abstract: We examine how various types of noise in the parallel training data impact
    the quality of neural machine translation systems. We create five types of artificial
    noise and analyze how they degrade performance in neural and statistical machine
    translation. We find that neural models are generally more harmed by noise than
    statistical models. For one especially egregious type of noise they learn to just
    copy the input sentence.

  abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-resource settings, Neural Machine
    Translation (NMT) still struggles in low-resource and out-of-domain scenarios,
    often failing to match the quality of phrase-based translation. We propose a novel
    technique that combines back-translation and multilingual NMT to improve performance
    in these difficult cases. Our technique trains a single model for both directions
    of a language pair, allowing us to back-translate source or target monolingual
    data without requiring an auxiliary model. We then continue training on the augmented
    parallel data, enabling a cycle of improvement for a single model that can incorporate
    any source, target, or parallel data to improve both translation directions. As
    a byproduct, these models can reduce training and deployment costs significantly
    compared to uni-directional models. Extensive experiments show that our technique
    outperforms standard back-translation in low-resource scenarios, improves quality
    on cross-domain tasks, and effectively reduces costs across the board.

  abstract: Multi-source translation is an approach to exploit multiple inputs (e.g.
    in two different languages) to increase translation accuracy. In this paper, we
    examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) using an
    incomplete multilingual corpus in which some translations are missing. In practice,
    many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations
    in all of the relevant languages (for example, in TED talks, most English talks
    only have subtitles for a small portion of the languages that TED supports). Existing
    studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations.
    This study focuses on the use of incomplete multilingual corpora in multi-encoder
    NMT and mixture of NMT experts and examines a very simple implementation where
    missing source translations are replaced by a special symbol <NULL>. These methods
    allow us to use incomplete corpora both at training time and test time. In experiments
    with real incomplete multilingual corpora of TED Talks, the multi-source NMT with
    the <NULL> tokens achieved higher translation accuracies measured by BLEU than
    those by any one-to-one NMT systems.

  abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the quality
    of automatic translation models. One of the main challenges in current systems
    is the translation of rare words. We present a generic approach to address this
    weakness by having external models annotate the training data as Experts, and
    control the model-expert interaction with a pointer network and reinforcement
    learning. Our experiments using phrase-based models to simulate Experts to complement
    neural machine translation models show that the model can be trained to copy the
    annotations into the output consistently. We demonstrate the benefit of our proposed
    framework in outof domain translation scenarios with only lexical resources, improving
    more than 1.0 BLEU point in both translation directions English-Spanish and German-English.

  abstract: This paper describes the NICT neural machine translation system submitted
    at the NMT-2018 shared task. A characteristic of our approach is the introduction
    of self-training. Since our self-training does not change the model structure,
    it does not influence the efficiency of translation, such as the translation speed.
    The experimental results showed that the translation quality improved not only
    in the sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) models but also in the transformer models.

    University of Edinburgh, Adam Mickiewicz University, Tilde and University of Alicante.
    We focus on efficient implementation of the recurrent deep-learning model as implemented
    in Amun, the fast inference engine for neural machine translation. We improve
    the performance with an efficient mini-batching algorithm, and by fusing the softmax
    operation with the k-best extraction algorithm. Submissions using Amun were first,
    second and third fastest in the GPU efficiency track.

  abstract: 'We present a system description of the OpenNMT Neural Machine Translation
    entry for the WNMT 2018 evaluation. In this work, we developed a heavily optimized
    NMT inference model targeting a high-performance CPU system. The final system
    uses a combination of four techniques, all of them lead to significant speed-ups
    in combination: (a) sequence distillation, (b) architecture modifications, (c)
    precomputation, particularly of vocabulary, and (d) CPU targeted quantization.
    This work achieves the fastest performance of the shared task, and led to the
    development of new features that have been integrated to OpenNMT and available
    to the community.'

  abstract: The task of taking a semantic representation of a noun and predicting
    the brain activity triggered by it in terms of fMRI spatial patterns was pioneered
    by Mitchell et al. 2008. That seminal work used word co-occurrence features to
    represent the meaning of the nouns. Even though the task does not impose any specific
    type of semantic representation, the vast majority of subsequent approaches resort
    to feature-based models or to semantic spaces (aka word embeddings). We address
    this task, with competitive results, by using instead a semantic network to encode
    lexical semantics, thus providing further evidence for the cognitive plausibility
    of this approach to model lexical meaning.

  abstract: We present an analysis of the internal mechanism of the recurrent neural
    model of sentence production presented by Calvillo et al. (2016). The results
    show clear patterns of computation related to each layer in the network allowing
    to infer an algorithmic account, where the semantics activates the semantically
    related words, then each word generated at each time step activates syntactic
    and semantic constraints on possible continuations, while the recurrence preserves
    information through time. We propose that such insights could generalize to other
    models with similar architecture, including some used in computational linguistics
    for language modeling, machine translation and image caption generation.

  abstract: "In recent years, a variety of recurrent neural networks have been proposed,\
    \ e.g LSTM. However, existing models only read the text once, it cannot describe\
    \ the situation of repeated reading in reading comprehension. In fact, when reading\
    \ or analyzing a text, we may read the text several times rather than once if\
    \ we couldn\u2019t well understand it. So, how to model this kind of the reading\
    \ behavior? To address the issue, we propose a multi-glance mechanism (MGM) for\
    \ modeling the habit of reading behavior. In the proposed framework, the actual\
    \ reading process can be fully simulated, and then the obtained information can\
    \ be consistent with the task. Based on the multi-glance mechanism, we design\
    \ two types of recurrent neural network models for repeated reading: Glance Cell\
    \ Model (GCM) and Glance Gate Model (GGM). Visualization analysis of the GCM and\
    \ the GGM demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-glance mechanisms. Experiments\
    \ results on the large-scale datasets show that the proposed methods can achieve\
    \ better performance."

  abstract: "We present two methods that improve the assessment of cognitive models.\
    \ The first method is applicable to models computing average acceptability ratings.\
    \ For these models, we propose an extension that simulates a full rating distribution\
    \ (instead of average ratings) and allows generating individual ratings. Our second\
    \ method enables Bayesian inference for models generating individual data. To\
    \ this end, we propose to use the cross-match test (Rosenbaum, 2005) as a likelihood\
    \ function. We exemplarily present both methods using cognitive models from the\
    \ domain of spatial language use. For spatial language use, determining linguistic\
    \ acceptability judgments of a spatial preposition for a depicted spatial relation\
    \ is assumed to be a crucial process (Logan and Sadler, 1996). Existing models\
    \ of this process compute an average acceptability rating. We extend the models\
    \ and \u2013 based on existing data \u2013 show that the extended models allow\
    \ extracting more information from the empirical data and yield more readily interpretable\
    \ information about model successes and failures. Applying Bayesian inference,\
    \ we find that model performance relies less on mechanisms of capturing geometrical\
    \ aspects than on mapping the captured geometry to a rating interval."

  abstract: This paper presents a left-corner parser for minimalist grammars. The
    relation between the parser and the grammar is transparent in the sense that there
    is a very simple 1-1 correspondence between derivations and parses. Like left-corner
    context-free parsers, left-corner minimalist parsers can be non-terminating when
    the grammar has empty left corners, so an easily computed left-corner oracle is
    defined to restrict the search.

    \ which treat morphemes uniformly, making no distinction between stem and affix.\
    \ We run this new architecture on a dependency parsing task in Korean\u2014a language\
    \ rich in derivational morphology\u2014and compare it against a lexical baseline,along\
    \ with other sub-word architectures. StAffNet, the name of our architecture, shows\

  abstract: Incorporating source syntactic information into neural machine translation
    (NMT) has recently proven successful (Eriguchi et al., 2016; Luong et al., 2016).
    However, this is generally done using an outside parser to syntactically annotate
    the training data, making this technique difficult to use for languages or domains
    for which a reliable parser is not available. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
    tree-to-sequence (tree2seq) model for neural machine translation; this model is
    able to induce an unsupervised hierarchical structure on the source sentence based
    on the downstream task of neural machine translation. We adapt the Gumbel tree-LSTM
    of Choi et al. (2018) to NMT in order to create the encoder. We evaluate our model
    against sequential and supervised parsing baselines on three low- and medium-resource
    language pairs. For low-resource cases, the unsupervised tree2seq encoder significantly
    outperforms the baselines; no improvements are seen for medium-resource translation.

  abstract: Latent tree learning models represent sentences by composing their words
    according to an induced parse tree, all based on a downstream task. These models
    often outperform baselines which use (externally provided) syntax trees to drive
    the composition order. This work contributes (a) a new latent tree learning model
    based on shift-reduce parsing, with competitive downstream performance and non-trivial
    induced trees, and (b) an analysis of the trees learned by our shift-reduce model
    and by a chart-based model.

  abstract: Do unsupervised methods for learning rich, contextualized token representations
    obviate the need for explicit modeling of linguistic structure in neural network
    models for semantic role labeling (SRL)? We address this question by incorporating
    the massively successful ELMo embeddings (Peters et al., 2018) into LISA (Strubell
    and McCallum, 2018), a strong, linguistically-informed neural network architecture
    for SRL. In experiments on the CoNLL-2005 shared task we find that though ELMo
    out-performs typical word embeddings, beginning to close the gap in F1 between
    LISA with predicted and gold syntactic parses, syntactically-informed models still
    out-perform syntax-free models when both use ELMo, especially on out-of-domain
    data. Our results suggest that linguistic structures are indeed still relevant
    in this golden age of deep learning for NLP.

  abstract: This paper demonstrates a neural parser implementation suitable for consistently
    head-final languages such as Japanese. Unlike the transition- and graph-based
    algorithms in most state-of-the-art parsers, our parser directly selects the head
    word of a dependent from a limited number of candidates. This method drastically
    simplifies the model so that we can easily interpret the output of the neural
    model. Moreover, by exploiting grammatical knowledge to restrict possible modification
    types, we can control the output of the parser to reduce specific errors without
    adding annotated corpora. The neural parser performed well both on conventional
    Japanese corpora and the Japanese version of Universal Dependency corpus, and
    the advantages of distributed representations were observed in the comparison
    with the non-neural conventional model.

  abstract: "Despite the popularity of word embeddings, the precise way by which they\
    \ acquire semantic relations between words remain unclear. In the present article,\
    \ we investigate whether LSA and word2vec capacity to identify relevant semantic\
    \ relations increases with corpus size. One intuitive hypothesis is that the capacity\
    \ to identify relevant associations should increase as the amount of data increases.\
    \ However, if corpus size grows in topics which are not specific to the domain\
    \ of interest, signal to noise ratio may weaken. Here we investigate the effect\
    \ of corpus specificity and size in word-embeddings, and for this, we study two\
    \ ways for progressive elimination of documents: the elimination of random documents\
    \ vs. the elimination of documents unrelated to a specific task. We show that\
    \ word2vec can take advantage of all the documents, obtaining its best performance\
    \ when it is trained with the whole corpus. On the contrary, the specialization\
    \ (removal of out-of-domain documents) of the training corpus, accompanied by\
    \ a decrease of dimensionality, can increase LSA word-representation quality while\
    \ speeding up the processing time. From a cognitive-modeling point of view, we\
    \ point out that LSA\u2019s word-knowledge acquisitions may not be efficiently\
    \ exploiting higher-order co-occurrences and global relations, whereas word2vec\
    \ does."

  abstract: "We propose post-processing method for enriching not only word representation\
    \ but also its vector space using semantic lexicons, which we call extrofitting.\
    \ The method consists of 3 steps as follows: (i) Expanding 1 or more dimension(s)\
    \ on all the word vectors, filling with their representative value. (ii) Transferring\
    \ semantic knowledge by averaging each representative values of synonyms and filling\
    \ them in the expanded dimension(s). These two steps make representations of the\
    \ synonyms close together. (iii) Projecting the vector space using Linear Discriminant\
    \ Analysis, which eliminates the expanded dimension(s) with semantic knowledge.\
    \ When experimenting with GloVe, we find that our method outperforms Faruqui\u2019\
    s retrofitting on some of word similarity task. We also report further analysis\
    \ on our method in respect to word vector dimensions, vocabulary size as well\

  abstract: Recently, intelligent dialog systems and smart assistants have attracted
    the attention of many, and development of novel dialogue agents have become a
    research challenge. Intelligent agents that can handle both domain-specific task-oriented
    and open-domain chit-chat dialogs are one of the major requirements in the current
    systems. In order to address this issue and to realize such smart hybrid dialogue
    systems, we develop a model to discriminate user utterance between task-oriented
    and chit-chat conversations. We introduce a hybrid of convolutional neural network
    (CNN) and a lateral multiple timescale gated recurrent units (LMTGRU) that can
    represent multiple temporal scale dependencies for the discrimination task. With
    the help of the combined slow and fast units of the LMTGRU, our model effectively
    determines whether a user will have a chit-chat conversation or a task-specific
    conversation with the system. We also show that the LMTGRU structure helps the
    model to perform well on longer text inputs. We address the lack of dataset by
    constructing a dataset using Twitter and Maluuba Frames data. The results of the
    experiments demonstrate that the proposed hybrid network outperforms the conventional
    models on the chat discrimination task as well as performed comparable to the
    baselines on various benchmark datasets.

  abstract: Incomplete linguistic input, i.e. due to a noisy environment, is one of
    the challenges that a successful communication system has to deal with. In this
    paper, we study text completion with a data set composed of sentences with gaps
    where a successful completion cannot be achieved through a uni-modal (language-based)
    approach. We present a solution based on a context-integrating dependency parser
    incorporating an additional non-linguistic modality. An incompleteness in one
    channel is compensated by information from another one and the parser learns the
    association between the two modalities from a multiple level knowledge representation.
    We examined several model variations by adjusting the degree of influence of different
    modalities in the decision making on possible filler words and their exact reference
    to a non-linguistic context element. Our model is able to fill the gap with 95.4%
    word and 95.2% exact reference accuracy hence the successful prediction can be
    achieved not only on the word level (such as mug) but also with respect to the
    correct identification of its context reference (such as mug 2 among several mug
    instances).

  abstract: "A challenging task for word embeddings is to capture the emergent meaning\
    \ or polarity of a combination of individual words. For example, existing approaches\
    \ in word embeddings will assign high probabilities to the words \u201CPenguin\u201D\
    \ and \u201CFly\u201D if they frequently co-occur, but it fails to capture the\
    \ fact that they occur in an opposite sense - Penguins do not fly. We hypothesize\
    \ that humans do not associate a single polarity or sentiment to each word. The\
    \ word contributes to the overall polarity of a combination of words depending\
    \ upon which other words it is combined with. This is analogous to the behavior\
    \ of microscopic particles which exist in all possible states at the same time\
    \ and interfere with each other to give rise to new states depending upon their\
    \ relative phases. We make use of the Hilbert Space representation of such particles\
    \ in Quantum Mechanics where we subscribe a relative phase to each word, which\
    \ is a complex number, and investigate two such quantum inspired models to derive\
    \ the meaning of a combination of words. The proposed models achieve better performances\
    \ than state-of-the-art non-quantum models on binary sentence classification tasks."

  abstract: Natural language inference (NLI) is one of the most important tasks in
    NLP. In this study, we propose a novel method using word dictionaries, which are
    pairs of a word and its definition, as external knowledge. Our neural definition
    embedding mechanism encodes input sentences with the definitions of each word
    of the sentences on the fly. It can encode the definition of words considering
    the context of input sentences by using an attention mechanism. We evaluated our
    method using WordNet as a dictionary and confirmed that our method performed better
    than baseline models when using the full or a subset of 100d GloVe as word embeddings.

  abstract: We propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure, which keeps an RNN
    as the encoder and has a CNN as the decoder, and the model only explores the subsequent
    context information as the supervision. The asymmetry in both model architecture
    and training pair reduces a large amount of the training time. The contribution
    of our work is summarized as 1. We design experiments to show that an autoregressive
    decoder or an RNN decoder is not necessary for the encoder-decoder type of models
    in terms of learning sentence representations, and based on our results, we present
    2 findings. 2. The two interesting findings lead to our final model design, which
    has an RNN encoder and a CNN decoder, and it learns to encode the current sentence
    and decode the subsequent contiguous words all at once. 3. With a suite of techniques,
    our model performs good on downstream tasks and can be trained efficiently on
    a large unlabelled corpus.

  abstract: Representing sentences as numerical vectors while capturing their semantic
    context is an important and useful intermediate step in natural language processing.
    Representations that are both general and discriminative can serve as a tool for
    tackling various NLP tasks. While common sentence representation methods are unsupervised
    in nature, recently, an approach for learning universal sentence representation
    in a supervised setting was presented in (Conneau et al.,2017). We argue that
    although promising results were obtained, an improvement can be reached by adding
    various unsupervised constraints that are motivated by auto-encoders and by language
    models. We show that by adding such constraints, superior sentence embeddings
    can be achieved. We compare our method with the original implementation and show
    improvements in several tasks.

  abstract: To improve word embedding, subword information has been widely employed
    in state-of-the-art methods. These methods can be classified to either compositional
    or predictive models. In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning scheme, which
    integrates compositional and predictive model for word embedding. Such a scheme
    can take advantage of both models, thus effectively learning word embedding. The
    proposed scheme has been applied to learn word representation on Chinese. Our
    results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance
    of word embedding in terms of analogical reasoning and is robust to the size of
    training data.

  abstract: "Using a random walk model of text generation, Arora et al. (2017) proposed\
    \ a strong baseline for computing sentence embeddings: take a weighted average\
    \ of word embeddings and modify with SVD. This simple method even outperforms\
    \ far more complex approaches such as LSTMs on textual similarity tasks. In this\
    \ paper, we first show that word vector length has a confounding effect on the\
    \ probability of a sentence being generated in Arora et al.\u2019s model. We propose\
    \ a random walk model that is robust to this confound, where the probability of\
    \ word generation is inversely related to the angular distance between the word\
    \ and sentence embeddings. Our approach beats Arora et al.\u2019s by up to 44.4%\
    \ on textual similarity tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.\
    \ Unlike Arora et al.\u2019s method, ours requires no hyperparameter tuning, which\
    \ means it can be used when there is no labelled data."

  abstract: 'Embedding models typically associate each word with a single real-valued
    vector, representing its different properties. Evaluation methods, therefore,
    need to analyze the accuracy and completeness of these properties in embeddings.
    This requires fine-grained analysis of embedding subspaces. Multi-label classification
    is an appropriate way to do so. We propose a new evaluation method for word embeddings
    based on multi-label classification given a word embedding. The task we use is
    fine-grained name typing: given a large corpus, find all types that a name can
    refer to based on the name embedding. Given the scale of entities in knowledge
    bases, we can build datasets for this task that are complementary to the current
    embedding evaluation datasets in: they are very large, contain fine-grained classes,
    and allow the direct evaluation of embeddings without confounding factors like
    sentence context.'

  abstract: Learning vector space representation of words (i.e., word embeddings)
    has recently attracted wide research interests, and has been extended to cross-lingual
    scenario. Currently most cross-lingual word embedding learning models are based
    on sentence alignment, which inevitably introduces much noise. In this paper,
    we show in Chinese and Japanese, the acquisition of semantic relation among words
    can benefit from the large number of common characters shared by both languages;
    inspired by this unique feature, we design a method named CJC targeting to generate
    cross-lingual context of words. We combine CJC with GloVe based on matrix factorization,
    and then propose an integrated model named CJ-Glo. Taking two sentence-aligned
    models and CJ-BOC (also exploits common characters but is based on CBOW) as baseline
    algorithms, we compare them with CJ-Glo on a series of NLP tasks including cross-lingual
    synonym, word analogy and sentence alignment. The result indicates CJ-Glo achieves
    the best performance among these methods, and is more stable in cross-lingual
    tasks; moreover, compared with CJ-BOC, CJ-Glo is less sensitive to the alteration
    of parameters.

  abstract: Semantic networks and semantic spaces have been two prominent approaches
    to represent lexical semantics. While a unified account of the lexical meaning
    relies on one being able to convert between these representations, in both directions,
    the conversion direction from semantic networks into semantic spaces started to
    attract more attention recently. In this paper we present a methodology for this
    conversion and assess it with a case study. When it is applied over WordNet, the
    performance of the resulting embeddings in a mainstream semantic similarity task
    is very good, substantially superior to the performance of word embeddings based
    on very large collections of texts like word2vec.

  abstract: 'Word vector space specialisation models offer a portable, light-weight
    approach to fine-tuning arbitrary distributional vector spaces to discern between
    synonymy and antonymy. Their effectiveness is drawn from external linguistic constraints
    that specify the exact lexical relation between words. In this work, we show that
    a careful selection of the external constraints can steer and improve the specialisation.
    By simply selecting appropriate constraints, we report state-of-the-art results
    on a suite of tasks with well-defined benchmarks where modeling lexical contrast
    is crucial: 1) true semantic similarity, with highest reported scores on SimLex-999
    and SimVerb-3500 to date; 2) detecting antonyms; and 3) distinguishing antonyms
    from synonyms.'

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of using subword information
    in representation learning. We argue that using syntactic subword units effects
    the quality of the word representations positively. We introduce a morpheme-based
    model and compare it against to word-based, character-based, and character n-gram
    level models. Our model takes a list of candidate segmentations of a word and
    learns the representation of the word based on different segmentations that are
    weighted by an attention mechanism. We performed experiments on Turkish as a morphologically
    rich language and English with a comparably poorer morphology. The results show
    that morpheme-based models are better at learning word representations of morphologically
    complex languages compared to character-based and character n-gram level models
    since the morphemes help to incorporate more syntactic knowledge in learning,
    that makes morpheme-based models better at syntactic tasks.

  abstract: We propose a hierarchical model for sequential data that learns a tree
    on-the-fly, i.e. while reading the sequence. In the model, a recurrent network
    adapts its structure and reuses recurrent weights in a recursive manner. This
    creates adaptive skip-connections that ease the learning of long-term dependencies.
    The tree structure can either be inferred without supervision through reinforcement
    learning, or learned in a supervised manner. We provide preliminary experiments
    in a novel Math Expression Evaluation (MEE) task, which is created to have a hierarchical
    tree structure that can be used to study the effectiveness of our model. Additionally,
    we test our model in a well-known propositional logic and language modelling tasks.
    Experimental results have shown the potential of our approach.

  abstract: In this paper we continue experiments where neural machine translation
    training is used to produce joint cross-lingual fixed-dimensional sentence embeddings.
    In this framework we introduce a simple method of adding a loss to the learning
    objective which penalizes distance between representations of bilingually aligned
    sentences. We evaluate cross-lingual transfer using two approaches, cross-lingual
    similarity search on an aligned corpus (Europarl) and cross-lingual document classification
    on a recently published benchmark Reuters corpus, and we find the similarity loss
    significantly improves performance on both. Furthermore, we notice that while
    our Reuters results are very competitive, our English results are not as competitive,
    showing room for improvement in the current cross-lingual state-of-the-art. Our
    results are based on a set of 6 European languages.

  abstract: "While recurrent neural networks have found success in a variety of natural\
    \ language processing applications, they are general models of sequential data.\
    \ We investigate how the properties of natural language data affect an LSTM\u2019\
    s ability to learn a nonlinguistic task: recalling elements from its input. We\
    \ find that models trained on natural language data are able to recall tokens\
    \ from much longer sequences than models trained on non-language sequential data.\
    \ Furthermore, we show that the LSTM learns to solve the memorization task by\
    \ explicitly using a subset of its neurons to count timesteps in the input. We\
    \ hypothesize that the patterns and structure in natural language data enable\
    \ LSTMs to learn by providing approximate ways of reducing loss, but understanding\
    \ the effect of different training data on the learnability of LSTMs remains an\
    \ open question."

    \ gain insight about the challenges of encoding a text representation from low-level\
    \ features, e.g. from characters or pixels. We focus on Chinese, which\u2014as\
    \ a logographic language\u2014has properties that make a representation via visual\

    \ models\u2019 performance in a part-of-speech tagging task and also a semantic\
    \ similarity task. In summary, we show that it is possible to achieve a text representation\

  abstract: Learning representations for knowledge base entities and concepts is becoming
    increasingly important for NLP applications. However, recent entity embedding
    methods have relied on structured resources that are expensive to create for new
    domains and corpora. We present a distantly-supervised method for jointly learning
    embeddings of entities and text from an unnanotated corpus, using only a list
    of mappings between entities and surface forms. We learn embeddings from open-domain
    and biomedical corpora, and compare against prior methods that rely on human-annotated
    text or large knowledge graph structure. Our embeddings capture entity similarity
    and relatedness better than prior work, both in existing biomedical datasets and
    a new Wikipedia-based dataset that we release to the community. Results on analogy
    completion and entity sense disambiguation indicate that entities and words capture
    complementary information that can be effectively combined for downstream use.

  abstract: We explore a novel approach for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) by casting
    it as a sequence-to-sequence process. We employ an attention-based model enriched
    with a copying mechanism to ensure faithful regeneration of the input sequence,
    while enabling interleaved generation of argument role labels. We apply this model
    in a monolingual setting, performing PropBank SRL on English language data. The
    constrained sequence generation set-up enforced with the copying mechanism allows
    us to analyze the performance and special properties of the model on manually
    labeled data and benchmarking against state-of-the-art sequence labeling models.
    We show that our model is able to solve the SRL argument labeling task on English
    data, yet further structural decoding constraints will need to be added to make
    the model truly competitive. Our work represents the first step towards more advanced,
    generative SRL labeling setups.

  abstract: The notions of concreteness and imageability, traditionally important
    in psycholinguistics, are gaining significance in semantic-oriented natural language
    processing tasks. In this paper we investigate the predictability of these two
    concepts via supervised learning, using word embeddings as explanatory variables.
    We perform predictions both within and across languages by exploiting collections
    of cross-lingual embeddings aligned to a single vector space. We show that the
    notions of concreteness and imageability are highly predictable both within and
    across languages, with a moderate loss of up to 20% in correlation when predicting
    across languages. We further show that the cross-lingual transfer via word embeddings
    is more efficient than the simple transfer via bilingual dictionaries.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a dataset and supervised classification approach
    for economic event detection in English news articles. Currently, the economic
    domain is lacking resources and methods for data-driven supervised event detection.
    The detection task is conceived as a sentence-level classification task for 10
    different economic event types. Two different machine learning approaches were
    tested: a rich feature set Support Vector Machine (SVM) set-up and a word-vector-based
    long short-term memory recurrent neural network (RNN-LSTM) set-up. We show satisfactory
    results for most event types, with the linear kernel SVM outperforming the other
    experimental set-ups'

  abstract: Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the opinion expressed
    in text. Recently, it has been used to study behavioral finance, and in particular
    the effect of opinions and emotions on economic or financial decisions. In this
    paper, we use a public dataset of labeled tweets that has been labeled by Amazon
    Mechanical Turk and then we propose a baseline classification model. Then, by
    using Granger causality of both sentiment datasets with the different stocks,
    we shows that there is causality between social media and stock market returns
    (in both directions) for many stocks. Finally, We evaluate this causality analysis
    by showing that in the event of a specific news on certain dates, there are evidences
    of trending the same news on Twitter for that stock.

  abstract: In this paper, we use NLP techniques to detect linguistic uncertainty
    in financial disclosures. Leveraging general-domain and domain-specific word embedding
    models, we automatically expand an existing dictionary of uncertainty triggers.
    We furthermore examine how an expert filtering affects the quality of such an
    expansion. We show that the dictionary expansions significantly improve regressions
    on stock return volatility. Lastly, we prove that the expansions significantly
    boost the automatic detection of uncertain sentences.

  abstract: 'In the last years, compliance requirements for the banking sector have
    greatly augmented, making the current compliance processes difficult to maintain.
    Any process that allows to accelerate the identification and implementation of
    compliance requirements can help address this issues. The contributions of the
    paper are twofold: we propose a new NLP task that is the investment rule detection,
    and a group of methods identify them. We show that the proposed methods are highly
    performing and fast, thus can be deployed in production.'

  abstract: With the rising popularity of social media in the society and in research,
    analysing texts short in length, such as microblogs, becomes an increasingly important
    task. As a medium of communication, microblogs carry peoples sentiments and express
    them to the public. Given that sentiments are driven by multiple factors including
    the news media, the question arises if the sentiment expressed in news and the
    news article themselves can be leveraged to detect and classify sentiment in microblogs.
    Prior research has highlighted the impact of sentiments and opinions on the market
    dynamics, making the financial domain a prime case study for this approach. Therefore,
    this paper describes ongoing research dealing with the exploitation of news contained
    sentiment to improve microblog sentiment classification in a financial context.

  abstract: This paper focuses on aspect extraction which is a sub-task of Aspect-based
    Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to report an extraction method of financial aspects
    in microblog messages. Our approach uses a stock-investment taxonomy for the identification
    of explicit and implicit aspects. We compare supervised and unsupervised methods
    to assign predefined categories at message level. Results on 7 aspect classes
    show 0.71 accuracy, while the 32 class classification gives 0.82 accuracy for
    messages containing explicit aspects and 0.35 for implicit aspects.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised learning framework to use
    news events for predicting trends in stock prices. We present Word Influencer
    Networks (WIN), a graph framework to extract longitudinal temporal relationships
    between any pair of informative words from news streams. Using the temporal occurrence
    of words, WIN measures how the appearance of one word in a news stream influences
    the emergence of another set of words in the future. The latent word-word influencer
    relationships in WIN are the building blocks for causal reasoning and predictive
    modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of WIN by using it for unsupervised extraction
    of latent features for stock price prediction and obtain 2 orders lower prediction
    error compared to a similar causal graph based method. WIN discovered influencer
    links from seemingly unrelated words from topics like politics to finance. WIN
    also validated 67% of the causal evidence found manually in the text through a
    direct edge and the rest 33% through a path of length 2.

  abstract: 'Code-switching is the fluent alternation between two or more languages
    in conversation between bilinguals. Large populations of speakers code-switch
    during communication, but little effort has been made to develop tools for code-switching,
    including part-of-speech taggers. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS
    tagging of code-switched English-Spanish data based on recurrent neural networks.
    We test our model on known monolingual benchmarks to demonstrate that our neural
    POS tagging model is on par with state-of-the-art methods. We next test our code-switched
    methods on the Miami Bangor corpus of English Spanish conversation, focusing on
    two types of experiments: POS tagging alone, for which we achieve 96.34% accuracy,
    and joint part-of-speech and language ID tagging, which achieves similar POS tagging
    accuracy (96.39%) and very high language ID accuracy (98.78%). Finally, we show
    that our proposed models outperform other state-of-the-art code-switched taggers.'

  abstract: Speakers in multilingual communities often switch between or mix multiple
    languages in the same conversation. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of code-switched
    speech faces many challenges including the influence of phones of different languages
    on each other. This paper shows evidence that phone sharing between languages
    improves the Acoustic Model performance for Hindi-English code-switched speech.
    We compare baseline system built with separate phones for Hindi and English with
    systems where the phones were manually merged based on linguistic knowledge. Encouraged
    by the improved ASR performance after manually merging the phones, we further
    investigate multiple data-driven methods to identify phones to be merged across
    the languages. We show detailed analysis of automatic phone merging in this language
    pair and the impact it has on individual phone accuracies and WER. Though the
    best performance gain of 1.2% WER was observed with manually merged phones, we
    show experimentally that the manual phone merge is not optimal.

  abstract: We explore the effect of injecting background knowledge to different deep
    neural network (DNN) configurations in order to mitigate the problem of the scarcity
    of annotated data when applying these models on datasets of low-resourced languages.
    The background knowledge is encoded in the form of lexicons and pre-trained sub-word
    embeddings. The DNN models are evaluated on the task of detecting code-switching
    and borrowing points in non-standardised user-generated Algerian texts. Overall
    results show that DNNs benefit from adding background knowledge. However, the
    gain varies between models and categories. The proposed DNN architectures are
    generic and could be applied to other low-resourced languages.

  abstract: Code-Mixing (CM) is the phenomenon of alternating between two or more
    languages which is prevalent in bi- and multi-lingual communities. Most NLP applications
    today are still designed with the assumption of a single interaction language
    and are most likely to break given a CM utterance with multiple languages mixed
    at a morphological, phrase or sentence level. For example, popular commercial
    search engines do not yet fully understand the intents expressed in CM queries.
    As a first step towards fostering research which supports CM in NLP applications,
    we systematically crowd-sourced and curated an evaluation dataset for factoid
    question answering in three CM languages - Hinglish (Hindi+English), Tenglish
    (Telugu+English) and Tamlish (Tamil+English) which belong to two language families
    (Indo-Aryan and Dravidian). We share the details of our data collection process,
    techniques which were used to avoid inducing lexical bias amongst the crowd workers
    and other CM specific linguistic properties of the dataset. Our final dataset,
    which is available freely for research purposes, has 1,694 Hinglish, 2,848 Tamlish
    and 1,391 Tenglish factoid questions and their answers. We discuss the techniques
    used by the participants for the first edition of this ongoing challenge.

  abstract: 'Humans can learn multiple languages. If they know a fact in one language,
    they can answer a question in another language they understand. They can also
    answer Code-mix (CM) questions: questions which contain both languages. This behavior
    is attributed to the unique learning ability of humans. Our task aims to study
    if machines can achieve this. We demonstrate how effectively a machine can answer
    CM questions. In this work, we adopt a two phase approach: candidate generation
    and candidate re-ranking to answer questions. We propose a Triplet-Siamese-Hybrid
    CNN (TSHCNN) to re-rank candidate answers. We show experiments on the SimpleQuestions
    dataset. Our network is trained only on English questions provided in this dataset
    and noisy Hindi translations of these questions and can answer English-Hindi CM
    questions effectively without the need of translation into English. Back-transliterated
    CM questions outperform their lexical and sentence level translated counterparts
    by 5% & 35% in accuracy respectively, highlighting the efficacy of our approach
    in a resource constrained setting.'

  abstract: In this paper, we detail our work on comparing different word-level language
    identification systems for code-switched Hindi-English data and a standard Spanish-English
    dataset. In this regard, we build a new code-switched dataset for Hindi-English.
    To understand the code-switching patterns in these language pairs, we investigate
    different code-switching metrics. We find that the CRF model outperforms the neural
    network based models by a margin of 2-5 percentage points for Spanish-English
    and 3-5 percentage points for Hindi-English.

  abstract: Lack of text data has been the major issue on code-switching language
    modeling. In this paper, we introduce multi-task learning based language model
    which shares syntax representation of languages to leverage linguistic information
    and tackle the low resource data issue. Our model jointly learns both language
    modeling and Part-of-Speech tagging on code-switched utterances. In this way,
    the model is able to identify the location of code-switching points and improves
    the prediction of next word. Our approach outperforms standard LSTM based language
    model, with an improvement of 9.7% and 7.4% in perplexity on SEAME Phase I and
    Phase II dataset respectively.

  abstract: One language is often assumed to be dominant in code-switching but this
    assumption has not been empirically tested. We operationalize the matrix language
    (ML) at the level of the sentence, using three common definitions from linguistics.
    We test whether these converge and then model this convergence via a set of metrics
    that together quantify the nature of C-S. We conduct our experiment on four Spanish-English
    corpora. Our results demonstrate that our model can separate some corpora according
    to whether they have a dominant ML or not but that the corpora span a range of
    mixing types that cannot be sorted neatly into an insertional vs. alternational
    dichotomy.

  abstract: Multilingual speakers switch between languages in an non-trivial fashion
    displaying inter sentential, intra sentential, and congruent lexicalization based
    transitions. While monolingual ASR systems may be capable of recognizing a few
    words from a foreign language, they are usually not robust enough to handle these
    varied styles of code-switching. There is also a lack of large code-switched speech
    corpora capturing all these styles making it difficult to build code-switched
    speech recognition systems. We hypothesize that it may be useful for an ASR system
    to be able to first detect the switching style of a particular utterance from
    acoustics, and then use specialized language models or other adaptation techniques
    for decoding the speech. In this paper, we look at the first problem of detecting
    code-switching style from acoustics. We classify code-switched Spanish-English
    and Hindi-English corpora using two metrics and show that features extracted from
    acoustics alone can distinguish between different kinds of code-switching in these
    language pairs.

  abstract: Code-switching (CS), the practice of alternating between two or more languages
    in conversations, is pervasive in most multi-lingual communities. CS texts have
    a complex interplay between languages and occur in informal contexts that make
    them harder to collect and construct NLP tools for. We approach this problem through
    Language Modeling (LM) on a new Hindi-English mixed corpus containing 59,189 unique
    sentences collected from blogging websites. We implement and discuss different
    Language Models derived from a multi-layered LSTM architecture. We hypothesize
    that encoding language information strengthens a language model by helping to
    learn code-switching points. We show that our highest performing model achieves
    a test perplexity of 19.52 on the CS corpus that we collected and processed. On
    this data we demonstrate that our performance is an improvement over AWD-LSTM
    LM (a recent state of the art on monolingual English).

  abstract: Named Entity Recognition is an important information extraction task that
    identifies proper names in unstructured texts and classifies them into some pre-defined
    categories. Identification of named entities in code-mixed social media texts
    is a more difficult and challenging task as the contexts are short, ambiguous
    and often noisy. This work proposes a Conditional Random Fields based named entity
    recognition system to identify proper names in code-switched data and classify
    them into nine categories. The system ranked fifth among nine participant systems
    and achieved a 59.25% F1-score.

  abstract: Named Entity Recognition plays a major role in several downstream applications
    in NLP. Though this task has been heavily studied in formal monolingual texts
    and also noisy texts like Twitter data, it is still an emerging task in code-switched
    (CS) content on social media. This paper describes our participation in the shared
    task of NER on code-switched data for Spanglish (Spanish + English) and Arabish
    (Arabic + English). In this paper we describe models that intuitively developed
    from the data for the shared task Named Entity Recognition on Code-switched Data.
    Owing to the sparse and non-linear relationships between words in Twitter data,
    we explored neural architectures that are capable of non-linearities fairly well.
    In specific, we trained character level models and word level models based on
    Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs) to perform sequential tagging. We train multiple
    models to identify nominal mentions and subsequently use this information to predict
    the labels of named entity in a sequence. Our best model is a character level

  abstract: In the third shared task of the Computational Approaches to Linguistic
    Code-Switching (CALCS) workshop, we focus on Named Entity Recognition (NER) on
    code-switched social-media data. We divide the shared task into two competitions
    based on the English-Spanish (ENG-SPA) and Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian (MSA-EGY)
    language pairs. We use Twitter data and 9 entity types to establish a new dataset
    for code-switched NER benchmarks. In addition to the CS phenomenon, the diversity
    of the entities and the social media challenges make the task considerably hard
    to process. As a result, the best scores of the competitions are 63.76% and 71.61%
    for ENG-SPA and MSA-EGY, respectively. We present the scores of 9 participants
    and discuss the most common challenges among submissions.

  abstract: In the last decade, video blogs (vlogs) have become an extremely popular
    method through which people express sentiment. The ubiquitousness of these videos
    has increased the importance of multimodal fusion models, which incorporate video
    and audio features with traditional text features for automatic sentiment detection.
    Multimodal fusion offers a unique opportunity to build models that learn from
    the full depth of expression available to human viewers. In the detection of sentiment
    in these videos, acoustic and video features provide clarity to otherwise ambiguous
    transcripts. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion model that exclusively
    uses high-level video and audio features to analyze spoken sentences for sentiment.
    We discard traditional transcription features in order to minimize human intervention
    and to maximize the deployability of our model on at-scale real-world data. We
    select high-level features for our model that have been successful in non-affect
    domains in order to test their generalizability in the sentiment detection domain.
    We train and test our model on the newly released CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment
    and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) dataset, obtaining an F1 score of 0.8049 on
    the validation set and an F1 score of 0.6325 on the held-out challenge test set.

  abstract: We present our system description of input-level multimodal fusion of
    audio, video, and text for recognition of emotions and their intensities for the
    2018 First Grand Challenge on Computational Modeling of Human Multimodal Language.
    Our proposed approach is based on input-level feature fusion with sequence learning
    from Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) deep neural networks (DNNs).
    We show that our fusion approach outperforms unimodal predictors. Our system performs
    6-way simultaneous classification and regression, allowing for overlapping emotion
    labels in a video segment. This leads to an overall binary accuracy of 90%, overall
    4-class accuracy of 89.2% and an overall mean-absolute-error (MAE) of 0.12. Our
    work shows that an early fusion technique can effectively predict the presence
    of multi-label emotions as well as their coarse-grained intensities. The presented
    multimodal approach creates a simple and robust baseline on this new Grand Challenge
    dataset. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of emotion intensity distributions
    as output from our DNN, as well as a related discussion concerning the inherent
    difficulty of this task.

  abstract: Understanding Affect from video segments has brought researchers from
    the language, audio and video domains together. Most of the current multimodal
    research in this area deals with various techniques to fuse the modalities, and
    mostly treat the segments of a video independently. Motivated by the work of (Zadeh
    et al., 2017) and (Poria et al., 2017), we present our architecture, Relational
    Tensor Network, where we use the inter-modal interactions within a segment (intra-segment)
    and also consider the sequence of segments in a video to model the inter-segment
    inter-modal interactions. We also generate rich representations of text and audio
    modalities by leveraging richer audio and linguistic context alongwith fusing
    fine-grained knowledge based polarity scores from text. We present the results
    of our model on CMU-MOSEI dataset and show that our model outperforms many baselines
    and state of the art methods for sentiment classification and emotion recognition.

  abstract: Emotion recognition has become a popular topic of interest, especially
    in the field of human computer interaction. Previous works involve unimodal analysis
    of emotion, while recent efforts focus on multimodal emotion recognition from
    vision and speech. In this paper, we propose a new method of learning about the
    hidden representations between just speech and text data using convolutional attention
    networks. Compared to the shallow model which employs simple concatenation of
    feature vectors, the proposed attention model performs much better in classifying
    emotion from speech and text data contained in the CMU-MOSEI dataset.

  abstract: Multimodal sentiment classification in practical applications may have
    to rely on erroneous and imperfect views, namely (a) language transcription from
    a speech recognizer and (b) under-performing acoustic views. This work focuses
    on improving the representations of these views by performing a deep canonical
    correlation analysis with the representations of the better performing manual
    transcription view. Enhanced representations of the imperfect views can be obtained
    even in absence of the perfect views and give an improved performance during test
    conditions. Evaluations on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate the
    effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  abstract: 'Current multimodal sentiment analysis frames sentiment score prediction
    as a general Machine Learning task. However, what the sentiment score actually
    represents has often been overlooked. As a measurement of opinions and affective
    states, a sentiment score generally consists of two aspects: polarity and intensity.
    We decompose sentiment scores into these two aspects and study how they are conveyed
    through individual modalities and combined multimodal models in a naturalistic
    monologue setting. In particular, we build unimodal and multimodal multi-task
    learning models with sentiment score prediction as the main task and polarity
    and/or intensity classification as the auxiliary tasks. Our experiments show that
    sentiment analysis benefits from multi-task learning, and individual modalities
    differ when conveying the polarity and intensity aspects of sentiment.'

  abstract: During the last decade, the applications of signal processing have drastically
    improved with deep learning. However areas of affecting computing such as emotional
    speech synthesis or emotion recognition from spoken language remains challenging.
    In this paper, we investigate the use of a neural Automatic Speech Recognition
    (ASR) as a feature extractor for emotion recognition. We show that these features
    outperform the eGeMAPS feature set to predict the valence and arousal emotional
    dimensions, which means that the audio-to-text mapping learned by the ASR system
    contains information related to the emotional dimensions in spontaneous speech.
    We also examine the relationship between first layers (closer to speech) and last
    layers (closer to text) of the ASR and valence/arousal.

  abstract: 'Multimodal machine learning is a core research area spanning the language,
    visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge in multimodal learning involves
    learning representations that can process and relate information from multiple
    modalities. In this paper, we propose two methods for unsupervised learning of
    joint multimodal representations using sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) methods:
    a Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model and a Hierarchical Seq2Seq Modality Translation
    Model. We also explore multiple different variations on the multimodal inputs
    and outputs of these seq2seq models. Our experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis
    using the CMU-MOSI dataset indicate that our methods learn informative multimodal
    representations that outperform the baselines and achieve improved performance
    on multimodal sentiment analysis, specifically in the Bimodal case where our model
    is able to improve F1 Score by twelve points. We also discuss future directions
    for multimodal Seq2Seq methods.'

  abstract: We present our work on sentiment prediction using the benchmark MOSI dataset
    from the CMU-MultimodalDataSDK. Previous work on multimodal sentiment analysis
    have been focused on input-level feature fusion or decision-level fusion for multimodal
    fusion. Here, we propose an intermediate-level feature fusion, which merges weights
    from each modality (audio, video, and text) during training with subsequent additional
    training. Moreover, we tested principle component analysis (PCA) for feature selection.
    We found that applying PCA increases unimodal performance, and multimodal fusion
    outperforms unimodal models. Our experiments show that our proposed intermediate-level
    feature fusion outperforms other fusion techniques, and it achieves the best performance
    with an overall binary accuracy of 74.0% on video+text modalities. Our work also
    improves feature selection for unimodal sentiment analysis, while proposing a
    novel and effective multimodal fusion architecture for this task.

  abstract: 'Neural part-of-speech (POS) taggers are known to not perform well with
    little training data. As a step towards overcoming this problem, we present an
    architecture for learning more robust neural POS taggers by jointly training a
    hierarchical, recurrent model and a recurrent character-based sequence-to-sequence
    network supervised using an auxiliary objective. This way, we introduce stronger
    character-level supervision into the model, which enables better generalization
    to unseen words and provides regularization, making our encoding less prone to
    overfitting. We experiment with three auxiliary tasks: lemmatization, character-based
    word autoencoding, and character-based random string autoencoding. Experiments
    with minimal amounts of labeled data on 34 languages show that our new architecture
    outperforms a single-task baseline and, surprisingly, that, on average, raw text
    autoencoding can be as beneficial for low-resource POS tagging as using lemma
    information. Our neural POS tagger closes the gap to a state-of-the-art POS tagger
    (MarMoT) for low-resource scenarios by 43%, even outperforming it on languages
    with templatic morphology, e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, and Turkish, by some margin.'

  abstract: Icon-based communication systems are widely used in the field of Augmentative
    and Alternative Communication. Typically, icon-based systems have lagged behind
    word- and character-based systems in terms of predictive typing functionality,
    due to the challenges inherent to training icon-based language models. We propose
    a method for synthesizing training data for use in icon-based language models,
    and explore two different modeling strategies. We propose a method to generate
    language models for corpus-less symbol-set.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of training a multimodal
    neural machine translation (MNMT) system with image features for a low-resource
    language pair, Hindi and English, using synthetic data. A three-way parallel corpus
    which contains bilingual texts and corresponding images is required to train a
    MNMT system with image features. However, such a corpus is not available for low
    resource language pairs. To address this, we developed both a synthetic training
    dataset and a manually curated development/test dataset for Hindi based on an
    existing English-image parallel corpus. We used these datasets to build our image
    description translation system by adopting state-of-the-art MNMT models. Our results
    show that it is possible to train a MNMT system for low-resource language pairs
    through the use of synthetic data and that such a system can benefit from image
    features.

  abstract: Most Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) approaches are supervised methods which
    require a significant amount of annotated corpus, and the annotation requires
    linguistic expertise. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Active Learning framework
    for Semantic Role Labeling with Entity Recognition (ER) as the auxiliary task
    to alleviate the need for extensive data and use additional information from ER
    to help SRL. We evaluate our approach on Indonesian conversational dataset. Our
    experiments show that multi-task active learning can outperform single-task active
    learning method and standard multi-task learning. According to our results, active
    learning is more efficient by using 12% less of training data compared to passive
    learning in both single-task and multi-task setting. We also introduce a new dataset
    for SRL in Indonesian conversational domain to encourage further research in this
    area.

  abstract: Generic word embeddings are trained on large-scale generic corpora; Domain
    Specific (DS) word embeddings are trained only on data from a domain of interest.
    This paper proposes a method to combine the breadth of generic embeddings with
    the specificity of domain specific embeddings. The resulting embeddings, called
    Domain Adapted (DA) word embeddings, are formed by first aligning corresponding
    word vectors using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or the related nonlinear
    Kernel CCA (KCCA) and then combining them via convex optimization. Results from
    evaluation on sentiment classification tasks show that the DA embeddings substantially
    outperform both generic, DS embeddings when used as input features to standard
    or state-of-the-art sentence encoding algorithms for classification.

  abstract: Fine-tuning is a popular method to achieve better performance when only
    a small target corpus is available. However, it requires tuning of a number of
    metaparameters and thus it might carry risk of adverse effect when inappropriate
    metaparameters are used. Therefore, we investigate effective parameters for fine-tuning
    when only a small target corpus is available. In the current study, we target
    at improving Japanese word embeddings created from a huge corpus. First, we demonstrate
    that even the word embeddings created from the huge corpus are affected by domain
    shift. After that, we investigate effective parameters for fine-tuning of the
    word embeddings using a small target corpus. We used perplexity of a language
    model obtained from a Long Short-Term Memory network to assess the word embeddings
    input into the network. The experiments revealed that fine-tuning sometimes give
    adverse effect when only a small target corpus is used and batch size is the most
    important parameter for fine-tuning. In addition, we confirmed that effect of
    fine-tuning is higher when size of a target corpus was larger.

  abstract: "The lack of high-quality labeled training data has been one of the critical\
    \ challenges facing many industrial machine learning tasks. To tackle this challenge,\
    \ in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to utilize unlabeled\
    \ data and user feedback signals to improve the performance of ML models. The\
    \ method employs a primary model Main and an auxiliary evaluation model Eval,\
    \ where Main and Eval models are trained iteratively by automatically generating\
    \ labeled data from unlabeled data and/or users\u2019 feedback signals. The proposed\
    \ approach is applied to different text classification tasks. We report results\
    \ on both the publicly available Yahoo! Answers dataset and our e-commerce product\
    \ classification dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method\
    \ reduces the classification error rate by 4% and up to 15% across various experimental\
    \ setups and datasets. A detailed comparison with other semi-supervised learning\
    \ approaches is also presented later in the paper. The results from various text\
    \ classification tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms those developed\
    \ in previous related studies."

  abstract: "Various common deep learning architectures, such as LSTMs, GRUs, Resnets\
    \ and Highway Networks, employ state passthrough connections that support training\
    \ with high feed-forward depth or recurrence over many time steps. These \u201C\
    Passthrough Networks\u201D architectures also enable the decoupling of the network\
    \ state size from the number of parameters of the network, a possibility has been\
    \ studied by Sak et al. (2014) with their low-rank parametrization of the LSTM.\
    \ In this work we extend this line of research, proposing effective, low-rank\
    \ and low-rank plus diagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks\
    \ which exploit this decoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory\
    \ requirements of the network while preserving its memory capacity. This is particularly\
    \ beneficial in low-resource settings as it supports expressive models with a\
    \ compact parametrization less susceptible to overfitting. We present competitive\
    \ experimental results on several tasks, including language modeling and a near\
    \ state of the art result on sequential randomly-permuted MNIST classification,\
    \ a hard task on natural data."

  abstract: 'Code-mixing is a linguistic phenomenon where multiple languages are used
    in the same occurrence that is increasingly common in multilingual societies.
    Code-mixed content on social media is also on the rise, prompting the need for
    tools to automatically understand such content. Automatic Parts-of-Speech (POS)
    tagging is an essential step in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline,
    but there is a lack of annotated data to train such models. In this work, we present
    a unique language tagged and POS-tagged dataset of code-mixed English-Hindi tweets
    related to five incidents in India that led to a lot of Twitter activity. Our
    dataset is unique in two dimensions: (i) it is larger than previous annotated
    datasets and (ii) it closely resembles typical real-world tweets. Additionally,
    we present a POS tagging model that is trained on this dataset to provide an example
    of how this dataset can be used. The model also shows the efficacy of our dataset
    in enabling the creation of code-mixed social media POS taggers.'

  abstract: 'The exponential rise of social media websites like Twitter, Facebook
    and Reddit in linguistically diverse geographical regions has led to hybridization
    of popular native languages with English in an effort to ease communication. The
    paper focuses on the classification of offensive tweets written in Hinglish language,
    which is a portmanteau of the Indic language Hindi with the Roman script. The
    paper introduces a novel tweet dataset, titled Hindi-English Offensive Tweet (HEOT)
    dataset, consisting of tweets in Hindi-English code switched language split into
    three classes: non-offensive, abusive and hate-speech. Further, we approach the
    problem of classification of the tweets in HEOT dataset using transfer learning
    wherein the proposed model employing Convolutional Neural Networks is pre-trained
    on tweets in English followed by retraining on Hinglish tweets.'

  abstract: This paper describes an overview of the Dialogue Emotion Recognition Challenge,
    EmotionX, at the Sixth SocialNLP Workshop, which recognizes the emotion of each
    utterance in dialogues. This challenge offers the EmotionLines dataset as the
    experimental materials. The EmotionLines dataset contains conversations from Friends
    TV show transcripts (Friends) and real chatting logs (EmotionPush), where every
    dialogue utterance is labeled with emotions. Organizers provide baseline results.
    18 teams registered in this challenge and 5 of them submitted their results successfully.
    The best team achieves the unweighted accuracy 62.48 and 62.5 on EmotionPush and
    Friends, respectively. In this paper we present the task definition, test collection,
    the evaluation results of the groups that participated in this challenge, and
    their approach.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a self-attentive bidirectional long short-term
    memory (SA-BiLSTM) network to predict multiple emotions for the EmotionX challenge.
    The BiLSTM exhibits the power of modeling the word dependencies, and extracting
    the most relevant features for emotion classification. Building on top of BiLSTM,
    the self-attentive network can model the contextual dependencies between utterances
    which are helpful for classifying the ambiguous emotions. We achieve 59.6 and
    55.0 unweighted accuracy scores in the Friends and the EmotionPush test sets,
    respectively.

    improves performance. Quantitative evaluation with jointly trained network, augmented
    with linguistic features, reports best accuracies for emotion prediction; namely
    joy, sadness, anger, and neutral emotion in text.

  abstract: This paper presents our system submitted to the EmotionX challenge. It
    is an emotion detection task on dialogues in the EmotionLines dataset. We formulate
    this as a hierarchical network where network learns data representation at both
    utterance level and dialogue level. Our model is inspired by Hierarchical Attention
    network (HAN) and uses pre-trained word embeddings as features. We formulate emotion
    detection in dialogues as a sequence labeling problem to capture the dependencies
    among labels. We report the performance accuracy for four emotions (anger, joy,
    neutral and sadness). The model achieved unweighted accuracy of 55.38% on Friends
    test dataset and 56.73% on EmotionPush test dataset. We report an improvement
    of 22.51% in Friends dataset and 36.04% in EmotionPush dataset over baseline results.

  abstract: This paper addresses the problem of automatic recognition of emotions
    in conversational text datasets for the EmotionX challenge. Emotion is a human
    characteristic expressed through several modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, tactile).
    Trying to detect emotions only from the text becomes a difficult task even for
    humans. This paper evaluates several neural architectures based on Attention Models,
    which allow extracting relevant parts of the context within a conversation to
    identify the emotion associated with each utterance. Empirical results in the
    validation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach compared to
    the reference models for some instances, and other cases show better results with
    simpler models.

  abstract: In this paper, we discuss the enrichment of a manually developed resource,
    OntoSenseNet for Telugu. OntoSenseNet is a sense annotated resource that marks
    each verb of Telugu with a primary and a secondary sense. The area of research
    is relatively recent but has a large scope of development. We provide an introductory
    work to enrich the OntoSenseNet to promote further research in Telugu. Classifiers
    are adopted to learn the sense relevant features of the words in the resource
    and also to automate the tagging of sense-types for verbs. We perform a comparative
    analysis of different classifiers applied on OntoSenseNet. The results of the
    experiment prove that automated enrichment of the resource is effective using
    SVM classifiers and Adaboost ensemble.

  abstract: 'A large amount of social media data is generated during natural disasters,
    and identifying the relevant portions of this data is critical for researchers
    attempting to understand human behavior, the effects of information sources, and
    preparatory actions undertaken during these events. In order to classify human
    behavior during hazard events, we employ machine learning for two tasks: identifying
    hurricane related tweets and classifying user evacuation behavior during hurricanes.
    We show that feature-based and deep learning methods provide different benefits
    for tweet classification, and ensemble-based methods using linguistic, temporal,
    and geospatial features can effectively classify user behavior.'

  abstract: In this study we propose a new approach to analyse the political discourse
    in on-line social networks such as Twitter. To do so, we have built a discourse
    classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our model has been trained using
    election manifestos annotated manually by political scientists following the Regional
    Manifestos Project (RMP) methodology. In total, it has been trained with more
    than 88,000 sentences extracted from more that 100 annotated manifestos. Our approach
    takes into account the context of the phrase in order to classify it, like what
    was previously said and the political affiliation of the transmitter. To improve
    the classification results we have used a simplified political message taxonomy
    developed within the Electronic Regional Manifestos Project (E-RMP). Using this
    taxonomy, we have validated our approach analysing the Twitter activity of the
    main Spanish political parties during 2015 and 2016 Spanish general election and
    providing a study of their discourse.

  abstract: Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 is a workshop on generating sentences
    from lemmatized sets of dependency triples. This paper describes the results of
    our participation in the challenge. We develop a data-driven pipeline system which
    first orders the lemmas and then conjugates the words to finish the surface realization
    process. Our contribution is a novel sequential method of ordering lemmas, which,
    despite its simplicity, achieves promising results. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach, describe its limitations and outline ways to improve
    it.

    team to the shallow task of the Multilingual Surface Realization Shared Task 2018
    (SR18). Based on (Castro Ferreira et al., 2017), the approach works by first preprocessing
    an input dependency tree into an ordered linearized string, which is then realized
    using a statistical machine translation model. Our approach shows promising results,
    with BLEU scores above 50 for 5 different languages (English, French, Italian,

  abstract: Surface realization is a nontrivial task as it involves taking structured
    data and producing grammatically and semantically correct utterances. Many competing
    grammar-based and statistical models for realization still struggle with relatively
    simple sentences. For our submission to the 2018 Surface Realization Shared Task,
    we tackle the shallow task by first generating inflected wordforms with a neural
    sequence-to-sequence model before incrementally linearizing them. For linearization,
    we use a global linear model trained using early update that makes use of features
    that take into account the dependency structure and dependency locality. Using
    this pipeline sufficed to produce surprisingly strong results in the shared task.
    In future work, we intend to pursue joint approaches to linearization and morphological
    inflection and incorporating a neural language model into the linearization choices.

  abstract: This work presents state of the art results in reconstruction of surface
    realizations from obfuscated text. We identify the lack of sufficient training
    data as the major obstacle to training high-performing models, and solve this
    issue by generating large amounts of synthetic training data. We also propose
    preprocessing techniques which make the structure contained in the input features
    more accessible to sequence models. Our models were ranked first on all evaluation
    metrics in the English portion of the 2018 Surface Realization shared task.

  abstract: This paper describes the system developed by the DipInfo-UniTo team to
    participate to the shallow track of the Surface Realization Shared Task 2018.
    The system employs two separate neural networks with different architectures to
    predict the word ordering and the morphological inflection independently from
    each other. The UniTO realizer is language independent, and its simple architecture
    allowed it to be scored in the central part of the final ranking of the shared
    task.

  abstract: "In this paper, we have proposed a technique for generating complex reading\

    \ derived from assertions. Our system produces a set of general-level questions\
    \ using coherence relations and a set of well-defined syntactic transformations\
    \ on the input text. Generated questions evaluate comprehension abilities like\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of the text and its structure, correct identification\
    \ of the author\u2019s intent, a thorough evaluation of stated arguments; and\
    \ a deduction of the high-level semantic relations that hold between text spans.\
    \ Experiments performed on the RST-DT corpus allow us to conclude that our system\

  abstract: Advances in automatic readability assessment can impact the way people
    consume information in a number of domains. Arabic, being a low-resource and morphologically
    complex language, presents numerous challenges to the task of automatic readability
    assessment. In this paper, we present the largest and most in-depth computational
    readability study for Arabic to date. We study a large set of features with varying
    depths, from shallow words to syntactic trees, for both L1 and L2 readability
    tasks. Our best L1 readability accuracy result is 94.8% (75% error reduction from
    a commonly used baseline). The comparable results for L2 are 72.4% (45% error
    reduction). We also demonstrate the added value of leveraging L1 features for
    L2 readability prediction.

  abstract: Essays have two major components for scoring - content and style. In this
    paper, we describe a property of the essay, called goodness, and use it to predict
    the score given for the style of student essays. We compare our approach to solve
    this problem with baseline approaches, like language modeling and also a state-of-the-art
    deep learning system. We show that, despite being quite intuitive, our approach
    is very powerful in predicting the style of the essays.

    Error Diagnosis (CGED) which seeks to identify grammatical error types, their
    range of occurrence and recommended corrections within sentences written by learners
    of Chinese as foreign language. We describe the task definition, data preparation,
    performance metrics, and evaluation results. Of the 20 teams registered for this
    shared task, 13 teams developed the system and submitted a total of 32 runs. Progress
    in system performances was obviously, reaching F1 of 36.12% in position level
    and 25.27% in correction level. All data sets with gold standards and scoring
    scripts are made publicly available to researchers.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our system at NLPTEA-2018 Task #1: Chinese Grammatical
    Error Diagnosis. Grammatical Error Diagnosis is one of the most challenging NLP
    tasks, which is to locate grammar errors and tell error types. Our system is built
    on the model of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with a conditional random
    field layer (BiLSTM-CRF) but integrates with several new features. First, richer
    features are considered in the BiLSTM-CRF model; second, a probabilistic ensemble
    approach is adopted; third, Template Matcher are used during a post-processing
    to bring in human knowledge. In official evaluation, our system obtains the highest
    F1 scores at identifying error types and locating error positions, the second
    highest F1 score at sentence level error detection. We also recommend error corrections
    for specific error types and achieve the best F1 performance among all participants.'

  abstract: "This paper introduces the DM_NLP team\u2019s system for NLPTEA 2018 shared\
    \ task of Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED), which can be used to detect\
    \ and correct grammatical errors in texts written by Chinese as a Foreign Language\
    \ (CFL) learners. This task aims at not only detecting four types of grammatical\
    \ errors including redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word selection\
    \ (S) and disordered words (W), but also recommending corrections for errors of\
    \ M and S types. We proposed a hybrid system including four models for this task\
    \ with two stages: the detection stage and the correction stage. In the detection\
    \ stage, we first used a BiLSTM-CRF model to tag potential errors by sequence\
    \ labeling, along with some handcraft features. Then we designed three Grammatical\
    \ Error Correction (GEC) models to generate corrections, which could help to tune\
    \ the detection result. In the correction stage, candidates were generated by\
    \ the three GEC models and then merged to output the final corrections for M and\
    \ S types. Our system reached the highest precision in the correction subtask,\
    \ which was the most challenging part of this shared task, and got top 3 on F1\
    \ scores for position detection of errors."

  abstract: In this study, we employ the sequence to sequence learning to model the
    task of grammar error correction. The system takes potentially erroneous sentences
    as inputs, and outputs correct sentences. To breakthrough the bottlenecks of very
    limited size of manually labeled data, we adopt a semi-supervised approach. Specifically,
    we adapt correct sentences written by native Chinese speakers to generate pseudo
    grammatical errors made by learners of Chinese as a second language. We use the
    pseudo data to pre-train the model, and the CGED data to fine-tune it. Being aware
    of the significance of precision in a grammar error correction system in real
    scenarios, we use ensembles to boost precision. When using inputs as simple as
    Chinese characters, the ensembled system achieves a precision at 86.56% in the
    detection of erroneous sentences, and a precision at 51.53% in the correction
    of errors of Selection and Missing types.

  abstract: "Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED) is a natural language processing\
    \ task for the NLPTEA2018 workshop held during ACL2018. The goal of this task\
    \ is to diagnose Chinese sentences containing four kinds of grammatical errors\
    \ through the model and find out the sentence errors. Chinese grammatical error\
    \ diagnosis system is a very important tool, which can help Chinese learners automatically\
    \ diagnose grammatical errors in many scenarios. However, due to the limitations\
    \ of the Chinese language\u2019s own characteristics and datasets, the traditional\
    \ model faces the problem of extreme imbalances in the positive and negative samples\
    \ and the disappearance of gradients. In this paper, we propose a sequence labeling\
    \ method based on the Policy Gradient LSTM model and apply it to this task to\
    \ solve the above problems. The results show that our model can achieve higher\
    \ precision scores in the case of lower False positive rate (FPR) and it is convenient\

  abstract: "Verbal communication \u2014 and pronunciation as its part \u2014 is a\
    \ core skill that can be developed through guided learning. An artificial intelligence\
    \ system can take a role in these guided learning approaches as an enabler of\
    \ an application for pronunciation learning with a recommender system to guide\
    \ language learners through exercises and feedback system to correct their pronunciation.\
    \ In this paper, we report on a user study on language learners\u2019 perceived\
    \ usefulness of the application. 16 international students who spoke non-native\
    \ English and lived in Australia participated. 13 of them said they need to improve\
    \ their pronunciation skills in English because of their foreign accent. The feedback\
    \ system with features for pronunciation scoring, speech replay, and giving a\
    \ pronunciation example was deemed essential by most of the respondents. In contrast,\
    \ a clear dichotomy between the recommender system perceived as useful or useless\
    \ existed; the system had features to prompt new common words or old poorly-scored\
    \ words. These results can be used to target research and development from information\

  abstract: PerspectivesX is a multi-perspective elaboration tool designed to encourage
    learner submission and curation across a range of collaborative learning activities.
    In this paper, it is shown that the learning design objectives of collaborative
    learning activities can be evaluated using NLP techniques, but that careful analysis
    of learner impact and pedagogical intent are required in order to select appropriate
    techniques. In particular, this paper focuses on the NLP techniques required to
    deliver an instructor dashboard, personalized learner feedback and content recommendation
    within multi-perspective elaboration activities. Key NLP techniques considered
    for inclusion include summarization, topic modeling, paraphrase detection and
    diversified content recommendation.

  abstract: In this paper we present a qualitatively enhanced deep convolution recurrent
    neural network for computing the quality of a text in an automatic essay scoring
    task. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that instead of considering only
    the word and sentence representation of a text, we try to augment the different
    complex linguistic, cognitive and psycological features associated within a text
    document along with a hierarchical convolution recurrent neural network framework.
    Our preliminary investigation shows that incorporation of such qualitative feature
    vectors along with standard word/sentence embeddings can give us better understanding
    about improving the overall evaluation of the input essays.

  abstract: This paper describes two models that employ word frequency embeddings
    to deal with the problem of readability assessment in multiple languages. The
    task is to determine the difficulty level of a given document, i.e., how hard
    it is for a reader to fully comprehend the text. The proposed models show how
    frequency information can be integrated to improve the readability assessment.
    The experimental results testing on both English and Chinese datasets show that
    the proposed models improve the results notably when comparing to those using
    only traditional word embeddings.

  abstract: MULLE is a tool for language learning that focuses on teaching Latin as
    a foreign language. It is aimed for easy integration into the traditional classroom
    setting and syllabus, which makes it distinct from other language learning tools
    that provide standalone learning experience. It uses grammar-based lessons and
    embraces methods of gamification to improve the learner motivation. The main type
    of exercise provided by our application is to practice translation, but it is
    also possible to shift the focus to vocabulary or morphology training.

  abstract: "Childhood acquisition of written language is not straightforward. Writing\
    \ skills evolve differently depending on external factors, such as the conditions\
    \ in which children practice their productions and the quality of their instructors\u2019\
    \ guidance. This can be challenging in low-income areas, where schools may struggle\

    \ few work exists on the use of information technologies to improve childhood\
    \ literacy. This work centers around the computational study of Spanish word and\
    \ syllable structure in documents written by 2nd and 3rd year elementary school\
    \ students. The studied texts were compared against a corpus of short stories\
    \ aimed at the same age group, so as to observe whether the children tend to produce\
    \ similar written patterns as the ones they are expected to interpret at their\
    \ literacy level. The obtained results show some significant differences between\

  abstract: This study explores the use of natural language processing techniques
    to enhance bilingual lexical access beyond simple equivalents, to enable translators
    to navigate along a wider cross-lingual lexical space and more examples showing
    different translation strategies, which is essential for them to learn to produce
    not only faithful but also fluent translations.

  abstract: We systematically confirm that instructors are strongly influenced by
    the user interface presentation of Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) discussion
    forums. In a large scale dataset, we conclusively show that instructor interventions
    exhibit strong position bias, as measured by the position where the thread appeared
    on the user interface at the time of intervention. We measure and remove this
    bias, enabling unbiased statistical modelling and evaluation. We show that our
    de-biased classifier improves predicting interventions over the state-of-the-art
    on courses with sufficient number of interventions by 8.2% in F1 and 24.4% in
    recall on average.

  abstract: Search engine is an important tool of modern academic study, but the results
    are lack of measurement of beginner friendliness. In order to improve the efficiency
    of using search engine for academic study, it is necessary to invent a technique
    of measuring the beginner friendliness of a Web page explaining academic concepts
    and to build an automatic measurement system. This paper studies how to integrate
    heterogeneous features such as a neural image feature generated from the image
    of the Web page by a variant of CNN (convolutional neural network) as well as
    text features extracted from the body text of the HTML file of the Web page. Integration
    is performed through the framework of the SVM classifier learning. Evaluation
    results show that heterogeneous features perform better than each individual type
    of features.

  abstract: Text clustering is a powerful technique to detect topics from document
    corpora, so as to provide information browsing, analysis, and organization. On
    the other hand, the Instant Response System (IRS) has been widely used in recent
    years to enhance student engagement in class and thus improve their learning effectiveness.
    However, the lack of functions to process short text responses from the IRS prevents
    the further application of IRS in classes. Therefore, this study aims to propose
    a proper short text clustering module for the IRS, and demonstrate our implemented
    techniques through real-world examples, so as to provide experiences and insights
    for further study. In particular, we have compared three clustering methods and
    the result shows that theoretically better methods need not lead to better results,
    as there are various factors that may affect the final performance.

  abstract: When learning Chinese as a foreign language, the learners may have some
    grammatical errors due to negative migration of their native languages. However,
    few grammar checking applications have been developed to support the learners.
    The goal of this paper is to develop a tool to automatically diagnose four types
    of grammatical errors which are redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word
    selection (S) and disordered words (W) in Chinese sentences written by those foreign
    learners. In this paper, a conventional linear CRF model with specific feature
    engineering and a LSTM-CRF model are used to solve the CGED (Chinese Grammatical
    Error Diagnosis) task. We make some improvement on both models and the submitted
    results have better performance on false positive rate and accuracy than the average
    of all runs from CGED2018 for all three evaluation levels.

  abstract: Nowadays, more and more people are learning Chinese as their second language.
    Establishing an automatic diagnosis system for Chinese grammatical error has become
    an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a Chinese grammatical error
    diagnosis (CGED) model with contextualized character representation. Compared
    to the traditional model using LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory), our model have better
    performance and there is no need to add too many artificial features.

  abstract: Chinese grammatical error diagnosis is an important natural language processing
    (NLP) task, which is also an important application using artificial intelligence
    technology in language education. This paper introduces a system developed by
    the Chinese Multilingual & Multimodal Corpus and Big Data Research Center for
    the NLP-TEA shared task, named Chinese Grammar Error Diagnosis (CGED). This system
    regards diagnosing errors task as a sequence tagging problem, while takes correction
    task as a text classification problem. Finally, in the 12 teams, this system gets
    the highest F1 score in the detection task and the second highest F1 score in
    mean in the identification task, position task and the correction task.

  abstract: In the process of learning and using Chinese, many learners of Chinese
    as foreign language(CFL) may have grammar errors due to negative migration of
    their native languages. This paper introduces our system that can simultaneously
    diagnose four types of grammatical errors including redundant (R), missing (M),
    selection (S), disorder (W) in NLPTEA-5 shared task. We proposed a Bidirectional
    LSTM CRF neural network (BiLSTM-CRF) that combines BiLSTM and CRF without hand-craft
    features for Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED). Evaluation includes three
    levels, which are detection level, identification level and position level. At
    the detection level and identification level, our system got the third recall
    scores, and achieved good F1 values.

  abstract: This paper presents a method of combining Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
    model with a post-processing layer using Google n-grams statistical information
    tailored to detect word selection and word order errors made by learners of Chinese
    as Foreign Language (CFL). We describe the architecture of the model and its performance
    in the shared task of the ACL 2018 Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques
    for Educational Applications (NLPTEA). This hybrid approach yields comparably
    high false positive rate (FPR = 0.1274) and precision (Pd= 0.7519; Pi= 0.6311),
    but low recall (Rd = 0.3035; Ri = 0.1696 ) in grammatical error detection and
    identification tasks. Additional statistical information and linguistic rules
    can be added to enhance the model performance in the future.

  abstract: This paper reports how we build a Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis
    system in the NLPTEA-2018 CGED shared task. In 2018, we sent three runs with three
    different approaches. The first one is a pattern-based approach by frequent error
    pattern matching. The second one is a sequential labelling approach by conditional
    random fields (CRF). The third one is a rewriting approach by sequence to sequence
    (seq2seq) model. The three approaches have different properties that aim to optimize
    different performance metrics and the formal run results show the differences
    as we expected.

  abstract: The main goal of Chinese grammatical error diagnosis task is to detect
    word er-rors in the sentences written by Chinese-learning students. Our previous
    system would generate error-corrected sentences as candidates and their sentence
    likeli-hood were measured based on a large scale Chinese n-gram dataset. This
    year we further tried to identify long frequent-ly-seen subsentences and label
    them as correct in order to avoid propose too many error candidates. Two new methods
    for suggesting missing and selection er-rors were also tested.

  abstract: This paper presents a neural net approach to determine Semantic Textual
    Similarity (STS) using attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks
    (Bi-LSTM). To this date, most of the traditional STS systems were rule-based that
    built on top of excessive use of linguistic features and resources. In this paper,
    we present an end-to-end attention-based Bi-LSTM neural network system that solely
    takes word-level features, without expensive feature engineering work or the usage
    of external resources. By comparing its performance with traditional rule-based
    systems against SemEval-2012 benchmark, we make an assessment on the limitations
    and strengths of neural net systems to rule-based systems on Semantic Textual
    Similarity.

  abstract: 'This paper shows how a Lexicon-Grammar dictionary of English phrasal
    verbs (PV) can be transformed into an electronic dictionary, and with the help
    of multiple grammars, dictionaries, and filters within the linguistic development
    environment, NooJ, how to accurately identify PV in large corpora. The NooJ program
    is an alternative to statistical methods commonly used in NLP: all PV are listed
    in a dictionary and then located by means of a PV grammar in both continuous and
    discontinuous format. Results are then refined with a series of dictionaries,
    disambiguating grammars, and other linguistics recourses. The main advantage of
    such a program is that all PV can be identified in any corpus. The only drawback
    is that PV not listed in the dictionary (e.g., archaic forms, recent neologisms)
    are not identified; however, new PV can easily be added to the electronic dictionary,
    which is freely available to all.'

  abstract: The paper focusses on derivationally connected verbs in Croatian, i.e.
    on verbs that share the same lexical morpheme and are derived from other verbs
    via prefixation, suffixation and/or stem alternations. As in other Slavic languages
    with rich derivational morphology, each verb is marked for aspect, either perfective
    or imperfective. Some verbs, mostly of foreign origin, are marked as bi-aspectual
    verbs. The main objective of this paper is to detect and to describe major derivational
    processes and affixes used in the derivation of aspectually connected verbs with
    NooJ. Annotated chains are exported into a format adequate for web database system
    and further used to enhance the aspectual and derivational information for each
    verb.

  abstract: "This paper presents a rule-based system for disambiguating frensh locative\
    \ verbs and their translation to Arabic language. The disambiguation phase is\
    \ based on the use of the French Verb dictionary (LVF) of Dubois and Dubois Charlier\
    \ as a linguistic resource, from which a base of disambiguation rules is extracted.\
    \ The extracted rules thus take the form of transducers which will be subsequently\
    \ applied to texts. The translation phase consists in translating the disambiguated\
    \ locative verbs returned by the disambiguation phase. The translation takes into\
    \ account the verb\u2019s tense used as well as the inflected form of the verb.\
    \ This phase is based on bilingual dictionaries that contain the different French\
    \ locative verbs and their translation into the Arabic language. The experimentation\
    \ and the evaluation are done in the linguistic platform NooJ. The obtained results\
    \ are satisfactory."

  abstract: "In this paper, a pedagogical application of NooJ to the teaching and\
    \ learning of Spanish as a foreign language is presented, which is directed to\
    \ a specific addressee: learners whose mother tongue is Italian. The category\
    \ \u2018adjective\u2019 has been chosen on account of its lower frequency of occurrence\
    \ in texts written in Spanish, and particularly in the Argentine Rioplatense variety,\
    \ and with the aim of developing strategies to increase its use. In addition,\
    \ the features that the adjective shares with other grammatical categories render\
    \ it extremely productive and provide elements that enrich the learners\u2019\
    \ proficiency. The reference corpus contains the front pages of the Argentinian\
    \ newspaper Clar\xEDn related to an emblematic historical moment, whose starting\
    \ point is 24 March 1976, when a military coup began, and covers a thirty year\
    \ period until 24 March 2006. It can be seen how the term desaparecido emerges\
    \ with all its cultural and social charge, providing a context which allows an\
    \ approach to Rioplatense Spanish from a more comprehensive perspective. Finally,\
    \ a pedagogical proposal accounting for the application of the NooJ platform in\
    \ language teaching is included."

  abstract: We describe a resource derived through extraction of a set of argument
    realizations from an existing lexical-conceptual structure (LCS) Verb Database
    of 500 verb classes (containing a total of 9525 verb entries) to include information
    about realization of arguments for a range of different verb classes. We demonstrate
    that our extended resource, called STYLUS (SysTematicallY Derived Language USe),
    enables systematic derivation of regular patterns of language usage without requiring
    manual annotation. We posit that both spatially oriented applications such as
    robot navigation and more general applications such as narrative generation require
    a layered representation scheme where a set of primitives (often grounded in space/motion
    such as GO) is coupled with a representation of constraints at the syntax-semantics
    interface. We demonstrate that the resulting resource covers three cases of lexico-semantic
    operations applicable to both language understanding and language generation.

    tagged for morpho-syntactic information. Texts are collected from 25,199 documents
    from different domains and about 24 million orthographic words are tokenized.
    Since it is partly a web corpus, we made some automatic spelling error correction.
    We have also modified the existing morphological analyzer, HornMorpho, to use
    it for the automatic tagging.

  abstract: "Most extractive summarization techniques operate by ranking all the source\
    \ sentences and then select the top ranked sentences as the summary. Such methods\
    \ are known to produce good summaries, especially when applied to news articles\
    \ and scientific texts. However, they don\u2019t fare so well when applied to\
    \ texts such as fictional narratives, which don\u2019t have a single central or\
    \ recurrent theme. This is because usually the information or plot of the story\
    \ is spread across several sentences. In this paper, we discuss a different summarization\
    \ technique called Telegraphic Summarization. Here, we don\u2019t select whole\
    \ sentences, rather pick short segments of text spread across sentences, as the\
    \ summary. We have tailored a set of guidelines to create such summaries and,\
    \ using the same, annotate a gold corpus of 200 English short stories."

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian
    Languages: Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Geez. To check the usability
    of all the corpora we conducted baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation
    (SMT) experiments for seven language pairs. The performance of the bi-directional
    SMT systems shows that all the corpora can be used for further investigations.
    We have also shown that the morphological complexity of the Ethio-Semitic languages
    has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially when they are target
    languages. Based on the results we obtained, we are currently working towards
    handling the morphological complexities to improve the performance of statistical
    machine translation among the Ethiopian languages.'

  abstract: "Much interest in Frame Semantics is fueled by the substantial extent\
    \ of its applicability across languages. At the same time, lexicographic studies\
    \ have found that the applicability of individual frames can be diminished by\
    \ cross-lingual divergences regarding polysemy, syntactic valency, and lexicalization.\
    \ Due to the large effort involved in manual investigations, there are so far\
    \ no broad-coverage resources with \u201Cproblematic\u201D frames for any language\
    \ pair. Our study investigates to what extent multilingual vector representations\
    \ of frames learned from manually annotated corpora can address this need by serving\
    \ as a wide coverage source for such divergences. We present a case study for\
    \ the language pair English \u2014 German using the FrameNet and SALSA corpora\
    \ and find that inferences can be made about cross-lingual frame applicability\
    \ using a vector space model."

  abstract: Translation relations, which distinguish literal translation from other
    translation techniques, constitute an important subject of study for human translators
    (Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). However, automatic processing techniques based on
    interlingual relations, such as machine translation or paraphrase generation exploiting
    translational equivalence, have not exploited these relations explicitly until
    now. In this work, we present a categorisation of translation relations and annotate
    them in a parallel multilingual (English, French, Chinese) corpus of oral presentations,
    the TED Talks. Our long term objective will be to automatically detect these relations
    in order to integrate them as important characteristics for the search of monolingual
    segments in relation of equivalence (paraphrases) or of entailment. The annotated
    corpus resulting from our work will be made available to the community.

  abstract: We work on improving the Cesselin, a large and open source Japanese-French
    bilingual dictionary digitalized by OCR, available on the web, and contributively
    improvable online. Labelling its examples (about 226000) would significantly enhance
    their usefulness for language learners. Examples are proverbs, idiomatic constructions,
    normal usage examples, and, for nouns, phrases containing a quantifier. Proverbs
    are easy to spot, but not examples of other types. To find a method for automatically
    or at least semi-automatically annotating them, we have studied many entries,
    and hypothesized that the degree of lexical similarity between results of MT into
    a third language might give good cues. To confirm that hypothesis, we sampled
    500 examples and used Google Translate to translate into English their Japanese
    expressions and their French translations. The hypothesis holds well, in particular
    for distinguishing examples of normal usage from idiomatic examples. Finally,
    we propose a detailed annotation procedure and discuss its future automatization.

  abstract: "This paper performs a detailed analysis on the alignment of Portuguese\
    \ contractions, based on a previously aligned bilingual corpus. The alignment\
    \ task was performed manually in a subset of the English-Portuguese CLUE4Translation\
    \ Alignment Collection. The initial parallel corpus was pre-processed and, a decision\
    \ was made as to whether the contraction should be maintained or decomposed in\
    \ the alignment. Decomposition was required in the cases in which the two words\
    \ that have been concatenated, i.e., the preposition and the determiner or pronoun,\
    \ go in two separate translation alignment pairs (e.g., [no seio de] [a Uni\xE3\
    o Europeia] | [within] [the European Union]). Most contractions required decomposition\
    \ in contexts where they are positioned at the end of a multiword unit. On the\
    \ other hand, contractions tend to be maintained when they occur in the beginning\
    \ or in the middle of the multiword unit, i.e., in the frozen part of the multiword\
    \ (e.g., [no que diz respeito a] | [with regard to] or [al\xE9m disso] [in addition].\
    \ A correct alignment of multiwords and phrasal units containing contractions\
    \ is instrumental for machine translation, paraphrasing, and variety adaptation."

  abstract: Code-mixing, use of two or more languages in a single sentence, is ubiquitous;
    generated by multi-lingual speakers across the world. The phenomenon presents
    itself prominently in social media discourse. Consequently, there is a growing
    need for translating code-mixed hybrid language into standard languages. However,
    due to the lack of gold parallel data, existing machine translation systems fail
    to properly translate code-mixed text. In an effort to initiate the task of machine
    translation of code-mixed content, we present a newly created parallel corpus
    of code-mixed English-Hindi and English. We selected previously available English-Hindi
    code-mixed data as a starting point for the creation of our parallel corpus. We
    then chose 4 human translators, fluent in both English and Hindi, for translating
    the 6088 code-mixed English-Hindi sentences to English. With the help of the created
    parallel corpus, we analyzed the structure of English-Hindi code-mixed data and
    present a technique to augment run-of-the-mill machine translation (MT) approaches
    that can help achieve superior translations without the need for specially designed
    translation systems. We present an augmentation pipeline for existing MT approaches,
    like Phrase Based MT (Moses) and Neural MT, to improve the translation of code-mixed
    text. The augmentation pipeline is presented as a pre-processing step and can
    be plugged with any existing MT system, which we demonstrate by improving translations
    done by systems like Moses, Google Neural Machine Translation System (NMTS) and
    Bing Translator for English-Hindi code-mixed content.

  abstract: 'Text normalization is the task of mapping non-canonical language, typical
    of speech transcription and computer-mediated communication, to a standardized
    writing. It is an up-stream task necessary to enable the subsequent direct employment
    of standard natural language processing tools and indispensable for languages
    such as Swiss German, with strong regional variation and no written standard.
    Text normalization has been addressed with a variety of methods, most successfully
    with character-level statistical machine translation (CSMT). In the meantime,
    machine translation has changed and the new methods, known as neural encoder-decoder
    (ED) models, resulted in remarkable improvements. Text normalization, however,
    has not yet followed. A number of neural methods have been tried, but CSMT remains
    the state-of-the-art. In this work, we normalize Swiss German WhatsApp messages
    using the ED framework. We exploit the flexibility of this framework, which allows
    us to learn from the same training data in different ways. In particular, we modify
    the decoding stage of a plain ED model to include target-side language models
    operating at different levels of granularity: characters and words. Our systematic
    comparison shows that our approach results in an improvement over the CSMT state-of-the-art.'

  abstract: False friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but
    have different meanings. They are a common source of confusion among language
    learners. Methods to detect them automatically do exist, however they make use
    of large aligned bilingual corpora, which are hard to find and expensive to build,
    or encounter problems dealing with infrequent words. In this work we propose a
    high coverage method that uses word vector representations to build a false friends
    classifier for any pair of languages, which we apply to the particular case of
    Spanish and Portuguese. The required resources are a large corpus for each language
    and a small bilingual lexicon for the pair.

  abstract: This paper presents the submission of the UH&CU team (Joint University
    of Colorado and University of Helsinki team) for the VarDial 2018 shared task
    on morphosyntactic tagging of Croatian, Slovenian and Serbian tweets. Our system
    is a bidirectional LSTM tagger which emits tags as character sequences using an
    LSTM generator in order to be able to handle unknown tags and combinations of
    several tags for one token which occur in the shared task data sets. To the best
    of our knowledge, using an LSTM generator is a novel approach. The system delivers
    sizable improvements of more than 6%-points over a baseline trigram tagger. Overall,
    the performance of our system is quite even for all three languages.

  abstract: Luyia is a macrolanguage in central Kenya. The Luyia languages, like other
    Bantu languages, have a complex morphological system. This system can be leveraged
    to aid in part of speech tagging. Bag-of-characters taggers trained on a source
    Luyia language can be applied directly to another Luyia language with some degree
    of success. In addition, mixing data from the target language with data from the
    source language does produce more accurate predictive models compared to models
    trained on just the target language data when the training set size is small.
    However, for both of these tagging tasks, models involving the more distantly
    related language, Tiriki, are better at predicting part of speech tags for Wanga
    data. The models incorporating Bukusu data are not as successful despite the closer
    relationship between Bukusu and Wanga. Overlapping vocabulary between the Wanga
    and Tiriki corpora as well as a bias towards open class words help Tiriki outperform
    Bukusu.

  abstract: This paper describes our systems for the VarDial 2018 evaluation campaign.
    We participated in all language identification tasks, namely, Arabic dialect identification
    (ADI), German dialect identification (GDI), discriminating between Dutch and Flemish
    in Subtitles (DFS), and Indo-Aryan Language Identification (ILI). In all of the
    tasks, we only used textual transcripts (not using audio features for ADI). We
    submitted system runs based on support vector machine classifiers (SVMs) with
    bag of character and word n-grams as features, and gated bidirectional recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) using units of characters and words. Our SVM models outperformed
    our RNN models in all tasks, obtaining the first place on the DFS task, third
    place on the ADI task, and second place on others according to the official rankings.
    As well as describing the models we used in the shared task participation, we
    present an analysis of the n-gram features used by the SVM models in each task,
    and also report additional results (that were run after the official competition
    deadline) on the GDI surprise dialect track.

  abstract: We present a machine learning approach that ranked on the first place
    in the Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) Closed Shared Tasks of the 2018 VarDial
    Evaluation Campaign. The proposed approach combines several kernels using multiple
    kernel learning. While most of our kernels are based on character p-grams (also
    known as n-grams) extracted from speech or phonetic transcripts, we also use a
    kernel based on dialectal embeddings generated from audio recordings by the organizers.
    In the learning stage, we independently employ Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA)
    and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). Preliminary experiments indicate that KRR provides
    better classification results. Our approach is shallow and simple, but the empirical
    results obtained in the 2018 ADI Closed Shared Task prove that it achieves the
    best performance. Furthermore, our top macro-F1 score (58.92%) is significantly
    better than the second best score (57.59%) in the 2018 ADI Shared Task, according
    to the statistical significance test performed by the organizers. Nevertheless,
    we obtain even better post-competition results (a macro-F1 score of 62.28%) using
    the audio embeddings released by the organizers after the competition. With a
    very similar approach (that did not include phonetic features), we also ranked
    first in the ADI Closed Shared Tasks of the 2017 VarDial Evaluation Campaign,
    surpassing the second best method by 4.62%. We therefore conclude that our multiple
    kernel learning method is the best approach to date for Arabic dialect identification.

  abstract: Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated
    on written image descriptions. At the same time, these systems are often used
    to provide spoken descriptions (e.g. for visually impaired users) through apps
    like TapTapSee or Seeing AI. This is not a problem, as long as spoken and written
    descriptions are very similar. However, linguistic research suggests that spoken
    language often differs from written language. These differences are not regular,
    and vary from context to context. Therefore, this paper investigates whether there
    are differences between written and spoken image descriptions, even if they are
    elicited through similar tasks. We compare descriptions produced in two languages
    (English and Dutch), and in both languages observe substantial differences between
    spoken and written descriptions. Future research should see if users prefer the
    spoken over the written style and, if so, aim to emulate spoken descriptions.

  abstract: Automatic speech recognition and spoken dialogue systems have made great
    advances through the use of deep machine learning methods. This is partly due
    to greater computing power but also through the large amount of data available
    in common languages, such as English. Conversely, research in minority languages,
    including sign languages, is hampered by the severe lack of data. This has led
    to work on transfer learning methods, whereby a model developed for one language
    is reused as the starting point for a model on a second language, which is less
    resourced. In this paper, we examine two transfer learning techniques of fine-tuning
    and layer substitution for language modelling of British Sign Language. Our results
    show improvement in perplexity when using transfer learning with standard stacked
    LSTM models, trained initially using a large corpus for standard English from
    the Penn Treebank corpus.

    \ a gente\u201D versus \u201Ctodo o mundo\u201D \u2018everybody\u2019 or the gerundive\

    \ which are extremely relevant to high quality paraphrasing. The variants were\
    \ manually aligned in the e-PACT corpus, using the CLUE-Aligner tool. The methodology,\
    \ inspired in the Logos Model, focuses on a semantico-syntactic analysis of each\

    \ i.e., for dealing with the cultural, linguistic and stylistic differences between\
    \ them, making it possible to convert texts (semi-)automatically from one variety\
    \ into another, a key function in paraphrasing systems. This topic represents\
    \ an interesting new line of research with valuable applications in language learning,\

    \ among others. The paraphrastic units are the first resource of its kind for\

  abstract: 'SYSTRAN competes this year for the first time to the DSL shared task,
    in the Arabic Dialect Identification subtask. We participate by training several
    Neural Network models showing that we can obtain competitive results despite the
    limited amount of training data available for learning. We report our experiments
    and detail the network architecture and parameters of our 3 runs: our best performing
    system consists in a Multi-Input CNN that learns separate embeddings for lexical,
    phonetic and acoustic input features (F1: 0.5289); we also built a CNN-biLSTM
    network aimed at capturing both spatial and sequential features directly from
    speech spectrograms (F1: 0.3894 at submission time, F1: 0.4235 with later found
    parameters); and finally a system relying on binary CNN-biLSTMs (F1: 0.4339).'

  abstract: 'The objective of this work is to quantify, with a simple and robust measure,
    the distance between historical varieties of a language. The measure will be inferred
    from text corpora corresponding to historical periods. Different approaches have
    been proposed for similar aims: Language Identification, Phylogenetics, Historical
    Linguistics or Dialectology. In our approach, we used a perplexity-based measure
    to calculate language distance between all the historical periods of a specific
    language: European Portuguese. Perplexity has also proven to be a robust metric
    to calculate distance between languages. However, this measure has not been tested
    yet to identify diachronic periods within the historical evolution of a specific
    language. For this purpose, a historical Portuguese corpus has been constructed
    from different open sources containing texts with close original spelling. The
    results of our experiments show that Portuguese keeps an important degree of homogeneity
    over time. We anticipate this metric to be a starting point to be applied to other
    languages.'

  abstract: This paper presents two systems taking part in the Morphosyntactic Tagging
    of Tweets shared task on Slovene, Croatian and Serbian data, organized inside
    the VarDial Evaluation Campaign. While one system relies on the traditional method
    for sequence labeling (conditional random fields), the other relies on its neural
    alternative (bidirectional long short-term memory). We investigate the similarities
    and differences of these two approaches, showing that both methods yield very
    good and quite similar results, with the neural model outperforming the traditional
    one more as the level of non-standardness of the text increases. Through an error
    analysis we show that the neural system is better at long-range dependencies,
    while the traditional system excels and slightly outperforms the neural system
    at the local ones. We present in the paper new state-of-the-art results in morphosyntactic
    annotation of non-standard text for Slovene, Croatian and Serbian.

  abstract: The present contribution revolves around efficient approaches to language
    classification which have been field-tested in the Vardial evaluation campaign.
    The methods used in several language identification tasks comprising different
    language types are presented and their results are discussed, giving insights
    on real-world application of regularization, linear classifiers and corresponding
    linguistic features. The use of a specially adapted Ridge classifier proved useful
    in 2 tasks out of 3. The overall approach (XAC) has slightly outperformed most
    of the other systems on the DFS task (Dutch and Flemish) and on the ILI task (Indo-Aryan
    languages), while its comparative performance was poorer in on the GDI task (Swiss
    German dialects).

  abstract: Text language Identification is a Natural Language Processing task of
    identifying and recognizing a given language out of many different languages from
    a piece of text. This paper describes our submission to the ILI 2018 shared-task,
    which includes the identification of 5 closely related Indo-Aryan languages. We
    developed a word-level LSTM(Long Short-term Memory) model, a specific type of
    Recurrent Neural Network model, for this task. Given a sentence, our model embeds
    each word of the sentence and convert into its trainable word embedding, feeds
    them into our LSTM network and finally predict the language. We obtained an F1
    macro score of 0.836, ranking 5th in the task.

  abstract: With the goal of discovering differences between Belgian and Netherlandic
    Dutch, we participated as Team Taurus in the Dutch-Flemish Subtitles task of VarDial2018.
    We used a rather simple marker-based method, but a wide range of features, including
    lexical, lexico-syntactic and syntactic ones, and achieved a second position in
    the ranking. Inspection of highly distin-guishing features did point towards differences
    between the two language varieties, but because of the nature of the experimental
    data, we have to treat our observations as very tentative and in need of further
    investigation.

    ADI VarDial 2018 data consists of 16,157 utterances, their words transcription,
    their phonetic transcriptions obtained with four non-Arabic phoneme recognizers
    and acoustic embedding data. Our overall system is a combination of four different
    systems. One system uses the words transcriptions and tries to recognize the speaker
    dialect by modeling the sequence of words for each dialect. Another system tries
    to recognize the dialect by modeling the phones sequence produced by non-Arabic
    phone recognizers, whereas, the other two systems use GMM trained on the acoustic
    features for recognizing the dialect. The best performance was achieved by the
    fused system which combines four systems together, with F1 micro of 68.77%.

  abstract: We describe our approaches used in the German Dialect Identification (GDI)
    task at the VarDial Evaluation Campaign 2018. The goal was to identify to which
    out of four dialects spoken in German speaking part of Switzerland a sentence
    belonged to. We adopted two different meta classifier approaches and used some
    data mining insights to improve the preprocessing and the meta classifier parameters.
    Especially, we focused on using different feature extraction methods and how to
    combine them, since they influenced very differently the performance of the system.
    Our system achieved second place out of 8 teams, with a macro averaged F-1 of
    64.6%.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe a morpho-syntactic tagger of tweets, an important
    component of the CEA List DeepLIMA tool which is a multilingual text analysis
    platform based on deep learning. This tagger is built for the Morpho-syntactic
    Tagging of Tweets (MTT) Shared task of the 2018 VarDial Evaluation Campaign. The
    MTT task focuses on morpho-syntactic annotation of non-canonical Twitter varieties
    of three South-Slavic languages: Slovene, Croatian and Serbian. We propose to
    use a neural network model trained in an end-to-end manner for the three languages
    without any need for task or domain specific features engineering. The proposed
    approach combines both character and word level representations. Considering the
    lack of annotated data in the social media domain for South-Slavic languages,
    we have also implemented a cross-domain Transfer Learning (TL) approach to exploit
    any available related out-of-domain annotated data.'

    between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles VarDial 2018 shared task. We try techniques
    proven to work well for discriminating between language varieties as well as explore
    the potential of using syntactic features, i.e. hierarchical syntactic subtrees.
    We experiment with different combinations of features. Discriminating between
    these two languages turned out to be a very hard task, not only for a machine:
    human performance is only around 0.51 F1 score; our best system is still a simple
    Naive Bayes model with word unigrams and bigrams. The system achieved an F1 score
    (macro) of 0.62, which ranked us 4th in the shared task.'

  abstract: In this paper we present the experiments and results by the SUKI team
    in the German Dialect Identification shared task of the VarDial 2018 Evaluation
    Campaign. Our submission using HeLI with adaptive language models obtained the
    best results in the shared task with a macro F1-score of 0.686, which is clearly
    higher than the other submitted results. Without some form of unsupervised adaptation
    on the test set, it might not be possible to reach as high an F1-score with the
    level of domain difference between the datasets of the shared task. We describe
    the methods used in detail, as well as some additional experiments carried out
    during the shared task.

  abstract: The Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011) is
    a large-scale repos-itory of Arabic dialects with manual labels for4varieties
    of the language. Existing dialect iden-tification models exploiting the dataset
    pre-date the recent boost deep learning brought to NLPand hence the data are not
    benchmarked for use with deep learning, nor is it clear how much neural networks
    can help tease the categories in the data apart. We treat these two limitations:We
    (1) benchmark the data, and (2) empirically test6different deep learning methods
    on thetask, comparing peformance to several classical machine learning models
    under different condi-tions (i.e., both binary and multi-way classification).
    Our experimental results show that variantsof (attention-based) bidirectional
    recurrent neural networks achieve best accuracy (acc) on thetask, significantly
    outperforming all competitive baselines. On blind test data, our models reach87.65%acc
    on the binary task (MSA vs. dialects),87.4%acc on the 3-way dialect task (Egyptianvs.
    Gulf vs. Levantine), and82.45%acc on the 4-way variants task (MSA vs. Egyptian
    vs. Gulfvs. Levantine). We release our benchmark for future work on the dataset

  abstract: In this paper we present the first neural-based machine translation system
    trained to translate between standard national varieties of the same language.
    We take the pair Brazilian - European Portuguese as an example and compare the
    performance of this method to a phrase-based statistical machine translation system.
    We report a performance improvement of 0.9 BLEU points in translating from European
    to Brazilian Portuguese and 0.2 BLEU points when translating in the opposite direction.
    We also carried out a human evaluation experiment with native speakers of Brazilian
    Portuguese which indicates that humans prefer the output produced by the neural-based
    system in comparison to the statistical system.

  abstract: The goal of our industrial ticketing system is to retrieve a relevant
    solution for an input query, by matching with historical tickets stored in knowledge
    base. A query is comprised of subject and description, while a historical ticket
    consists of subject, description and solution. To retrieve a relevant solution,
    we use textual similarity paradigm to learn similarity in the query and historical
    tickets. The task is challenging due to significant term mismatch in the query
    and ticket pairs of asymmetric lengths, where subject is a short text but description
    and solution are multi-sentence texts. We present a novel Replicated Siamese LSTM
    model to learn similarity in asymmetric text pairs, that gives 22% and 7% gain
    (Accuracy@10) for retrieval task, respectively over unsupervised and supervised
    baselines. We also show that the topic and distributed semantic features for short
    and long texts improved both similarity learning and retrieval.

  abstract: "In this study, we develop content features for an automated scoring system\
    \ of non-native English speakers\u2019 spontaneous speech. The features calculate\
    \ the lexical similarity between the question text and the ASR word hypothesis\
    \ of the spoken response, based on traditional word vector models or word embeddings.\
    \ The proposed features do not require any sample training responses for each\
    \ question, and this is a strong advantage since collecting question-specific\
    \ data is an expensive task, and sometimes even impossible due to concerns about\
    \ question exposure. We explore the impact of these new features on the automated\
    \ scoring of two different question types: (a) providing opinions on familiar\
    \ topics and (b) answering a question about a stimulus material. The proposed\
    \ features showed statistically significant correlations with the oral proficiency\
    \ scores, and the combination of new features with the speech-driven features\
    \ achieved a small but significant further improvement for the latter question\
    \ type. Further analyses suggested that the new features were effective in assigning\
    \ more accurate scores for responses with serious content issues."

  abstract: Automatically learnt word sense embeddings are developed as an attempt
    to refine the capabilities of coarse word embeddings. The word sense representations
    obtained this way are, however, sensitive to underlying corpora and parameterizations,
    and they might be difficult to relate to formally defined word senses. We propose
    to tackle this problem by devising a mechanism to establish links between word
    sense embeddings and lexical resources created by experts. We evaluate the applicability
    of these links in a task to retrieve instances of word sense unlisted in the lexicon.

  abstract: Existing NLP models are mostly trained with data from well-resourced languages.
    Most minority languages face the challenge of lack of resources - data and technologies
    - for NLP research. Building these resources from scratch for each minority language
    will be very expensive, time-consuming and amount largely to unnecessarily re-inventing
    the wheel. In this paper, we applied transfer learning techniques to create Igbo
    word embeddings from a variety of existing English trained embeddings. Transfer
    learning methods were also used to build standard datasets for Igbo word similarity
    and analogy tasks for intrinsic evaluation of embeddings. These projected embeddings
    were also applied to diacritic restoration task. Our results indicate that the
    projected models not only outperform the trained ones on the semantic-based tasks
    of analogy, word-similarity, and odd-word identifying, but they also achieve enhanced
    performance on the diacritic restoration with learned diacritic embeddings.

  abstract: Entity embeddings are vector space representations of a given domain of
    interest. They are typically learned from text corpora (possibly in combination
    with any available structured knowledge), based on the intuition that similar
    entities should be represented by similar vectors. The usefulness of such entity
    embeddings largely stems from the fact that they implicitly encode a rich amount
    of knowledge about the considered domain, beyond mere similarity. In an embedding
    of movies, for instance, we may expect all movies from a given genre to be located
    in some low-dimensional manifold. This is particularly useful in supervised learning
    settings, where it may e.g. allow neural movie recommenders to base predictions
    on the genre of a movie, without that genre having to be specified explicitly
    for each movie, or without even the need to specify that the genre of a movie
    is a property that may have predictive value for the considered task. In unsupervised
    settings, however, such implicitly encoded knowledge cannot be leveraged. Conceptual
    spaces, as proposed by Grdenfors, are similar to entity embeddings, but provide
    more structure. In conceptual spaces, among others, dimensions are interpretable
    and grouped into facets, and properties and concepts are explicitly modelled as
    (vague) regions. Thanks to this additional structure, conceptual spaces can be
    used as a knowledge representation framework, which can also be effectively exploited
    in unsupervised settings. Given a conceptual space of movies, for instance, we
    are able to answer queries that ask about similarity w.r.t. a particular facet
    (e.g. movies which are cinematographically similar to Jurassic Park), that refer
    to a given feature (e.g. movies which are scarier than Jurassic Park but otherwise
    similar), or that refer to particular properties or concepts (e.g. thriller from
    the 1990s with a dinosaur theme). Compared to standard entity embeddings, however,
    conceptual spaces are more challenging to learn in a purely data-driven fashion.
    In this talk, I will give an overview of some approaches for learning such representations
    that have recently been developed within the context of the FLEXILOG project.

  abstract: "These days, most general knowledge question-answering systems rely on\
    \ large-scale knowledge bases comprising billions of facts about millions of entities.\
    \ Having a structured source of semantic knowledge means that we can answer questions\
    \ involving single static facts (e.g. \u201CWho was the 8th president of the US?\u201D\
    ) or dynamically generated ones (e.g. \u201CHow old is Donald Trump?\u201D). More\
    \ importantly, we can answer questions involving multiple inference steps (\u201C\
    Is the queen older than the president of the US?\u201D). In this talk, I\u2019\
    m going to be discussing some of the unique challenges that are involved with\
    \ building and maintaining a consistent knowledge base for Alexa, extending it\
    \ with new facts and using it to serve answers in multiple languages. I will focus\
    \ on three recent projects from our group. First, a way of measuring the completeness\
    \ of a knowledge base, that is based on usage patterns. The definition of the\
    \ usage of the KB is done in terms of the relation distribution of entities seen\
    \ in question-answer logs. Instead of directly estimating the relation distribution\
    \ of individual entities, it is generalized to the \u201Cclass signature\u201D\
    \ of each entity. For example, users ask for baseball players\u2019 height, age,\
    \ and batting average, so a knowledge base is complete (with respect to baseball\
    \ players) if every entity has facts for those three relations. Second, an investigation\
    \ into fact extraction from unstructured text. I will present a method for creating\
    \ distant (weak) supervision labels for training a large-scale relation extraction\
    \ system. I will also discuss the effectiveness of neural network approaches by\
    \ decoupling the model architecture from the feature design of a state-of-the-art\
    \ neural network system. Surprisingly, a much simpler classifier trained on similar\
    \ features performs on par with the highly complex neural network system (at 75x\
    \ reduction to the training time), suggesting that the features are a bigger contributor\
    \ to the final performance. Finally, I will present the Fact Extraction and VERification\
    \ (FEVER) dataset and challenge. The dataset comprises more than 185,000 human-generated\
    \ claims extracted from Wikipedia pages. False claims were generated by mutating\
    \ true claims in a variety of ways, some of which were meaningaltering. During\
    \ the verification step, annotators were required to label a claim for its validity\
    \ and also supply full-sentence textual evidence from (potentially multiple) Wikipedia\
    \ articles for the label. With FEVER, we aim to help create a new generation of\
    \ transparent and interprable knowledge extraction systems."

  abstract: We propose a compositional Bayesian semantics that interprets declarative
    sentences in a natural language by assigning them probability conditions. These
    are conditional probabilities that estimate the likelihood that a competent speaker
    would endorse an assertion, given certain hypotheses. Our semantics is implemented
    in a functional programming language. It estimates the marginal probability of
    a sentence through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of objects in vector
    space models satisfying specified hypotheses. We apply our semantics to examples
    with several predicates and generalised quantifiers, including higher-order quantifiers.
    It captures the vagueness of predication (both gradable and non-gradable), without
    positing a precise boundary for classifier application. We present a basic account
    of semantic learning based on our semantic system. We compare our proposal to
    other current theories of probabilistic semantics, and we show that it offers
    several important advantages over these accounts.

  abstract: "Natural language processing researchers have proven the ability of machine\
    \ learning approaches to detect depression-related cues from language; however,\
    \ to date, these efforts have primarily assumed it was acceptable to leave depression-related\
    \ texts in the data. Our concerns with this are twofold: first, that the models\
    \ may be overfitting on depression-related signals, which may not be present in\
    \ all depressed users (only those who talk about depression on social media);\
    \ and second, that these models would under-perform for users who are sensitive\
    \ to the public stigma of depression. This study demonstrates the validity to\
    \ those concerns. We construct a novel corpus of texts from 12,106 Reddit users\
    \ and perform lexical and predictive analyses under two conditions: one where\
    \ all text produced by the users is included and one where the depression data\
    \ is withheld. We find significant differences in the language used by depressed\
    \ users under the two conditions as well as a difference in the ability of machine\
    \ learning algorithms to correctly detect depression. However, despite the lexical\
    \ differences and reduced classification performance\u2013each of which suggests\
    \ that users may be able to fool algorithms by avoiding direct discussion of depression\u2013\
    a still respectable overall performance suggests lexical models are reasonably\
    \ robust and well suited for a role in a diagnostic or monitoring capacity."

  abstract: Arabic Broken Plurals show an interesting phenomenon in Arabic morphology
    as they are formed by shifting the consonants of the syllables into different
    syllable patterns, and subsequently, the pattern of the word changes. The present
    paper, therefore, attempts to look at Arabic broken plurals from the perspective
    of neural networks by implementing an OpenNMT experiment to better understand
    and interpret the behavior of these plurals, especially when it comes to L2 acquisition.
    The results show that the model is successful in predicting the Arabic template.
    However, it fails to predict certain consonants such as the emphatics and the
    gutturals. This reinforces the fact that these consonants or sounds are the most
    difficult for L2 learners to acquire.

  abstract: Ever increasing ransomware attacks and thefts of intellectual property
    demand cybersecurity solutions to protect critical documents. One emerging solution
    is to place fake text documents in the repository of critical documents for deceiving
    and catching cyber attackers. We can generate fake text documents by obscuring
    the salient information in legit text documents. However, the obscuring process
    can result in linguistic inconsistencies, such as broken co-references and illogical
    flow of ideas across the sentences, which can discern the fake document and render
    it unbelievable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate believable
    fake text documents by automatically improving the linguistic consistency of computer-generated
    fake text. Our method focuses on enhancing syntactic cohesion and semantic coherence
    across discourse segments. We conduct experiments with human subjects to evaluate
    the effect of believability improvements in distinguishing legit texts from fake
    texts. Results show that the probability to distinguish legit texts from believable
    fake texts is consistently lower than from fake texts that have not been improved
    in believability. This indicates the effectiveness of our method in generating
    believable fake text.

  abstract: The Winograd Schema Challenge targets pronominal anaphora resolution problems
    which require the application of cognitive inference in combination with world
    knowledge. These problems are easy to solve for humans but most difficult to solve
    for machines. Computational models that previously addressed this task rely on
    syntactic preprocessing and incorporation of external knowledge by manually crafted
    features. We address the Winograd Schema Challenge from a new perspective as a
    sequence ranking task, and design a Siamese neural sequence ranking model which
    performs significantly better than a random baseline, even when solely trained
    on sequences of words. We evaluate against a baseline and a state-of-the-art system
    on two data sets and show that anonymization of noun phrase candidates strongly
    helps our model to generalize.

  abstract: Sentences with presuppositions are often treated as uninterpretable or
    unvalued (neither true nor false) if their presuppositions are not satisfied.
    However, there is an open question as to how this satisfaction is calculated.
    In some cases, determining whether a presupposition is satisfied is not a trivial
    task (or even a decidable one), yet native speakers are able to quickly and confidently
    identify instances of presupposition failure. I propose that this can be accounted
    for with a form of possible world semantics that encapsulates some reasoning abilities,
    but is limited in its computational power, thus circumventing the need to solve
    computationally difficult problems. This can be modeled using a variant of the
    framework of finite state semantics proposed by Rooth (2017). A few modifications
    to this system are necessary, including its extension into a three-valued logic
    to account for presupposition. Within this framework, the logic necessary to calculate
    presupposition satisfaction is readily available, but there is no risk of needing
    exceptional computational power. This correctly predicts that certain presuppositions
    will not be calculated intuitively, while others can be easily evaluated.

  abstract: This paper explores the correlations between key syntactic dependencies
    and the occurrence of simple spoken language disfluencies such as filled pauses
    and incomplete words. The working hypothesis here is that interruptions caused
    by these phenomena are more likely to happen between weakly connected words from
    a syntactic point of view than between strongly connected ones. The obtained results
    show significant patterns with the regard to key syntactic phenomena, like confirming
    the positive correlation between the frequency of disfluencies and multiples measures
    of syntactic complexity. In addition, they show that there is a stronger relationship
    between the verb and its subject than with its object, which confirms the idea
    of a hierarchical incrementality. Also, this work uncovered an interesting role
    played by a verb particle as a syntactic delimiter of some verb complements. Finally,
    the interruptions by disfluencies patterns show that verbs have a more privileged
    relationship with their preposition compared to the object Noun Phrase (NP).

  abstract: "Older adults tend to suffer a decline in some of their cognitive capabilities,\
    \ being language one of least affected processes. Word association norms (WAN)\
    \ also known as free word associations reflect word-word relations, the participant\
    \ reads or hears a word and is asked to write or say the first word that comes\
    \ to mind. Free word associations show how the organization of semantic memory\
    \ remains almost unchanged with age. We have performed a WAN task with very small\
    \ samples of older adults with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), vascular dementia\
    \ (VaD) and mixed dementia (MxD), and also with a control group of typical aging\
    \ adults, matched by age, sex and education. All of them are native speakers of\
    \ Mexican Spanish. The results show, as expected, that Alzheimer disease has a\
    \ very important impact in lexical retrieval, unlike vascular and mixed dementia.\
    \ This suggests that linguistic tests elaborated from WAN can be also used for\
    \ detecting AD at early stages."

  abstract: Censorship of Internet content in China is understood to operate through
    a system of intermediary liability whereby service providers are liable for the
    content on their platforms. Previous work studying censorship has found huge variability
    in the implementation of censorship across different products even within the
    same industry segment. In this work we explore the extent to which these censorship
    features are present in the open source projects of individual developers in China
    by collecting their blacklists and comparing their similarity. We collect files
    from a popular online code repository, extract lists of strings, and then classify
    whether each is a Chinese blacklist. Overall, we found over 1,000 Chinese blacklists
    comprising over 200,000 unique keywords, representing the largest dataset of Chinese
    blacklisted keywords to date. We found very little keyword overlap between lists,
    raising questions as to their origins, as the lists seem too large to have been
    individually curated, yet the lack of overlap suggests that they have no common
    source.

  abstract: People often create obfuscated language for online communication to avoid
    Internet censorship, share sensitive information, express strong sentiment or
    emotion, plan for secret actions, trade illegal products, or simply hold interesting
    conversations. In this position paper we systematically categorize human-created
    obfuscated language on various levels, investigate their basic mechanisms, give
    an overview on automated techniques needed to simulate human encoding. These encoders
    have potential to frustrate and evade, co-evolve with dynamic human or automated
    decoders, and produce interesting and adoptable code words. We also summarize
    remaining challenges for future research on the interaction between Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) and encryption, and leveraging NLP techniques for encoding and
    decoding.

  abstract: 'Most work within the computational event modeling community has tended
    to focus on the interpretation and ordering of events that are associated with
    verbs and event nominals in linguistic expressions. What is often overlooked in
    the construction of a global interpretation of a narrative is the role contributed
    by the objects participating in these structures, and the latent events and activities
    conventionally associated with them. Recently, the analysis of visual images has
    also enriched the scope of how events can be identified, by anchoring both linguistic
    expressions and ontological labels to segments, subregions, and properties of
    images. By semantically grounding event descriptions in their visualization, the
    importance of object-based attributes becomes more apparent. In this position
    paper, we look at the narrative structure of objects: that is, how objects reference
    events through their intrinsic attributes, such as affordances, purposes, and
    functions. We argue that, not only do objects encode conventionalized events,
    but that when they are composed within specific habitats, the ensemble can be
    viewed as modeling coherent event sequences, thereby enriching the global interpretation
    of the evolving narrative being constructed.'

  abstract: We present a rich annotation scheme for the structure of mental events.
    Mental events are those in which the verb describes a mental state or process,
    usually oriented towards an external situation. While physical events have been
    described in detail and there are numerous studies of their semantic analysis
    and annotation, mental events are less thoroughly studied. The annotation scheme
    proposed here is based on decompositional analyses in the semantic and typological
    linguistic literature. The scheme was applied to the news corpus from the 2016
    Events workshop, and error analysis of the test annotation provides suggestions
    for refinement and clarification of the annotation scheme.

  abstract: Cross-document event chain co-referencing in corpora of news articles
    would achieve increased precision and generalizability from a method that consistently
    recognizes narrative, discursive, and phenomenological features such as tense,
    mood, tone, canonicity and breach, person, hermeneutic composability, speed, and
    time. Current models that capture primarily linguistic data such as entities,
    times, and relations or causal relationships may only incidentally capture narrative
    framing features of events. That limits efforts at narrative and event chain segmentation,
    among other predicate tasks for narrative search and narrative-based reasoning.
    It further limits research on audience engagement with journalism about complex
    subjects. This position paper explores the above proposition with respect to narrative
    theory and ongoing research on segmenting event chains into narrative units. Our
    own work in progress approaches this task using event segmentation, word embeddings,
    and variable length pattern matching in a corpus of 2,000 articles describing
    environmental events. Our position is that narrative features may or may not be
    implicitly captured by current methods explicitly focused on events as linguistic
    phenomena, that they are not explicitly captured, and that further research is
    required.

  abstract: "Discourse structure is a key aspect of all forms of text, providing valuable\
    \ information both to humans and machines. We applied the hierarchical theory\
    \ of news discourse developed by van Dijk to examine how paragraphs operate as\
    \ units of discourse structure within news articles\u2014what we refer to here\
    \ as document-level discourse. This document-level discourse provides a characterization\
    \ of the content of each paragraph that describes its relation to the events presented\
    \ in the article (such as main events, backgrounds, and consequences) as well\
    \ as to other components of the story (such as commentary and evaluation). The\
    \ purpose of a news discourse section is of great utility to story understanding\
    \ as it affects both the importance and temporal order of items introduced in\
    \ the text\u2014therefore, if we know the news discourse purpose for different\
    \ sections, we should be able to better rank events for their importance and better\
    \ construct timelines. We test two hypotheses: first, that people can reliably\
    \ annotate news articles with van Dijk\u2019s theory; second, that we can reliably\
    \ predict these labels using machine learning. We show that people have a high\
    \ degree of agreement with each other when annotating the theory (F1 > 0.8, Cohen\u2019\
    s kappa > 0.6), demonstrating that it can be both learned and reliably applied\
    \ by human annotators. Additionally, we demonstrate first steps toward machine\
    \ learning of the theory, achieving a performance of F1 = 0.54, which is 65% of\
    \ human performance. Moreover, we have generated a gold-standard, adjudicated\
    \ corpus of 50 documents for document-level discourse annotation based on the\
    \ ACE Phase 2 corpus."

  abstract: "This study evaluates the performance of four information extraction tools\
    \ (extractors) on identifying health claims in health news headlines. A health\

    \ the foundation for evaluating the accuracy of these claims against authoritative\

  abstract: This paper describes a crowdsourcing experiment on the annotation of plot-like
    structures in English news articles. CrowdThruth methodology and metrics have
    been applied to select valid annotations from the crowd. We further run an in-depth
    analysis of the annotated data by comparing them with available expert data. Our
    results show a valuable use of crowdsourcing annotations for such complex semantic
    tasks, and suggest a new annotation approach which combine crowd and experts.

  abstract: We propose a method to improve human activity recognition in video by
    leveraging semantic information about the target activities from an expert-defined
    linguistic resource, VerbNet. Our hypothesis is that activities that share similar
    event semantics, as defined by the semantic predicates of VerbNet, will be more
    likely to share some visual components. We use a deep convolutional neural network
    approach as a baseline and incorporate linguistic information from VerbNet through
    multi-task learning. We present results of experiments showing the added information
    has negligible impact on recognition performance. We discuss how this may be because
    the lexical semantic information defined by VerbNet is generally not visually
    salient given the video processing approach used here, and how we may handle this
    in future approaches.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present the definition and implementation of the Hunter
    Events Interface (HEI) System. The HEI System is a system for events annotation
    and temporal reasoning in Natural Language Texts and media, mainly oriented to
    texts of historical and cultural contents available on the Web. In this work we
    assume that events are defined through various components: actions, participants,
    locations, and occurrence intervals. The HEI system, through independent services,
    locates (annotates) the various components, and successively associates them to
    a specific event. The objective of this work is to build a system integrating
    services for the identification of events, the discovery of their connections,
    and the evaluation of their consistency. We believe this interface is useful to
    develop applications that use the notion of story, to integrate data of digital
    cultural archives, and to build systems of fruition in the same field. The HEI
    system has been partially developed within the TrasTest project'

  abstract: In this paper, we present the report and findings of the Shared Task on
    Aggression Identification organised as part of the First Workshop on Trolling,
    Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC - 1) at COLING 2018. The task was to develop
    a classifier that could discriminate between Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive,
    and Non-aggressive texts. For this task, the participants were provided with a
    dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments each in Hindi
    (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English for training and validation.
    For testing, two different sets - one from Facebook and another from a different
    social media - were provided. A total of 130 teams registered to participate in
    the task, 30 teams submitted their test runs, and finally 20 teams also sent their
    system description paper which are included in the TRAC workshop proceedings.
    The best system obtained a weighted F-score of 0.64 for both Hindi and English
    on the Facebook test sets, while the best scores on the surprise set were 0.60
    and 0.50 for English and Hindi respectively. The results presented in this report
    depict how challenging the task is. The positive response from the community and
    the great levels of participation in the first edition of this shared task also
    highlights the interest in this topic.

  abstract: This paper describes the process of building a cyberbullying intervention
    interface driven by a machine-learning based text-classification service. We make
    two main contributions. First, we show that cyberbullying can be identified in
    real-time before it takes place, with available machine learning and natural language
    processing tools. Second, we present a mechanism that provides individuals with
    early feedback about how other people would feel about wording choices in their
    messages before they are sent out. This interface not only gives a chance for
    the user to revise the text, but also provides a system-level flagging/intervention
    in a situation related to cyberbullying.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the system submitted for the shared task on
    Aggression Identification in Facebook posts and comments by the team Nishnik.
    Previous works demonstrate that LSTMs have achieved remarkable performance in
    natural language processing tasks. We deploy an LSTM model with an attention unit
    over it. Our system ranks 6th and 4th in the Hindi subtask for Facebook comments
    and subtask for generalized social media data respectively. And it ranks 17th
    and 10th in the corresponding English subtasks.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the work that our team bhanodaig did at Indian Institute
    of Technology (ISM) towards TRAC-1 Shared Task on Aggression Identification in
    Social Media for COLING 2018. In this paper we label aggression identification
    into three categories: Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive and Non-aggressive.
    We train a model to differentiate between these categories and then analyze the
    results in order to better understand how we can distinguish between them. We
    participated in two different tasks named as English (Facebook) task and English
    (Social Media) task. For English (Facebook) task System 05 was our best run (i.e.
    0.3572) above the Random Baseline (i.e. 0.3535). For English (Social Media) task
    our system 02 got the value (i.e. 0.1960) below the Random Bseline (i.e. 0.3477).
    For all of our runs we used Long Short-Term Memory model. Overall, our performance
    is not satisfactory. However, as new entrant to the field, our scores are encouraging
    enough to work for better results in future.'

  abstract: 'The system presented here took part in the 2018 Trolling, Aggression
    and Cyberbullying shared task (Forest and Trees team) and uses a Gated Recurrent
    Neural Network architecture (Cho et al., 2014) in an attempt to assess whether
    combining pre-trained English and Hindi fastText (Mikolov et al., 2018) word embeddings
    as a representation of the sequence input would improve classification performance.
    The motivation for this comes from the fact that the shared task data for English
    contained many Hindi tokens and therefore some users might be doing code-switching:
    the alternation between two or more languages in communication. To test this hypothesis,
    we also aligned Hindi and English vectors using pre-computed SVD matrices that
    pulls representations from different languages into a common space (Smith et al.,
    2017). Two conditions were tested: (i) one with standard pre-trained fastText
    word embeddings where each Hindi word is treated as an OOV token, and (ii) another
    where word embeddings for Hindi and English are loaded in a common vector space,
    so Hindi tokens can be assigned a meaningful representation. We submitted the
    second (i.e., multilingual) system and obtained the scores of 0.531 weighted F1
    for the EN-FB dataset and 0.438 weighted F1 for the EN-TW dataset.'

  abstract: With the advent of the read-write web which facilitates social interactions
    in online spaces, the rise of anti-social behaviour in online spaces has attracted
    the attention of researchers. In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically
    identifying aggression in social media posts. Our team, saroyehun, participated
    in the English track of the Aggression Detection in Social Media Shared Task.
    On this task, we investigate the efficacy of deep neural network models of varying
    complexity. Our results reveal that deep neural network models require more data
    points to do better than an NBSVM linear baseline based on character n-grams.
    Our improved deep neural network models were trained on augmented data and pseudo
    labeled examples. Our LSTM classifier receives a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.6425
    to rank first overall on the Facebook subtask of the shared task. On the social
    media sub-task, our CNN-LSTM model records a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.5920
    to place third overall.

  abstract: "Aggression and related activities like trolling, hate speech etc. involve\
    \ toxic comments in various forms. These are common scenarios in today\u2019s\
    \ time and websites react by shutting down their comment sections. To tackle this,\
    \ an algorithmic solution is preferred to human moderation which is slow and expensive.\
    \ In this paper, we propose a single model capsule network with focal loss to\
    \ achieve this task which is suitable for production environment. Our model achieves\
    \ competitive results over other strong baseline methods, which show its effectiveness\
    \ and that focal loss exhibits significant improvement in such cases where class\
    \ imbalance is a regular issue. Additionally, we show that the problem of extensive\
    \ data preprocessing, data augmentation can be tackled by capsule networks implicitly.\
    \ We achieve an overall ROC AUC of 98.46 on Kaggle-toxic comment dataset and show\
    \ that it beats other architectures by a good margin. As comments tend to be written\
    \ in more than one language, and transliteration is a common problem, we further\
    \ show that our model handles this effectively by applying our model on TRAC shared\
    \ task dataset which contains comments in code-mixed Hindi-English."

  abstract: "Harmful speech has various forms and it has been plaguing the social\
    \ media in different ways. If we need to crackdown different degrees of hate speech\
    \ and abusive behavior amongst it, the classification needs to be based on complex\
    \ ramifications which needs to be defined and hold accountable for, other than\
    \ racist, sexist or against some particular group and community. This paper primarily\
    \ describes how we created an ontological classification of harmful speech based\
    \ on degree of hateful intent and used it to annotate twitter data accordingly.\
    \ The key contribution of this paper is the new dataset of tweets we created based\
    \ on ontological classes and degrees of harmful speech found in the text. We also\
    \ propose supervised classification system for recognizing these respective harmful\
    \ speech classes in the texts hence. This serves as a preliminary work to lay\
    \ down foundation on defining different classes of harmful speech and subsequent\
    \ work will be done in making it\u2019s automatic detection more robust and efficient."

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in the First Shared Task on Aggression
    Identification. The method proposed relies on machine learning to identify social
    media texts which contain aggression. The main features employed by our method
    are information extracted from word embeddings and the output of a sentiment analyser.
    Several machine learning methods and different combinations of features were tried.
    The official submissions used Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. The
    official evaluation showed that for texts similar to the ones in the training
    dataset Random Forests work best, whilst for texts which are different SVMs are
    a better choice. The evaluation also showed that despite its simplicity the method
    performs well when compared with more elaborated methods.

  abstract: With the rise of user-generated content in social media coupled with almost
    non-existent moderation in many such systems, aggressive contents have been observed
    to rise in such forums. In this paper, we work on the problem of aggression detection
    in social media. Aggression can sometimes be expressed directly or overtly or
    it can be hidden or covert in the text. On the other hand, most of the content
    in social media is non-aggressive in nature. We propose an ensemble based system
    to classify an input post to into one of three classes, namely, Overtly Aggressive,
    Covertly Aggressive, and Non-aggressive. Our approach uses three deep learning
    methods, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with five layers (input,
    convolution, pooling, hidden, and output), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM),
    and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM). A majority voting
    based ensemble method is used to combine these classifiers (CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM).
    We trained our method on Facebook comments dataset and tested on Facebook comments
    (in-domain) and other social media posts (cross-domain). Our system achieves the
    F1-score (weighted) of 0.604 for Facebook posts and 0.508 for social media posts.

  abstract: "This paper presents the approach of the team \u201Cgroutar\u201D to the\
    \ shared task on Aggression Identification, considering the test sets in English,\
    \ both from Facebook and general Social Media. This experiment aims to test the\
    \ effect of merging new datasets in the performance of classification models.\
    \ We followed a standard machine learning approach with training, validation,\
    \ and testing phases, and considered features such as part-of-speech, frequencies\
    \ of insults, punctuation, sentiment, and capitalization. In terms of algorithms,\
    \ we experimented with Boosted Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Parallel\
    \ Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. One question appearing was how\
    \ to merge datasets using different classification systems (e.g. aggression vs.\
    \ toxicity). Other issue concerns the possibility to generalize models and apply\
    \ them to data from different social networks. Regarding these, we merged two\
    \ datasets, and the results showed that training with similar data is an advantage\
    \ in the classification of social networks data. However, adding data from different\
    \ platforms, allowed slightly better results in both Facebook and Social Media,\
    \ indicating that more generalized models can be an advantage."

  abstract: The phenomenon of cyberbullying has growing in worrying proportions with
    the development of social networks. Forums and chat rooms are spaces where serious
    damage can now be done to others, while the tools for avoiding on-line spills
    are still limited. This study aims to assess the ability that both classical and
    state-of-the-art vector space modeling methods provide to well known learning
    machines to identify aggression levels in social network cyberbullying (i.e. social
    network posts manually labeled as Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive and
    Non-aggressive). To this end, an exploratory stage was performed first in order
    to find relevant settings to test, i.e. by using training and development samples,
    we trained multiple learning machines using multiple vector space modeling methods
    and discarded the less informative configurations. Finally, we selected the two
    best settings and their voting combination to form three competing systems. These
    systems were submitted to the competition of the TRACK-1 task of the Workshop
    on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying. Our voting combination system resulted
    second place in predicting Aggression levels on a test set of untagged social
    network posts.

  abstract: "Social media platforms allow users to share and discuss their opinions\
    \ online. However, a minority of user posts is aggressive, thereby hinders respectful\
    \ discussion, and \u2014 at an extreme level \u2014 is liable to prosecution.\
    \ The automatic identification of such harmful posts is important, because it\
    \ can support the costly manual moderation of online discussions. Further, the\
    \ automation allows unprecedented analyses of discussion datasets that contain\
    \ millions of posts. This system description paper presents our submission to\
    \ the First Shared Task on Aggression Identification. We propose to augment the\
    \ provided dataset to increase the number of labeled comments from 15,000 to 60,000.\
    \ Thereby, we introduce linguistic variety into the dataset. As a consequence\
    \ of the larger amount of training data, we are able to train a special deep neural\
    \ net, which generalizes especially well to unseen data. To further boost the\
    \ performance, we combine this neural net with three logistic regression classifiers\
    \ trained on character and word n-grams, and hand-picked syntactic features. This\
    \ ensemble is more robust than the individual single models. Our team named \u201C\
    Julian\u201D achieves an F1-score of 60% on both English datasets, 63% on the\
    \ Hindi Facebook dataset, and 38% on the Hindi Twitter dataset."

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning architecture for text
    classification, named cross segment-and-concatenate multi-task learning (CSC-MTL).
    We use CSC-MTL to improve the performance of cyber-aggression detection from text.
    Our approach provides a robust shared feature representation for multi-task learning
    by detecting contrasts and similarities among polarity and neutral classes. We
    participated in the cyber-aggression shared task under the team name uOttawa.
    We report 59.74% F1 performance for the Facebook test set and 56.9% for the Twitter
    test set, for detecting aggression from text.

  abstract: Comment sections of online news providers have enabled millions to share
    and discuss their opinions on news topics. Today, moderators ensure respectful
    and informative discussions by deleting not only insults, defamation, and hate
    speech, but also unverifiable facts. This process has to be transparent and comprehensive
    in order to keep the community engaged. Further, news providers have to make sure
    to not give the impression of censorship or dissemination of fake news. Yet manual
    moderation is very expensive and becomes more and more unfeasible with the increasing
    amount of comments. Hence, we propose a semi-automatic, holistic approach, which
    includes comment features but also their context, such as information about users
    and articles. For evaluation, we present experiments on a novel corpus of 3 million
    news comments annotated by a team of professional moderators.

  abstract: "Cyberbullying and cyberaggression are serious and widespread issues increasingly\
    \ affecting Internet users. With the widespread of social media networks, bullying,\
    \ once limited to particular places, can now occur anytime and anywhere. Cyberaggression\
    \ refers to aggressive online behaviour that aims at harming other individuals,\
    \ and involves rude, insulting, offensive, teasing or demoralising comments through\
    \ online social media. Considering the dangerous consequences that cyberaggression\
    \ has on its victims and its rapid spread amongst internet users (specially kids\
    \ and teens), it is crucial to understand how cyberbullying occurs to prevent\
    \ it from escalating. Given the massive information overload on the Web, there\
    \ is an imperious need to develop intelligent techniques to automatically detect\
    \ harmful content, which would allow the large-scale social media monitoring and\
    \ early detection of undesired situations. This paper presents the Isistanitos\u2019\
    s approach for detecting aggressive content in multiple social media sites. The\
    \ approach is based on combining Support Vector Machines and Recurrent Neural\
    \ Network models for analysing a wide-range of character, word, word embeddings,\
    \ sentiment and irony features. Results confirmed the difficulty of the task (particularly\
    \ for detecting covert aggressions), showing the limitations of traditionally\
    \ used features."

  abstract: We describe the participation of team TakeLab in the aggression detection
    shared task at the TRAC1 workshop for English. Aggression manifests in a variety
    of ways. Unlike some forms of aggression that are impossible to prevent in day-to-day
    life, aggressive speech abounding on social networks could in principle be prevented
    or at least reduced by simply disabling users that post aggressively worded messages.
    The first step in achieving this is to detect such messages. The task, however,
    is far from being trivial, as what is considered as aggressive speech can be quite
    subjective, and the task is further complicated by the noisy nature of user-generated
    text on social networks. Our system learns to distinguish between open aggression,
    covert aggression, and non-aggression in social media texts. We tried different
    machine learning approaches, including traditional (shallow) machine learning
    models, deep learning models, and a combination of both. We achieved respectable
    results, ranking 4th and 8th out of 31 submissions on the Facebook and Twitter
    test sets, respectively.

  abstract: "This paper describes the participation of team DA-LD-Hildesheim from\
    \ the Information Retrieval Lab(IRLAB) at DA-IICT Gandhinagar, India in collaboration\
    \ with the University of Hildesheim, Germany and LDRP-ITR, Gandhinagar, India\
    \ in a shared task on Aggression Identification workshop in COLING 2018. The objective\
    \ of the shared task is to identify the level of aggression from the User-Generated\
    \ contents within Social media written in English, Devnagiri Hindi and Romanized\
    \ Hindi. Aggression levels are categorized into three predefined classes namely:\
    \ \u2018Overtly Aggressive\u2018, \u2018Covertly Aggressive\u2018 and \u2018Non-aggressive\u2018\
    . The participating teams are required to develop a multi-class classifier which\
    \ classifies User-generated content into these pre-defined classes. Instead of\
    \ relying on a bag-of-words model, we have used pre-trained vectors for word embedding.\
    \ We have performed experiments with standard machine learning classifiers. In\
    \ addition, we have developed various deep learning models for the multi-class\
    \ classification problem. Using the validation data, we found that validation\
    \ accuracy of our deep learning models outperform all standard machine learning\
    \ classifiers and voting based ensemble techniques and results on test data support\
    \ these findings. We have also found that hyper-parameters of the deep neural\
    \ network are the keys to improve the results."

  abstract: We propose to study the evolution of concepts by learning to complete
    diachronic analogies between lists of terms which relate to the same concept at
    different points in time. We present a number of models based on operations on
    word embedddings that correspond to different assumptions about the characteristics
    of diachronic analogies and change in concept vocabularies. These are tested in
    a quantitative evaluation for nine different concepts on a corpus of Dutch newspapers
    from the 1950s and 1980s. We show that a model which treats the concept terms
    as analogous and learns weights to compensate for diachronic changes (weighted
    linear combination) is able to more accurately predict the missing term than a
    learned transformation and two baselines for most of the evaluated concepts. We
    also find that all models tend to be coherent in relation to the represented concept,
    but less discriminative in regard to other concepts. Additionally, we evaluate
    the effect of aligning the time-specific embedding spaces using orthogonal Procrustes,
    finding varying effects on performance, depending on the model, concept and evaluation
    metric. For the weighted linear combination, however, results improve with alignment
    in a majority of cases. All related code is released publicly.

  abstract: We present a data-driven approach to detect periods of linguistic change
    and the lexical and grammatical features contributing to change. We focus on the
    development of scientific English in the late modern period. Our approach is based
    on relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) comparing temporally adjacent
    periods and sliding over the time line from past to present. Using a diachronic
    corpus of scientific publications of the Royal Society of London, we show how
    periods of change reflect the interplay between lexis and grammar, where periods
    of lexical expansion are typically followed by periods of grammatical consolidation
    resulting in a balance between expressivity and communicative efficiency. Our
    method is generic and can be applied to other data sets, languages and time ranges.

    s are said to be a prominent characteristic of \u201Clow brow\u201D literature,\
    \ and conversely, a negative marker of \u201Chigh brow\u201D literature. Clich\xE9\
    s may concern the storyline, the characters, or the style of writing. We focus\

    \ The results show to what extent the negative view on clich\xE9s is supported\
    \ by data: we find a significant negative correlation of -0.48 between clich\xE9\

  abstract: 'We show how to classify the phrasing of readout poems with the help of
    machine learning algorithms that use manually engineered features or automatically
    learn representations. We investigate modern and postmodern poems from the webpage
    lyrikline, and focus on two exemplary rhythmical patterns in order to detect the
    rhythmic phrasing: The Parlando and the Variable Foot. These rhythmical patterns
    have been compared by using two important theoretical works: The Generative Theory
    of Tonal Music and the Rhythmic Phrasing in English Verse. Using both, we focus
    on a combination of four different features: The grouping structure, the metrical
    structure, the time-span-variation, and the prolongation in order to detect the
    rhythmic phrasing in the two rhythmical types. We use manually engineered features
    based on text-speech alignment and parsing for classification. We also train a
    neural network to learn its own representation based on text, speech and audio
    during pauses. The neural network outperforms manual feature engineering, reaching
    an f-measure of 0.85.'

  abstract: Word choice is dependent on the cultural context of writers and their
    subjects. Different words are used to describe similar actions, objects, and features
    based on factors such as class, race, gender, geography and political affinity.
    Exploratory techniques based on locating and counting words may, therefore, lead
    to conclusions that reinforce culturally inflected boundaries. We offer a new
    method, the DualNeighbors algorithm, for linking thematically similar documents
    both within and across discursive and linguistic barriers to reveal cross-cultural
    connections. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this technique are shown
    as applied to two cultural datasets of interest to researchers across the humanities
    and social sciences. An open-source implementation of the DualNeighbors algorithm
    is provided to assist in its application.

  abstract: Measuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now
    often a building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change. But do
    measures of textual similarity and distance really correspond to evidence about
    cultural proximity and differentiation? To explore that question empirically,
    this paper compares textual and social measures of the similarities between genres
    of English-language fiction. Existing measures of textual similarity (cosine similarity
    on tf-idf vectors or topic vectors) are also compared to new strategies that strive
    to anchor textual measurement in a social context.

  abstract: "In this paper, we tackle four different tasks of non-literal language\
    \ classification: token and construction level metaphor detection, classification\
    \ of idiomatic use of infinitive-verb compounds, and classification of non-literal\
    \ particle verbs. One of the tasks operates on the token level, while the three\
    \ other tasks classify constructions such as \u201Chot topic\u201D or \u201Cstehen\
    \ lassen\u201D (\u201Cto allow sth. to stand\u201D vs. \u201Cto abandon so.\u201D\
    ). The two metaphor detection tasks are in English, while the two non-literal\
    \ language detection tasks are in German. We propose a simple context-encoding\
    \ LSTM model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on two tasks. Additionally,\
    \ we experiment with different embeddings for the token level metaphor detection\
    \ task and find that 1) their performance varies according to the genre, and 2)\
    \ word2vec embeddings perform best on 3 out of 4 genres, despite being one of\
    \ the simplest tested model. In summary, we present a large-scale analysis of\
    \ a neural model for non-literal language classification (i) at different granularities,\
    \ (ii) in different languages, (iii) over different non-literal language phenomena."

  abstract: We present the first supervised approach to rhyme detection with Siamese
    Recurrent Networks (SRN) that offer near perfect performance (97% accuracy) with
    a single model on rhyme pairs for German, English and French, allowing future
    large scale analyses. SRNs learn a similarity metric on variable length character
    sequences that can be used as judgement on the distance of imperfect rhyme pairs
    and for binary classification. For training, we construct a diachronically balanced
    rhyme goldstandard of New High German (NHG) poetry. For further testing, we sample
    a second collection of NHG poetry and set of contemporary Hip-Hop lyrics, annotated
    for rhyme and assonance. We train several high-performing SRN models and evaluate
    them qualitatively on selected sonnetts.

    from the 15th to the 19th century. The methods include machine translation (neural
    and statistical), edit distance and rule-based FST. Different normalization methods
    are compared and evaluated. All of the methods have their own strengths in word
    normalization. This calls for finding ways of combining the results from these
    methods to leverage their individual strengths.

  abstract: Can language analysis reveal the underlying social power relations that
    exist between participants of an interaction? Prior work within NLP has shown
    promise in this area, but the performance of automatically predicting power relations
    using NLP analysis of social interactions remains wanting. In this paper, we present
    a novel neural architecture that captures manifestations of power within individual
    emails which are then aggregated in an order-preserving way in order to infer
    the direction of power between pairs of participants in an email thread. We obtain
    an accuracy of 80.4%, a 10.1% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, in this
    task. We further apply our model to the task of predicting power relations between
    individuals based on the entire set of messages exchanged between them; here also,
    our model significantly outperforms the 70.0% accuracy using prior state-of-the-art
    techniques, obtaining an accuracy of 83.0%.

  abstract: "The detection of reused text is important in a wide range of disciplines.\
    \ However, even as research in the field of plagiarism detection is constantly\
    \ improving, heavily modified or paraphrased text is still challenging for current\
    \ methodologies. For historical texts, these problems are even more severe, since\
    \ text sources were often subject to stronger and more frequent modifications.\
    \ Despite the need for tools to automate text criticism, e.g., tracing modifications\
    \ in historical text, algorithmic support is still limited. While current techniques\
    \ can tell if and how frequently a text has been modified, very little work has\
    \ been done on determining the degree and kind of paraphrastic modification\u2014\
    despite such information being of substantial interest to scholars. We present\
    \ a human-interpretable, feature-based method to measure paraphrastic modification.\
    \ Evaluating our technique on three data sets, we find that our approach performs\
    \ competitive to text similarity scores borrowed from machine translation evaluation,\
    \ being much harder to interpret."

  abstract: "The presence of misspellings and other errors or non-standard word forms\
    \ poses a considerable challenge for NLP systems. Although several supervised\
    \ approaches have been proposed previously to normalize these, annotated training\
    \ data is scarce for many languages. We investigate, therefore, an unsupervised\
    \ method where correction candidates for Swedish language learners\u2019 errors\
    \ are retrieved from word embeddings. Furthermore, we compare the usefulness of\
    \ combining cosine similarity with orthographic and phonological similarity based\
    \ on a neural grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system we train for this purpose.\
    \ Although combinations of similarity measures have been explored for finding\
    \ error correction candidates, it remains unclear how these measures relate to\
    \ each other and how much they contribute individually to identifying the correct\
    \ alternative. We experiment with different combinations of these and find that\
    \ integrating phonological information is especially useful when the majority\
    \ of learner errors are related to misspellings, but less so when errors are of\
    \ a variety of types including, e.g. grammatical errors."

  abstract: Coreference resolution is the task of grouping together references to
    the same discourse entity. Resolving coreference in literary texts could benefit
    a number of Digital Humanities (DH) tasks, such as analyzing the depiction of
    characters and/or their relations. Domain-dependent training data has shown to
    improve coreference resolution for many domains, e.g. the biomedical domain, as
    its properties differ significantly from news text or dialogue, on which automatic
    systems are typically trained. Literary texts could also benefit from corpora
    annotated with coreference. We therefore analyze the specific properties of coreference-related
    phenomena on a number of texts and give directions for the adaptation of annotation
    guidelines. As some of the adaptations have profound impact, we also present a
    new annotation tool for coreference, with a focus on enabling annotation of long
    texts with many discourse entities.

    \ of members, and that were not known (compiled in a list) beforehand. The approach\

  abstract: This paper focuses on linguistic complexity from a relative perspective.
    It presents a grounded language learning system that can be used to study linguistic
    complexity from a developmental point of view and introduces a tool for generating
    a gold standard in order to evaluate the performance of the learning system. In
    general, researchers agree that it is more feasible to approach complexity from
    an objective or theory-oriented viewpoint than from a subjective or user-related
    point of view. Studies that have adopted a relative complexity approach have showed
    some preferences for L2 learners. In this paper, we try to show that computational
    models of the process of language acquisition may be an important tool to consider
    children and the process of first language acquisition as suitable candidates
    for evaluating the complexity of languages.

  abstract: 'Distributional Semantic Models have been successfully used for modeling
    selectional preferences in a variety of scenarios, since distributional similarity
    naturally provides an estimate of the degree to which an argument satisfies the
    requirement of a given predicate. However, we argue that the performance of such
    models on rare verb-argument combinations has received relatively little attention:
    it is not clear whether they are able to distinguish the combinations that are
    simply atypical, or implausible, from the semantically anomalous ones, and in
    particular, they have never been tested on the task of modeling their differences
    in processing complexity. In this paper, we compare two different models of thematic
    fit by testing their ability of identifying violations of selectional restrictions
    in two datasets from the experimental studies.'

  abstract: We use two small parallel corpora for comparing the morphological complexity
    of Spanish, Otomi and Nahuatl. These are languages that belong to different linguistic
    families, the latter are low-resourced. We take into account two quantitative
    criteria, on one hand the distribution of types over tokens in a corpus, on the
    other, perplexity and entropy as indicators of word structure predictability.
    We show that a language can be complex in terms of how many different morphological
    word forms can produce, however, it may be less complex in terms of predictability
    of its internal structure of words.

  abstract: According to the UNIFORM INFORMATION DENSITY (UID) hypothesis (Levy and
    Jaeger, 2007; Jaeger, 2010), speakers tend to distribute information density across
    the signal uniformly while producing language. The prior works cited above studied
    syntactic reduction in language production at particular choice points in a sentence.
    In contrast, we use a variant of the above UID hypothesis in order to investigate
    the extent to which word order choices in Hindi are influenced by the drive to
    minimize the variance of information across entire sentences. To this end, we
    propose multiple lexical and syntactic measures (at both word and constituent
    levels) to capture the uniform spread of information across a sentence. Subsequently,
    we incorporate these measures in machine learning models aimed to distinguish
    between a naturally occurring corpus sentence and its grammatical variants (expressing
    the same idea). Our results indicate that our UID measures are not a significant
    factor in predicting the corpus sentence in the presence of lexical surprisal,
    a competing control predictor. Finally, in the light of other recent works, we
    conclude with a discussion of reasons for UID not being suitable for a theory
    of word order.

  abstract: 'We present the results of our investigations aiming at identifying the
    most informative linguistic complexity features for classifying language learning
    levels in three different datasets. The datasets vary across two dimensions: the
    size of the instances (texts vs. sentences) and the language learning skill they
    involve (reading comprehension texts vs. texts written by learners themselves).
    We present a subset of the most predictive features for each dataset, taking into
    consideration significant differences in their per-class mean values and show
    that these subsets lead not only to simpler models, but also to an improved classification
    performance. Furthermore, we pinpoint fourteen central features that are good
    predictors regardless of the size of the linguistic unit analyzed or the skills
    involved, which include both morpho-syntactic and lexical dimensions.'

  abstract: This paper presents an approach to evaluate complexity of a given natural
    language input by means of a Fuzzy Grammar with some fuzzy logic formulations.
    Usually, the approaches in linguistics has described a natural language grammar
    by means of discrete terms. However, a grammar can be explained in terms of degrees
    by following the concepts of linguistic gradience & fuzziness. Understanding a
    grammar as a fuzzy or gradient object allows us to establish degrees of grammaticality
    for every linguistic input. This shall be meaningful for linguistic complexity
    considering that the less grammatical an input is the more complex its processing
    will be. In this regard, the degree of complexity of a linguistic input (which
    is a linguistic representation of a natural language expression) depends on the
    chosen grammar. The bases of the fuzzy grammar are shown here. Some of these are
    described by Fuzzy Type Theory. The linguistic inputs are characterized by constraints
    through a Property Grammar.

  abstract: Given advances in computational linguistic analysis of complex languages
    using Machine Learning as well as standard Finite State Transducers, coupled with
    recent efforts in language revitalization, the time was right to organize a first
    workshop to bring together experts in language technology and linguists on the
    one hand with language practitioners and revitalization experts on the other.
    This one-day meeting provides a promising forum to discuss new research on polysynthetic
    languages in combination with the needs of linguistic communities where such languages
    are written and spoken.

  abstract: We experiment with training an encoder-decoder neural model for mimicking
    the behavior of an existing hand-written finite-state morphological grammar for
    Arapaho verbs, a polysynthetic language with a highly complex verbal inflection
    system. After adjusting for ambiguous parses, we find that the system is able
    to generalize to unseen forms with accuracies of 98.68% (unambiguous verbs) and
    92.90% (all verbs).

  abstract: In this article we describe the application of finite-state transducers
    to the morphological and phonological systems of Chukchi, a polysynthetic language
    spoken in the north of the Russian Federation. The language exhibits progressive
    and regressive vowel harmony, productive incorporation and extensive circumfixing.
    To implement the analyser we use the well-known Helsinki Finite-State Toolkit
    (HFST). The resulting model covers the majority of the morphological and phonological
    processes. A brief evaluation carried out on publically-available corpora shows
    that the coverage of the transducer is between and 53% and 76%. An error evaluation
    of 100 tokens randomly selected from the corpus, which were not covered by the
    analyser shows that most of the morphological processes are covered and that the
    majority of errors are caused by a limited stem lexicon.

  abstract: "Kanyen\u2019k\xE9ha (in English, Mohawk) is an Iroquoian language spoken\
    \ primarily in Eastern Canada (Ontario, Qu\xE9bec). Classified as endangered,\
    \ it has only a small number of speakers and very few younger native speakers.\
    \ Consequently, teachers and courses, teaching materials and software are urgently\
    \ needed. In the case of software, the polysynthetic nature of Kanyen\u2019k\xE9\
    ha means that the number of possible combinations grows exponentially and soon\
    \ surpasses attempts to capture variant forms by hand. It is in this context that\
    \ we describe an attempt to produce language teaching materials based on a generative\
    \ approach. A natural language generation environment (ivi/Vinci) embedded in\
    \ a web environment (VinciLingua) makes it possible to produce, by rule, variant\
    \ forms of indefinite complexity. These may be used as models to explore, or as\
    \ materials to which learners respond. Generated materials may take the form of\
    \ written text, oral utterances, or images; responses may be typed on a keyboard,\
    \ gestural (using a mouse) or, to a limited extent, oral. The software also provides\
    \ complex orthographic, morphological and syntactic analysis of learner productions.\
    \ We describe the trajectory of development of materials for a suite of four courses\
    \ on Kanyen\u2019k\xE9ha, the first of which will be taught in the fall of 2018."

    \ of a collaboration between Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa Kanyen\u2019k\xE9ha immersion\
    \ school and the Canadian National Research Council\u2019s Indigenous Language\
    \ Technology lab. The purpose of Kawenn\xF3n:nis is to build on the educational\

    \ students in learning how to conjugate verbs in Kanyen\u2019k\xE9ha; a skill\
    \ that is essential to mastering the language. Kawenn\xF3n:nis is implemented\
    \ with both web and mobile front-ends that communicate with an application programming\
    \ interface that in turn communicates with a symbolic language model implemented\
    \ as a finite state transducer. Eventually, it will serve as a foundation for\

  abstract: Inuktitut is a polysynthetic language spoken in Northern Canada and is
    one of the official languages of the Canadian territory of Nunavut. As such, the
    Nunavut Legislature publishes all of its proceedings in parallel English and Inuktitut.
    Several parallel English-Inuktitut corpora from these proceedings have been created
    from these data and are publically available. The corpus used for current experiments
    is described. Morphological processing of one of these corpora was carried out
    and details about the processing are provided. Then, the processed corpus was
    used in morphological analysis and machine translation (MT) experiments. The morphological
    analysis experiments aimed to improve the coverage of morphological processing
    of the corpus, and compare an additional experimental condition to previously
    published results. The machine translation experiments made use of the additional
    morphologically analyzed word types in a statistical machine translation system
    designed to translate to and from Inuktitut morphemes. Results are reported and
    next steps are defined.

  abstract: Machine translation from polysynthetic to fusional languages is a challenging
    task, which gets further complicated by the limited amount of parallel text available.
    Thus, translation performance is far from the state of the art for high-resource
    and more intensively studied language pairs. To shed light on the phenomena which
    hamper automatic translation to and from polysynthetic languages, we study translations
    from three low-resource, polysynthetic languages (Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem
    Nokki) into Spanish and vice versa. Doing so, we find that in a morpheme-to-morpheme
    alignment an important amount of information contained in polysynthetic morphemes
    has no Spanish counterpart, and its translation is often omitted. We further conduct
    a qualitative analysis and, thus, identify morpheme types that are commonly hard
    to align or ignored in the translation process.

  abstract: Morphological analysis of morphologically rich and low-resource languages
    is important to both descriptive linguistics and natural language processing.
    Field documentary efforts usually procure analyzed data in cooperation with native
    speakers who are capable of providing some level of linguistic information. Manually
    annotating such data is very expensive and the traditional process is arguably
    too slow in the face of language endangerment and loss. We report on a case study
    of learning to automatically gloss a Nakh-Daghestanian language, Lezgi, from a
    very small amount of seed data. We compare a conditional random field based sequence
    labeler and a neural encoder-decoder model and show that a nearly 0.9 F1-score
    on labeled accuracy of morphemes can be achieved with 3,000 words of transcribed
    oral text. Errors are mostly limited to morphemes with high allomorphy. These
    results are potentially useful for developing rapid annotation and fieldwork tools
    to support documentation of morphologically rich, endangered languages.

  abstract: "In this talk I will describe the interaction of linguistics and language\
    \ technologies in Surface Construction Labeling (SCL) from the perspective of\
    \ corpus annotation tasks such as definiteness, modality, and causality. Linguistically,\
    \ following Construction Grammar, SCL recognizes that meaning may be carried by\
    \ morphemes, words, or arbitrary constellations of morpho-lexical elements. SCL\
    \ is like Shallow Semantic Parsing in that it does not attempt a full compositional\
    \ analysis of meaning, but rather identifies only the main elements of a semantic\
    \ frame, where the frames may be invoked by constructions as well as lexical items.\
    \ Computationally, SCL is different from tasks such as information extraction\
    \ in that it deals only with meanings that are expressed in a conventional, grammaticalized\
    \ way and does not address inferred meanings. I review the work of Dunietz (2018)\
    \ on the labeling of causal frames including causal connectives and cause and\
    \ effect arguments. I will describe how to design an annotation scheme for SCL,\
    \ including isolating basic units of form and meaning and building a \u201Cconstructicon\u201D\
    . I will conclude with remarks about the nature of universal categories and universal\
    \ meaning representations in language technologies. This talk describes joint\
    \ work with Jaime Carbonell, Jesse Dunietz, Nathan Schneider, and Miriam Petruck."

  abstract: "I will describe an unorthodox approach to lexical semantic annotation\

    \ as it is robust, cost-effective, easily understood, not too language-specific,\

  abstract: Multiword expressions have posed a challenge in the past for computational
    linguistics since they comprise a heterogeneous family of word clusters and are
    difficult to detect in natural language data. In this paper, we present a fMRI
    study based on language comprehension to provide neuroimaging evidence for processing
    MWEs. We investigate whether different MWEs have distinct neural bases, e.g. if
    verbal MWEs involve separate brain areas from non-verbal MWEs and if MWEs with
    varying levels of cohesiveness activate dissociable brain regions. Our study contributes
    neuroimaging evidence illustrating that different MWEs elicit spatially distinct
    patterns of activation. We also adapt an association measure, usually used to
    detect MWEs, as a cognitively plausible metric for language processing.

  abstract: We conduct a corpus study to investigate the structure of multi-word expressions
    (MWEs) in the clinical domain. Based on an existing medical taxonomy, we develop
    an annotation scheme and label a sample of MWEs from a Dutch corpus with semantic
    and grammatical features. The analysis of the annotated data shows that the formal
    structure of clinical MWEs correlates with their conceptual properties. The insights
    gained from this study could inform the design of Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) systems for clinical writing, but also for other specialized genres.

  abstract: This paper presents the results of two experiments carried out within
    the framework of computational construction grammar. Starting from the constructionist
    point of view that there are just constructions in language, including lexical
    ones, we tested the validity of a clustering algorithm that was primarily designed
    for MWE extraction, the cpr-score (Colson, 2017), on Chinese word segmentation.
    Our results indicate a striking recall rate of 75 percent without any special
    adaptation to Chinese or to the lexicon, which confirms that there is some similarity
    between extracting MWEs and CWS. Our second experiment also suggests that the
    same methodology might be used for extracting more schematic or abstract constructions,
    thereby providing evidence for the statistical foundation of construction grammar.

  abstract: We shed light on aspects of the relation between the semantics and the
    syntactic flexibility of multiword expressions by investigating fixed adjective
    similes (FS), a predicative multiword expression class not studied in this respect
    before. We find that only a subset of the syntactic structures observed in the
    data are related with idiomaticity. We identify and measure two aspects of idiomaticity,
    one of which seems to allow for predictions about FS syntactic flexibility. Our
    research draws on a resource developed with the semantic and detailed syntactic
    annotation of web-retrieved Modern Greek material, indicating frequency of use
    of the individual similes.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore the challenges of building a computational lexicon
    for Moroccan Darija (MD), an Arabic dialect spoken by over 32 million people worldwide
    but which only recently has begun appearing frequently in written form in social
    media. We raise the question of what belongs in such a lexicon and start by describing
    our work building traditional word-level lexicon entries with their English translations.
    We then discuss challenges in translating idiomatic MD text that led to creating
    multi-word expression lexicon entries whose meanings could not be fully derived
    from the individual words. Finally, we provide a preliminary exploration of constructions
    to be considered for inclusion in an MD constructicon by translating examples
    of English constructions and examining their MD counterparts.

  abstract: This paper presents a Basque corpus where Verbal Multiword Expressions
    (VMWEs) were annotated following universal guidelines. Information on the annotation
    is given, and some ideas for discussion upon the guidelines are also proposed.
    The corpus is useful not only for NLP-related research, but also to draw conclusions
    on Basque phraseology in comparison with other languages.

  abstract: Although English grammar encodes a number of semantic contrasts with tense
    and aspect marking, these semantics are currently ignored by Abstract Meaning
    Representation (AMR) annotations. This paper extends sentence-level AMR to include
    a coarse-grained treatment of tense and aspect semantics. The proposed framework
    augments the representation of finite predications to include a four-way temporal
    distinction (event time before, up to, at, or after speech time) and several aspectual
    distinctions (including static vs. dynamic, habitual vs. episodic, and telic vs.
    atelic). This will enable AMR to be used for NLP tasks and applications that require
    sophisticated reasoning about time and event structure.

  abstract: Unlike corpora of written language where segmentation can mainly be derived
    from orthographic punctuation marks, the basis for segmenting spoken language
    corpora is not predetermined by the primary data, but rather has to be established
    by the corpus compilers. This impedes consistent querying and visualization of
    such data. Several ways of segmenting have been proposed, some of which are based
    on syntax. In this study, we developed and evaluated annotation and segmentation
    guidelines in reference to the topological field model for German. We can show
    that these guidelines are used consistently across annotators. We also investigated
    the influence of various interactional settings with a rather simple measure,
    the word-count per segment and unit-type. We observed that the word count and
    the distribution of each unit type differ in varying interactional settings and
    that our developed segmentation and annotation guidelines are used consistently
    across annotators. In conclusion, our syntax-based segmentations reflect interactional
    properties that are intrinsic to the social interactions that participants are
    involved in. This can be used for further analysis of social interaction and opens
    the possibility for automatic segmentation of transcripts.

  abstract: "Corpora with language learner writing usually consist of essays, which\
    \ are difficult to annotate reliably and to process automatically due to the high\
    \ degree of freedom and the nature of learner language. We develop a task which\
    \ mildly constrains learner utterances to facilitate consistent annotation and\
    \ reliable automatic processing but at the same time does not prime learners with\
    \ textual information. In this task, learners retell a comic strip. We present\
    \ the resulting task-based corpus of stories written by learners of German. We\
    \ designed the corpus to be able to serve multiple purposes: The corpus was manually\
    \ annotated, including target hypotheses and syntactic structures. We achieve\
    \ a very high inter-annotator agreement: \u03BA = 0.765 for the annotation of\
    \ minimal target hypotheses and \u03BA = 0.507 for the extended target hypotheses.\
    \ We attribute this to the design of our task and the annotation guidelines, which\
    \ are based on those for the Falko corpus (Reznicek et al., 2012)."

  abstract: "When a hazard such as a hurricane threatens, people are forced to make\
    \ a wide variety of decisions, and the information they receive and produce can\
    \ influence their own and others\u2019 actions. As social media grows more popular,\
    \ an increasing number of people are using social media platforms to obtain and\
    \ share information about approaching threats and discuss their interpretations\
    \ of the threat and their protective decisions. This work aims to improve understanding\
    \ of natural disasters through social media and provide an annotation scheme to\
    \ identify themes in user\u2019s social media behavior and facilitate efforts\
    \ in supervised machine learning. To that end, this work has three contributions:\
    \ (1) the creation of an annotation scheme to consistently identify hazard-related\
    \ themes in Twitter, (2) an overview of agreement rates and difficulties in identifying\
    \ annotation categories, and (3) a public release of both the dataset and guidelines\
    \ developed from this scheme."

  abstract: "This paper presents a treebank for the healthcare domain developed at\
    \ ezDI. The treebank is created from a wide array of clinical health record documents\
    \ across hospitals. The data has been de-identified and annotated for constituent\
    \ syntactic structure. The treebank contains a total of 52053 sentences that have\
    \ been sampled for subdomains as well as linguistic variations. The paper outlines\
    \ the sampling process followed to ensure a better domain representation in the\
    \ corpus, the annotation process and challenges, and corpus statistics. The Penn\
    \ Treebank tagset and guidelines were largely followed, but there were many syntactic\
    \ contexts that warranted adaptation of the guidelines. The treebank created was\
    \ used to re-train the Berkeley parser and the Stanford parser. These parsers\
    \ were also trained with the GENIA treebank for comparative quality assessment.\
    \ Our treebank yielded great-er accuracy on both parsers. Berkeley parser performed\

  abstract: We describe and evaluate different approaches to the conversion of gold
    standard corpus data from Stanford Typed Dependencies (SD) and Penn-style constituent
    trees to the latest English Universal Dependencies representation (UD 2.2). Our
    results indicate that pure SD to UD conversion is highly accurate across multiple
    genres, resulting in around 1.5% errors, but can be improved further to fewer
    than 0.5% errors given access to annotations beyond the pure syntax tree, such
    as entity types and coreference resolution, which are necessary for correct generation
    of several UD relations. We show that constituent-based conversion using CoreNLP
    (with automatic NER) performs substantially worse in all genres, including when
    using gold constituent trees, primarily due to underspecification of phrasal grammatical
    functions.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose the first model for multiword expression (MWE)
    compositionality prediction based on character-level neural network language models.
    Experimental results on two kinds of MWEs (noun compounds and verb-particle constructions)
    and two languages (English and German) suggest that character-level neural network
    language models capture knowledge of multiword expression compositionality, in
    particular for English noun compounds and the particle component of English verb-particle
    constructions. In contrast to many other approaches to MWE compositionality prediction,
    this character-level approach does not require token-level identification of MWEs
    in a training corpus, and can potentially predict the compositionality of out-of-vocabulary
    MWEs.

  abstract: This paper describes the construction and annotation of a corpus of verbal
    MWEs for English, as part of the PARSEME Shared Task 1.1 on automatic identification
    of verbal MWEs. The criteria for corpus selection, the categories of MWEs used,
    and the training process are discussed, along with the particular issues that
    led to revisions in edition 1.1 of the annotation guidelines. Finally, an overview
    of the characteristics of the final annotated corpus is presented, as well as
    some discussion on inter-annotator agreement.

  abstract: We present tools for lexicon and corpus management that offer cooperating
    functionality in corpus annotation. The former, named Cradle, stores a set of
    words and expressions where multi-word expressions are defined with their own
    part-of-speech information and internal syntactic structures. The latter, named
    ChaKi, manages text corpora with part-of-speech (POS) and syntactic dependency
    structure annotations. Those two tools cooperate so that the words and multi-word
    expressions stored in Cradle are directly referred to by ChaKi in conducting corpus
    annotation, and the words and expressions annotated in ChaKi can be output as
    a list of lexical entities that are to be stored in Cradle.

  abstract: Automatic syntactic parsing for question constructions is a challenging
    task due to the paucity of training examples in most treebanks. The near absence
    of question constructions is due to the dominance of the news domain in treebanking
    efforts. In this paper, we compare two synthetic low-cost question treebank creation
    methods with a conventional manual high-cost annotation method in the context
    of three domains (news questions, political talk shows, and chatbots) for Modern
    Standard Arabic, a language with relatively low resources and rich morphology.
    Our results show that synthetic methods can be effective at significantly reducing
    parsing errors for a target domain without having to invest large resources on
    manual annotation; and the combination of manual and synthetic methods is our
    best domain-independent performer.

  abstract: This paper describes two systems for detecting Verbal Multiword Expressions
    (VMWEs) which both competed in the closed track at the PARSEME VMWE Shared Task
    2018. CRF-DepTree-categs implements an approach based on the dependency tree,
    intended to exploit the syntactic and semantic relations between tokens; CRF-Seq-nocategs
    implements a robust sequential method which requires only lemmas and morphosyntactic
    tags. Both systems ranked in the top half of the ranking, the latter ranking second
    for token-based evaluation. The code for both systems is published under the GNU
    General Public License version 3.0 and is available at http://github.com/erwanm/adapt-vmwe18.

  abstract: This paper describes the Deep-BGT system that participated to the PARSEME
    shared task 2018 on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs).
    Our system is language-independent and uses the bidirectional Long Short-Term
    Memory model with a Conditional Random Field layer on top (bidirectional LSTM-CRF).
    To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one that employs the bidirectional
    LSTM-CRF model for VMWE identification. Furthermore, the gappy 1-level tagging
    scheme is used for discontiguity and overlaps. Our system was evaluated on 10
    languages in the open track and it was ranked the second in terms of the general
    ranking metric.

  abstract: This paper addresses the issue of multi-word expression (MWE) detection
    by employing a new decoding strategy inspired after graph-based parsing. We show
    that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art results with minimum feature-engineering,
    just by relying on lexicalized and morphological attributes. We validate our approach
    in a multilingual setting, using standard MWE corpora supplied in the PARSEME
    Shared Task.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe Mumpitz, the system we submitted to the PARSEME
    Shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs).
    Mumpitz consists of a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) with Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and a heuristic that leverages the dependency information
    provided in the PARSEME corpus data to differentiate VMWEs in a sentence. We submitted
    results for seven languages in the closed track of the task and for one language
    in the open track. For the open track we used the same system, but with pretrained
    instead of randomly initialized word embeddings to improve the system performance.

  abstract: "We describe the TRAPACC system and its variant TRAPACCS that participated\
    \ in the closed track of the PARSEME Shared Task 2018 on labeling verbal multiword\
    \ expressions (VMWEs). TRAPACC is a modified arc-standard transition system based\
    \ on Constant and Nivre\u2019s (2016) model of joint syntactic and lexical analysis\
    \ in which the oracle is approximated using a classifier. For TRAPACC, the classifier\
    \ consists of a data-independent dimension reduction and a convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN) for learning and labelling transitions. TRAPACCS extends TRAPACC\
    \ by replacing the softmax layer of the CNN with a support vector machine (SVM).\
    \ We report the results obtained for 19 languages, for 8 of which our system yields\
    \ the best results compared to other participating systems in the closed-track\
    \ of the shared task."

    the PARSEME Shared Task 2018 on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions
    (VMWEs). Veyn is based on a sequence tagger using recurrent neural networks. We
    represent VMWEs using a variant of the begin-inside-outside encoding scheme combined
    with the VMWE category tag. In addition to the system description, we present
    development experiments to determine the best tagging scheme. Veyn is freely available,
    covers 19 languages, and was ranked ninth (MWE-based) and eight (Token-based)
    among 13 submissions, considering macro-averaged F1 across languages.

  abstract: This paper introduces zero-shot dialog generation (ZSDG), as a step towards
    neural dialog systems that can instantly generalize to new situations with minimum
    data. ZSDG requires an end-to-end generative dialog system to generalize to a
    new domain for which only a domain description is provided and no training dialogs
    are available. Then a novel learning framework, Action Matching, is proposed.
    This algorithm can learn a cross-domain embedding space that models the semantics
    of dialog responses which in turn, enables a neural dialog generation model to
    generalize to new domains. We evaluate our methods on two datasets, a new synthetic
    dialog dataset, and an existing human-human multi-domain dialog dataset. Experimental
    results show that our method is able to achieve superior performance in learning
    dialog models that can rapidly adapt their behavior to new domains and suggests
    promising future research.

  abstract: "In cooperative dialogues, identifying the intent of ones conversation\
    \ partner and acting accordingly is of great importance. While this endeavour\
    \ is facilitated by phrasing intentions as directly as possible, we can observe\
    \ in human-human communication that a number of factors such as cultural norms\
    \ and politeness may result in expressing one\u2019s intent indirectly. Therefore,\
    \ in human-computer communication we have to anticipate the possibility of users\
    \ being indirect and be prepared to interpret their actual meaning. Furthermore,\
    \ a dialogue system should be able to conform to human expectations by adjusting\
    \ the degree of directness it uses to improve the user experience. To reach those\
    \ goals, we propose an approach to differentiate between direct and indirect utterances\
    \ and find utterances of the opposite characteristic that express the same intent.\
    \ In this endeavour, we employ dialogue vector models and recurrent neural networks."

  abstract: "Previous work has shown that conversants adapt to many aspects of their\
    \ partners\u2019 language. Other work has shown that while every person is unique,\
    \ they often share general patterns of behavior. Theories of personality aim to\
    \ explain these shared patterns, and studies have shown that many linguistic cues\
    \ are correlated with personality traits. We propose an adaptation measure for\
    \ adaptive natural language generation for dialogs that integrates the predictions\
    \ of both personality theories and adaptation theories, that can be applied as\
    \ a dialog unfolds, on a turn by turn basis. We show that our measure meets criteria\
    \ for validity, and that adaptation varies according to corpora and task, speaker,\
    \ and the set of features used to model it. We also produce fine-grained models\
    \ according to the dialog segmentation or the speaker, and demonstrate the decaying\
    \ trend of adaptation."

  abstract: The role of alignment between interlocutors in second language learning
    is different to that in fluent conversational dialogue. Learners gain linguistic
    skill through increased alignment, yet the extent to which they can align will
    be constrained by their ability. Tutors may use alignment to teach and encourage
    the student, yet still must push the student and correct their errors, decreasing
    alignment. To understand how learner ability interacts with alignment, we measure
    the influence of ability on lexical priming, an indicator of alignment. We find
    that lexical priming in learner-tutor dialogues differs from that in conversational
    and task-based dialogues, and we find evidence that alignment increases with ability
    and with word complexity.

  abstract: Casual conversation has become a focus for artificial dialogue applications.
    Such talk is ubiquitous and its structure differs from that found in the task-based
    interactions which have been the focus of dialogue system design for many years.
    It is unlikely that such conversations can be modelled as an extension of task-based
    talk. We review theories of casual conversation, report on our studies of the
    structure of casual dialogue, and outline challenges we see for the development
    of spoken dialog systems capable of carrying on casual friendly conversation in
    addition to performing well-defined tasks.

  abstract: User Simulators are one of the major tools that enable offline training
    of task-oriented dialogue systems. For this task the Agenda-Based User Simulator
    (ABUS) is often used. The ABUS is based on hand-crafted rules and its output is
    in semantic form. Issues arise from both properties such as limited diversity
    and the inability to interface a text-level belief tracker. This paper introduces
    the Neural User Simulator (NUS) whose behaviour is learned from a corpus and which
    generates natural language, hence needing a less labelled dataset than simulators
    generating a semantic output. In comparison to much of the past work on this topic,
    which evaluates user simulators on corpus-based metrics, we use the NUS to train
    the policy of a reinforcement learning based Spoken Dialogue System. The NUS is
    compared to the ABUS by evaluating the policies that were trained using the simulators.
    Cross-model evaluation is performed i.e. training on one simulator and testing
    on the other. Furthermore, the trained policies are tested on real users. In both
    evaluation tasks the NUS outperformed the ABUS.

  abstract: "To provide a better discussion experience in current argumentative dialogue\
    \ systems, it is necessary for the user to feel motivated to participate, even\
    \ if the system already responds appropriately. In this paper, we propose a method\
    \ that can smoothly introduce argumentative dialogue by inserting an initial discourse,\
    \ consisting of question-answer pairs concerning personality. The system can induce\
    \ interest of the users prior to agreement or disagreement during the main discourse.\
    \ By disclosing their interests, the users will feel familiarity and motivation\
    \ to further engage in the argumentative dialogue and understand the system\u2019\
    s intent. To verify the effectiveness of a question-answer dialogue inserted before\
    \ the argument, a subjective experiment was conducted using a text chat interface.\
    \ The results suggest that inserting the question-answer dialogue enhances familiarity\
    \ and naturalness. Notably, the results suggest that women more than men regard\
    \ the dialogue as more natural and the argument as deepened, following an exchange\
    \ concerning personality."

    \ to address a multimodal, natural language dialogue task in which the agent learns\
    \ complex representations of block structure classes through assertions, demonstrations,\
    \ and questioning. The concept to learn is provided to the user through a set\
    \ of positive and negative visual examples, from which the user determines the\
    \ underlying constraints to be provided to the system in natural language. The\
    \ system in turn asks questions about demonstrated examples and simulates new\
    \ examples to check its knowledge and verify the user\u2019s description is complete.\
    \ We find that this task is non-trivial for users and generates natural language\

  abstract: "Speech overlap is a common phenomenon in natural conversation and in\
    \ task-oriented interactions. As human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes more sophisticated,\
    \ the need to effectively manage turn-taking and resolve overlap becomes more\
    \ important. In this paper, we introduce a computational model for speech overlap\
    \ resolution in embodied artificial agents. The model identifies when overlap\
    \ has occurred and uses timing information, dialogue history, and the agent\u2019\
    s goals to generate context-appropriate behavior. We implement this model in a\
    \ Nao robot using the DIARC cognitive robotic architecture. The model is evaluated\
    \ on a corpus of task-oriented human dialogue, and we find that the robot can\
    \ replicate many of the most common overlap resolution behaviors found in the\
    \ human data."

  abstract: This paper identifies stylistic differences in instruction-giving observed
    in a corpus of human-robot dialogue. Differences in verbosity and structure (i.e.,
    single-intent vs. multi-intent instructions) arose naturally without restrictions
    or prior guidance on how users should speak with the robot. Different styles were
    found to produce different rates of miscommunication, and correlations were found
    between style differences and individual user variation, trust, and interaction
    experience with the robot. Understanding potential consequences and factors that
    influence style can inform design of dialogue systems that are robust to natural
    variation from human users.

  abstract: In this paper, we apply the contribution model of grounding to a corpus
    of human-human peer-mentoring dialogues. From this analysis, we propose effective
    turn-taking strategies for human-robot interaction with a teachable robot. Specifically,
    we focus on (1) how robots can encourage humans to present and (2) how robots
    can signal that they are going to begin a new presentation. We evaluate the strategies
    against a corpus of human-robot dialogues and offer three guidelines for teachable
    robots to follow to achieve more human-like collaborative dialogue.

  abstract: When interacting with robots in a situated spoken dialogue setting, human
    dialogue partners tend to assign anthropomorphic and social characteristics to
    those robots. In this paper, we explore the age and educational level that human
    dialogue partners assign to three different robotic systems, including an un-embodied
    spoken dialogue system. We found that how a robot speaks is as important to human
    perceptions as the way the robot looks. Using the data from our experiment, we
    derived prosodic, emotional, and linguistic features from the participants to
    train and evaluate a classifier that predicts perceived intelligence, age, and
    education level.

  abstract: Creating an intelligent conversational system that understands vision
    and language is one of the ultimate goals in Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Winograd,
    1972). Extensive research has focused on vision-to-language generation, however,
    limited research has touched on combining these two modalities in a goal-driven
    dialog context. We propose a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning framework
    that dynamically integrates vision and language for task-oriented visual dialog.
    The framework jointly learns the multimodal dialog state representation and the
    hierarchical dialog policy to improve both dialog task success and efficiency.
    We also propose a new technique, state adaptation, to integrate context awareness
    in the dialog state representation. We evaluate the proposed framework and the
    state adaptation technique in an image guessing game and achieve promising results.

  abstract: The utility of collaborative manipulators for shared tasks is highly dependent
    on the speed and accuracy of communication between the human and the robot. The
    run-time of recently developed probabilistic inference models for situated symbol
    grounding of natural language instructions depends on the complexity of the representation
    of the environment in which they reason. As we move towards more complex bi-directional
    interactions, tasks, and environments, we need intelligent perception models that
    can selectively infer precise pose, semantics, and affordances of the objects
    when inferring exhaustively detailed world models is inefficient and prohibits
    real-time interaction with these robots. In this paper we propose a model of language
    and perception for the problem of adapting the configuration of the robot perception
    pipeline for tasks where constructing exhaustively detailed models of the environment
    is inefficient and inconsequential for symbol grounding. We present experimental
    results from a synthetic corpus of natural language instructions for robot manipulation
    in example environments. The results demonstrate that by adapting perception we
    get significant gains in terms of run-time for perception and situated symbol
    grounding of the language instructions without a loss in the accuracy of the latter.

  abstract: "Positive emotion elicitation seeks to improve user\u2019s emotional state\
    \ through dialogue system interaction, where a chat-based scenario is layered\
    \ with an implicit goal to address user\u2019s emotional needs. Standard neural\
    \ dialogue system approaches still fall short in this situation as they tend to\
    \ generate only short, generic responses. Learning from expert actions is critical,\
    \ as these potentially differ from standard dialogue acts. In this paper, we propose\
    \ using a hierarchical neural network for response generation that is conditioned\
    \ on 1) expert\u2019s action, 2) dialogue context, and 3) user emotion, encoded\

    \ 30 participants following a negative emotional exposure to learn expert actions\
    \ and responses in a positive emotion elicitation scenario. Instead of relying\
    \ on the expensive, labor intensive, and often ambiguous human annotations, we\

  abstract: We present a model which predicts how individual users of a dialog system
    understand and produce utterances based on user groups. In contrast to previous
    work, these user groups are not specified beforehand, but learned in training.
    We evaluate on two referring expression (RE) generation tasks; our experiments
    show that our model can identify user groups and learn how to most effectively
    talk to them, and can dynamically assign unseen users to the correct groups as
    they interact with the system.

  abstract: 'Natural language generators for task-oriented dialogue must effectively
    realize system dialogue actions and their associated semantics. In many applications,
    it is also desirable for generators to control the style of an utterance. To date,
    work on task-oriented neural generation has primarily focused on semantic fidelity
    rather than achieving stylistic goals, while work on style has been done in contexts
    where it is difficult to measure content preservation. Here we present three different
    sequence-to-sequence models and carefully test how well they disentangle content
    and style. We use a statistical generator, Personage, to synthesize a new corpus
    of over 88,000 restaurant domain utterances whose style varies according to models
    of personality, giving us total control over both the semantic content and the
    stylistic variation in the training data. We then vary the amount of explicit
    stylistic supervision given to the three models. We show that our most explicit
    model can simultaneously achieve high fidelity to both semantic and stylistic
    goals: this model adds a context vector of 36 stylistic parameters as input to
    the hidden state of the encoder at each time step, showing the benefits of explicit
    stylistic supervision, even when the amount of training data is large.'

  abstract: "Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component in spoken\
    \ dialog systems (SDSs). A model for NLG involves sequence to sequence learning.\
    \ State-of-the-art NLG models are built using recurrent neural network (RNN) based\
    \ sequence to sequence models (Ond\u0159ej Du\u0161ek and Filip Jur\u010D\xED\u010D\
    ek, 2016a). Convolutional sequence to sequence based models have been used in\
    \ the domain of machine translation but their application as Natural Language\
    \ Generators in dialogue systems is still unexplored. In this work, we propose\
    \ a novel approach to NLG using convolutional neural network (CNN) based sequence\
    \ to sequence learning. CNN-based approach allows to build a hierarchical model\
    \ which encapsulates dependencies between words via shorter path unlike RNNs.\
    \ In contrast to recurrent models, convolutional approach allows for efficient\
    \ utilization of computational resources by parallelizing computations over all\
    \ elements, and eases the learning process by applying constant number of nonlinearities.\
    \ We also propose to use CNN-based reranker for obtaining responses having semantic\
    \ correspondence with input dialogue acts. The proposed model is capable of entrainment.\
    \ Studies using a standard dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-based\
    \ approach to NLG."

  abstract: In spoken dialog systems (SDSs), dialog act (DA) segmentation and recognition
    provide essential information for response generation. A majority of previous
    works assumed ground-truth segmentation of DA units, which is not available from
    automatic speech recognition (ASR) in SDS. We propose a unified architecture based
    on neural networks, which consists of a sequence tagger for segmentation and a
    classifier for recognition. The DA recognition model is based on hierarchical
    neural networks to incorporate the context of preceding sentences. We investigate
    sharing some layers of the two components so that they can be trained jointly
    and learn generalized features from both tasks. An evaluation on the Switchboard
    Dialog Act (SwDA) corpus shows that the jointly-trained models outperform independently-trained
    models, single-step models, and other reported results in DA segmentation, recognition,
    and joint tasks.

  abstract: Dialogue state tracking (DST), when formulated as a supervised learning
    problem, relies on labelled data. Since dialogue state annotation usually requires
    labelling all turns of a single dialogue and utilizing context information, it
    is very expensive to annotate all available unlabelled data. In this paper, a
    novel cost-sensitive active learning framework is proposed based on a set of new
    dialogue-level query strategies. This is the first attempt to apply active learning
    for dialogue state tracking. Experiments on DSTC2 show that active learning with
    mixed data query strategies can effectively achieve the same DST performance with
    significantly less data annotation compared to traditional training approaches.

  abstract: To date there has been very little work on assessing discourse coherence
    methods on real-world data. To address this, we present a new corpus of real-world
    texts (GCDC) as well as the first large-scale evaluation of leading discourse
    coherence algorithms. We show that neural models, including two that we introduce
    here (SentAvg and ParSeq), tend to perform best. We analyze these performance
    differences and discuss patterns we observed in low coherence texts in four domains.

  abstract: Aiming to expand the current research paradigm for training conversational
    AI agents that can address real-world challenges, we take a step away from traditional
    slot-filling goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems (SDS) and model the dialogue
    in a way that allows users to be more expressive in describing their needs. The
    goal is to help users make informed decisions rather than being fed matching items.
    To this end, we describe the Linked-Data SDS (LD-SDS), a system that exploits
    semantic knowledge bases that connect to linked data, and supports complex constraints
    and preferences. We describe the required changes in language understanding and
    state tracking, and the need for mined features, and we report the promising results
    (in terms of semantic errors, effort, etc) of a preliminary evaluation after training
    two statistical dialogue managers in various conditions.

  abstract: "This paper examines a method to improve the user impression of a spoken\
    \ dialog system by introducing a mechanism that gradually changes form of utterances\
    \ every time the user uses the system. In some languages, including Japanese,\
    \ the form of utterances changes corresponding to social relationship between\
    \ the talker and the listener. Thus, this mechanism can be effective to express\
    \ the system\u2019s intention to make social distance to the user closer; however,\
    \ an actual effect of this method is not investigated enough when introduced to\
    \ the dialog system. In this paper, we conduct dialog experiments and show that\
    \ controlling the form of system utterances can improve the users\u2019 impression."

  abstract: This demonstration paper presents a bilingual (Arabic-English) interactive
    human avatar dialogue system. The system is named TOIA (time-offset interaction
    application), as it simulates face-to-face conversations between humans using
    digital human avatars recorded in the past. TOIA is a conversational agent, similar
    to a chat bot, except that it is based on an actual human being and can be used
    to preserve and tell stories. The system is designed to allow anybody, simply
    using a laptop, to create an avatar of themselves, thus facilitating cross-cultural
    and cross-generational sharing of narratives to wider audiences. The system currently
    supports monolingual and cross-lingual dialogues in Arabic and English, but can
    be extended to other languages.

  abstract: When creating a dialog system, developers need to test each version to
    ensure that it is performing correctly. Recently the trend has been to test on
    large datasets or to ask many users to try out a system. Crowdsourcing has solved
    the issue of finding users, but it presents new challenges such as how to use
    a crowdsourcing platform and what type of test is appropriate. DialCrowd has been
    designed to make system assessment easier and to ensure the quality of the result.
    This paper describes DialCrowd, what specific needs it fulfills and how it works.
    It then relates a test of DialCrowd by a group of dialog system developer.

  abstract: We present a paradigm for interactive teacher training that leverages
    multimodal dialog technology to puppeteer custom-designed embodied conversational
    agents (ECAs) in student roles. We used the open-source multimodal dialog system
    HALEF to implement a small-group classroom math discussion involving Venn diagrams
    where a human teacher candidate has to interact with two student ECAs whose actions
    are controlled by the dialog system. Such an automated paradigm has the potential
    to be extended and scaled to a wide range of interactive simulation scenarios
    in education, medicine, and business where group interaction training is essential.

  abstract: Self-disclosure is a key social strategy employed in conversation to build
    relations and increase conversational depth. It has been heavily studied in psychology
    and linguistic literature, particularly for its ability to induce self-disclosure
    from the recipient, a phenomena known as reciprocity. However, we know little
    about how self-disclosure manifests in conversation with automated dialog systems,
    especially as any self-disclosure on the part of a dialog system is patently disingenuous.
    In this work, we run a large-scale quantitative analysis on the effect of self-disclosure
    by analyzing interactions between real-world users and a spoken dialog system
    in the context of social conversation. We find that indicators of reciprocity
    occur even in human-machine dialog, with far-reaching implications for chatbots
    in a variety of domains including education, negotiation and social dialog.

  abstract: Having consistent personalities is important for chatbots if we want them
    to be believable. Typically, many question-answer pairs are prepared by hand for
    achieving consistent responses; however, the creation of such pairs is costly.
    In this study, our goal is to collect a large number of question-answer pairs
    for a particular character by using role play-based question-answering in which
    multiple users play the roles of certain characters and respond to questions by
    online users. Focusing on two famous characters, we conducted a large-scale experiment
    to collect question-answer pairs by using real users. We evaluated the effectiveness
    of role play-based question-answering and found that, by using our proposed method,
    the collected pairs lead to good-quality chatbots that exhibit consistent personalities.

  abstract: Statistical spoken dialogue systems usually rely on a single- or multi-domain
    dialogue model that is restricted in its capabilities of modelling complex dialogue
    structures, e.g., relations. In this work, we propose a novel dialogue model that
    is centred around entities and is able to model relations as well as multiple
    entities of the same type. We demonstrate in a prototype implementation benefits
    of relation modelling on the dialogue level and show that a trained policy using
    these relations outperforms the multi-domain baseline. Furthermore, we show that
    by modelling the relations on the dialogue level, the system is capable of processing
    relations present in the user input and even learns to address them in the system
    response.

  abstract: In this paper we have proposed a linguistically informed recursive neural
    network architecture for automatic extraction of cause-effect relations from text.
    These relations can be expressed in arbitrarily complex ways. The architecture
    uses word level embeddings and other linguistic features to detect causal events
    and their effects mentioned within a sentence. The extracted events and their
    relations are used to build a causal-graph after clustering and appropriate generalization,
    which is then used for predictive purposes. We have evaluated the performance
    of the proposed extraction model with respect to two baseline systems,one a rule-based
    classifier, and the other a conditional random field (CRF) based supervised model.
    We have also compared our results with related work reported in the past by other
    authors on SEMEVAL data set, and found that the proposed bi-directional LSTM model
    enhanced with an additional linguistic layer performs better. We have also worked
    extensively on creating new annotated datasets from publicly available data, which
    we are willing to share with the community.

  abstract: We present a domain portable zero-shot learning approach for entity recognition
    in task-oriented conversational agents, which does not assume any annotated sentences
    at training time. Rather, we derive a neural model of the entity names based only
    on available gazetteers, and then apply the model to recognize new entities in
    the context of user utterances. In order to evaluate our working hypothesis we
    focus on nominal entities that are largely used in e-commerce to name products.
    Through a set of experiments in two languages (English and Italian) and three
    different domains (furniture, food, clothing), we show that the neural gazetteer-based
    approach outperforms several competitive baselines, with minimal requirements
    of linguistic features.

  abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising dialogue policy optimisation
    approach, but traditional RL algorithms fail to scale to large domains. Recently,
    Feudal Dialogue Management (FDM), has shown to increase the scalability to large
    domains by decomposing the dialogue management decision into two steps, making
    use of the domain ontology to abstract the dialogue state in each step. In order
    to abstract the state space, however, previous work on FDM relies on handcrafted
    feature functions. In this work, we show that these feature functions can be learned
    jointly with the policy model while obtaining similar performance, even outperforming
    the handcrafted features in several environments and domains.

  abstract: Cross-domain natural language generation (NLG) is still a difficult task
    within spoken dialogue modelling. Given a semantic representation provided by
    the dialogue manager, the language generator should generate sentences that convey
    desired information. Traditional template-based generators can produce sentences
    with all necessary information, but these sentences are not sufficiently diverse.
    With RNN-based models, the diversity of the generated sentences can be high, however,
    in the process some information is lost. In this work, we improve an RNN-based
    generator by considering latent information at the sentence level during generation
    using conditional variational auto-encoder architecture. We demonstrate that our
    model outperforms the original RNN-based generator, while yielding highly diverse
    sentences. In addition, our model performs better when the training data is limited.

  abstract: 'The research described in this paper examines how to learn linguistic
    knowledge associated with discourse relations from unlabeled corpora. We introduce
    an unsupervised learning method on text coherence that could produce numerical

    negative sampling tends to be more effective.'

  abstract: In this work, we propose an adversarial learning method for reward estimation
    in reinforcement learning (RL) based task-oriented dialog models. Most of the
    current RL based task-oriented dialog systems require the access to a reward signal
    from either user feedback or user ratings. Such user ratings, however, may not
    always be consistent or available in practice. Furthermore, online dialog policy
    learning with RL typically requires a large number of queries to users, suffering
    from sample efficiency problem. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial
    learning method to learn dialog rewards directly from dialog samples. Such rewards
    are further used to optimize the dialog policy with policy gradient based RL.
    In the evaluation in a restaurant search domain, we show that the proposed adversarial
    dialog learning method achieves advanced dialog success rate comparing to strong
    baseline methods. We further discuss the covariate shift problem in online adversarial
    dialog learning and show how we can address that with partial access to user feedback.

  abstract: We present a new lexicon of English discourse connectives called DiMLex-Eng,
    built by merging information from two annotated corpora and an additional list
    of relation signals from the literature. The format follows the German connective
    lexicon DiMLex, which provides a cross-linguistically applicable XML schema. DiMLex-Eng
    contains 149 English connectives, and gives information on syntactic categories,
    discourse semantics and non-connective uses (if any). We report on the development
    steps and discuss design decisions encountered in the lexicon expansion phase.
    The resource is freely available for use in studies of discourse structure and
    computational applications.

  abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) by using recurrent neural networks
    (RNN) achieves good performances for large training data sets, but collecting
    large training datasets is a challenge, especially for new voice applications.
    Therefore, the purpose of this study is to maximize SLU performances, especially
    for small training data sets. To this aim, we propose a novel CRF-based dialog
    act selector which chooses suitable dialog acts from outputs of RNN SLU and rule-based
    SLU. We evaluate the selector by using DSTC2 corpus when RNN SLU is trained by
    less than 1,000 training sentences. The evaluation demonstrates the selector achieves
    Micro F1 better than both RNN and rule-based SLUs. In addition, it shows the selector
    achieves better Macro F1 than RNN SLU and the same Macro F1 as rule-based SLU.
    Thus, we confirmed our method offers advantages in SLU performances for small
    training data sets.

  abstract: This paper explores the effect of emotional speech synthesis on a spoken
    dialogue system when the dialogue is non-task-oriented. Although the use of emotional
    speech responses have been shown to be effective in a limited domain, e.g., scenario-based
    and counseling dialogue, the effect is still not clear in the non-task-oriented
    dialogue such as voice chatting. For this purpose, we constructed a simple dialogue
    system with example- and rule-based dialogue management. In the system, two types
    of emotion labeling with emotion estimation are adopted, i.e., system-driven and
    user-cooperative emotion labeling. We conducted a dialogue experiment where subjects
    evaluate the subjective quality of the system and the dialogue from the multiple
    aspects such as richness of the dialogue and impression of the agent. We then
    analyze and discuss the results and show the advantage of using appropriate emotions
    for the expressive speech responses in the non-task-oriented system.

  abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task learning of language
    understanding (LU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue
    systems. Multi-task training enables the sharing of the neural network layers
    responsible for encoding the user utterance for both LU and DST and improves performance
    while reducing the number of network parameters. In our proposed framework, DST
    operates on a set of candidate values for each slot that has been mentioned so
    far. These candidate sets are generated using LU slot annotations for the current
    user utterance, dialogue acts corresponding to the preceding system utterance
    and the dialogue state estimated for the previous turn, enabling DST to handle
    slots with a large or unbounded set of possible values and deal with slot values
    not seen during training. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and
    inference, we investigate the use of scheduled sampling on LU output for the current
    user utterance as well as the DST output for the preceding turn.

    instead of simply averaging. Experiments indicate the usefulness of the proposed
    weighted measure and also show that in general a proper weighting of the dyad-level
    measures performs better than non-weighted averaging in multiple tasks.

  abstract: "Concept definition is important in language understanding (LU) adaptation\
    \ since literal definition difference can easily lead to data sparsity even if\
    \ different data sets are actually semantically correlated. To address this issue,\
    \ in this paper, a novel concept transfer learning approach is proposed. Here,\
    \ substructures within literal concept definition are investigated to reveal the\
    \ relationship between concepts. A hierarchical semantic representation for concepts\
    \ is proposed, where a semantic slot is represented as a composition of atomic\
    \ concepts. Based on this new hierarchical representation, transfer learning approaches\
    \ are developed for adaptive LU. The approaches are applied to two tasks: value\
    \ set mismatch and domain adaptation, and evaluated on two LU benchmarks: ATIS\
    \ and DSTC 2&3. Thorough empirical studies validate both the efficiency and effectiveness\
    \ of the proposed method. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art performance\

  abstract: The bulk of current research in dialogue systems is focused on fairly
    simple task models, primarily state-based. Progress on developing dialogue systems
    for more complex tasks has been limited by the lack generic toolkits to build
    from. In this paper we report on our development from the ground up of a new dialogue
    model based on collaborative problem solving. We implemented the model in a dialogue
    system shell (Cogent) that al-lows developers to plug in problem-solving agents
    to create dialogue systems in new domains. The Cogent shell has now been used
    by several independent teams of researchers to develop dialogue systems in different
    domains, with varied lexicons and interaction style, each with their own problem-solving
    back-end. We believe this to be the first practical demonstration of the feasibility
    of a CPS-based dialogue system shell.

    \ updating the belief estimates of user-mentioned slot-value pairs. Given a user\
    \ utterance, the intent of a slot-value pair is captured using dialog acts (DA)\
    \ expressed in that utterance. However, in certain cases, DA\u2019s fail to capture\
    \ the actual update intent of the user. In this paper, we describe such cases\
    \ and propose a new type of semantic class for user intents. This new type, Update\
    \ Intents (UI), is directly related to the type of update a user intends to perform\
    \ for a slot-value pair. We define five types of UI\u2019s, which are independent\
    \ of the domain of the conversation. We build a multi-class classification model\
    \ using LSTM\u2019s to identify the type of UI in user utterances in the Restaurant\
    \ and Shopping domains. Experimental results show that our models achieve strong\
    \ classification performance in terms of F-1 score."

  abstract: The advent of social media in recent years has fed into some highly undesirable
    phenomena such as proliferation of offensive language, hate speech, sexist remarks,
    etc. on the Internet. In light of this, there have been several efforts to automate
    the detection and moderation of such abusive content. However, deliberate obfuscation
    of words by users to evade detection poses a serious challenge to the effectiveness
    of these efforts. The current state of the art approaches to abusive language
    detection, based on recurrent neural networks, do not explicitly address this
    problem and resort to a generic OOV (out of vocabulary) embedding for unseen words.
    However, in using a single embedding for all unseen words we lose the ability
    to distinguish between obfuscated and non-obfuscated or rare words. In this paper,
    we address this problem by designing a model that can compose embeddings for unseen
    words. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach significantly advances
    the current state of the art in abuse detection on datasets from two different
    domains, namely Twitter and Wikipedia talk page.

  abstract: Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a
    target group of people based on some characteristic such as race, colour, ethnicity,
    gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristic. Due
    to the massive rise of user-generated web content on social media, the amount
    of hate speech is also steadily increasing. Over the past years, interest in online
    hate speech detection and, particularly, the automation of this task has continuously
    grown, along with the societal impact of the phenomenon. This paper describes
    a hate speech dataset composed of thousands of sentences manually labelled as
    containing hate speech or not. The sentences have been extracted from Stormfront,
    a white supremacist forum. A custom annotation tool has been developed to carry
    out the manual labelling task which, among other things, allows the annotators
    to choose whether to read the context of a sentence before labelling it. The paper
    also provides a thoughtful qualitative and quantitative study of the resulting
    dataset and several baseline experiments with different classification models.
    The dataset is publicly available.

  abstract: "Language toxicity identification presents a gray area in the ethical\
    \ debate surrounding freedom of speech and censorship. Today\u2019s social media\
    \ landscape is littered with unfiltered content that can be anywhere from slightly\
    \ abusive to hate inducing. In response, we focused on training a multi-label\
    \ classifier to detect both the type and level of toxicity in online content.\
    \ This content is typically colloquial and conversational in style. Its classification\
    \ therefore requires huge amounts of annotated data due to its variability and\
    \ inconsistency. We compare standard methods of text classification in this task.\
    \ A conventional one-vs-rest SVM classifier with character and word level frequency-based\
    \ representation of text reaches 0.9763 ROC AUC score. We demonstrated that leveraging\
    \ more advanced technologies such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks,\
    \ attention mechanism, stacking of classifiers and semi-supervised training can\
    \ improve the ROC AUC score of classification to 0.9862. We suggest that in order\
    \ to choose the right model one has to consider the accuracy of models as well\
    \ as inference complexity based on the application."

  abstract: We present a neural-network based approach to classifying online hate
    speech in general, as well as racist and sexist speech in particular. Using pre-trained
    word embeddings and max/mean pooling from simple, fully-connected transformations
    of these embeddings, we are able to predict the occurrence of hate speech on three
    commonly used publicly available datasets. Our models match or outperform state
    of the art F1 performance on all three datasets using significantly fewer parameters
    and minimal feature preprocessing compared to previous methods.

  abstract: Although WhatsApp is used by teenagers as one major channel of cyberbullying,
    such interactions remain invisible due to the app privacy policies that do not
    allow ex-post data collection. Indeed, most of the information on these phenomena
    rely on surveys regarding self-reported data. In order to overcome this limitation,
    we describe in this paper the activities that led to the creation of a WhatsApp
    dataset to study cyberbullying among Italian students aged 12-13. We present not
    only the collected chats with annotations about user role and type of offense,
    but also the living lab created in a collaboration between researchers and schools
    to monitor and analyse cyberbullying. Finally, we discuss some open issues, dealing
    with ethical, operational and epistemic aspects.

  abstract: Growing amount of comments make online discussions difficult to moderate
    by human moderators only. Antisocial behavior is a common occurrence that often
    discourages other users from participating in discussion. We propose a neural
    network based method that partially automates the moderation process. It consists
    of two steps. First, we detect inappropriate comments for moderators to see. Second,
    we highlight inappropriate parts within these comments to make the moderation
    faster. We evaluated our method on data from a major Slovak news discussion platform.

  abstract: We probe the heterogeneity in levels of abusive language in different
    sections of the Internet, using an annotated corpus of Wikipedia page edit comments
    to train a binary classifier for abuse detection. Our test data come from the
    CrimeBB Corpus of hacking-related forum posts and we find that (a) forum interactions
    are rarely abusive, (b) the abusive language which does exist tends to be relatively
    mild compared to that found in the Wikipedia comments domain, and tends to involve
    aggressive posturing rather than hate speech or threats of violence. We observe
    that the purpose of conversations in online forums tend to be more constructive
    and informative than those in Wikipedia page edit comments which are geared more
    towards adversarial interactions, and that this may explain the lower levels of
    abuse found in our forum data than in Wikipedia comments. Further work remains
    to be done to compare these results with other inter-domain classification experiments,
    and to understand the impact of aggressive language in forum conversations.

  abstract: The paper investigates the potential effects user features have on hate
    speech classification. A quantitative analysis of Twitter data was conducted to
    better understand user characteristics, but no correlations were found between
    hateful text and the characteristics of the users who had posted it. However,
    experiments with a hate speech classifier based on datasets from three different
    languages showed that combining certain user features with textual features gave
    slight improvements of classification performance. While the incorporation of
    user features resulted in varying impact on performance for the different datasets
    used, user network-related features provided the most consistent improvements.

  abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to hate speech detection with apparent
    success, but they have limited practical applicability without transparency into
    the predictions they make. In this paper, we perform several experiments to visualize
    and understand a state-of-the-art neural network classifier for hate speech (Zhang
    et al., 2018). We adapt techniques from computer vision to visualize sensitive
    regions of the input stimuli and identify the features learned by individual neurons.
    We also introduce a method to discover the keywords that are most predictive of
    hate speech. Our analyses explain the aspects of neural networks that work well
    and point out areas for further improvement.

  abstract: 'While analysis of online explicit abusive language detection has lately
    seen an ever-increasing focus, implicit abuse detection remains a largely unexplored
    space. We carry out a study on a subcategory of implicit hate: euphemistic hate
    speech. We propose a method to assist in identifying unknown euphemisms (or code
    words) given a set of hateful tweets containing a known code word. Our approach
    leverages word embeddings and network analysis (through centrality measures and
    community detection) in a manner that can be generalized to identify euphemisms
    across contexts- not just hate speech.'

  abstract: The context-dependent nature of online aggression makes annotating large
    collections of data extremely difficult. Previously studied datasets in abusive
    language detection have been insufficient in size to efficiently train deep learning
    models. Recently, Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset much greater in
    size and reliability, has been released. However, this dataset has not been comprehensively
    studied to its potential. In this paper, we conduct the first comparative study
    of various learning models on Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, and discuss
    the possibility of using additional features and context data for improvements.
    Experimental results show that bidirectional GRU networks trained on word-level
    features, with Latent Topic Clustering modules, is the most accurate model scoring
    0.805 F1.

  abstract: Text classification models have been heavily utilized for a slew of interesting
    natural language processing problems. Like any other machine learning model, these
    classifiers are very dependent on the size and quality of the training dataset.
    Insufficient and imbalanced datasets will lead to poor performance. An interesting
    solution to poor datasets is to take advantage of the world knowledge in the form
    of knowledge graphs to improve our training data. In this paper, we use ConceptNet
    and Wikidata to improve sexist tweet classification by two methods (1) text augmentation
    and (2) text generation. In our text generation approach, we generate new tweets
    by replacing words using data acquired from ConceptNet relations in order to increase
    the size of our training set, this method is very helpful with frustratingly small
    datasets, preserves the label and increases diversity. In our text augmentation
    approach, the number of tweets remains the same but their words are augmented
    (concatenation) with words extracted from their ConceptNet relations and their
    description extracted from Wikidata. In our text augmentation approach, the number
    of tweets in each class remains the same but the range of each tweet increases.
    Our experiments show that our approach improves sexist tweet classification significantly
    in our entire machine learning models. Our approach can be readily applied to
    any other small dataset size like hate speech or abusive language and text classification
    problem using any machine learning model.

  abstract: This paper discusses the question whether it is possible to learn a generic
    representation that is useful for detecting various types of abusive language.
    The approach is inspired by recent advances in transfer learning and word embeddings,
    and we learn representations from two different datasets containing various degrees
    of abusive language. We compare the learned representation with two standard approaches;
    one based on lexica, and one based on data-specific n-grams. Our experiments show
    that learned representations -grams. Our experiments show that learned representations
    do contain useful information that can be used to improve detection performance
    when training data is limited.

  abstract: 'This paper presents two large newly constructed datasets of moderated
    news comments from two highly popular online news portals in the respective countries:
    the Slovene RTV MCC and the Croatian 24sata. The datasets are analyzed by performing
    manual annotation of the types of the content which have been deleted by moderators
    and by investigating deletion trends among users and threads. Next, initial experiments
    on automatically detecting the deleted content in the datasets are presented.
    Both datasets are published in encrypted form, to enable others to perform experiments
    on detecting content to be deleted without revealing potentially inappropriate
    content. Finally, the baseline classification models trained on the non-encrypted
    datasets are disseminated as well to enable real-world use.'

  abstract: We investigate to what extent the models trained to detect general abusive
    language generalize between different datasets labeled with different abusive
    language types. To this end, we compare the cross-domain performance of simple
    classification models on nine different datasets, finding that the models fail
    to generalize to out-domain datasets and that having at least some in-domain data
    is important. We also show that using the frustratingly simple domain adaptation
    (Daume III, 2007) in most cases improves the results over in-domain training,
    especially when used to augment a smaller dataset with a larger one.

  abstract: The use of code-switched languages (e.g., Hinglish, which is derived by
    the blending of Hindi with the English language) is getting much popular on Twitter
    due to their ease of communication in native languages. However, spelling variations
    and absence of grammar rules introduce ambiguity and make it difficult to understand
    the text automatically. This paper presents the Multi-Input Multi-Channel Transfer
    Learning based model (MIMCT) to detect offensive (hate speech or abusive) Hinglish
    tweets from the proposed Hinglish Offensive Tweet (HOT) dataset using transfer
    learning coupled with multiple feature inputs. Specifically, it takes multiple
    primary word embedding along with secondary extracted features as inputs to train
    a multi-channel CNN-LSTM architecture that has been pre-trained on English tweets
    through transfer learning. The proposed MIMCT model outperforms the baseline supervised
    classification models, transfer learning based CNN and LSTM models to establish
    itself as the state of the art in the unexplored domain of Hinglish offensive
    text classification.

  abstract: Automated filters are commonly used by online services to stop users from
    sending age-inappropriate, bullying messages, or asking others to expose personal
    information. Previous work has focused on rules or classifiers to detect and filter
    offensive messages, but these are vulnerable to cleverly disguised plaintext and
    unseen expressions especially in an adversarial setting where the users can repeatedly
    try to bypass the filter. In this paper, we model the disguised messages as if
    they are produced by encrypting the original message using an invented cipher.
    We apply automatic decipherment techniques to decode the disguised malicious text,
    which can be then filtered using rules or classifiers. We provide experimental
    results on three different datasets and show that decipherment is an effective
    tool for this task.

  abstract: We explore the use of residual networks for argumentation mining, with
    an emphasis on link prediction. The method we propose makes no assumptions on
    document or argument structure. We evaluate it on a challenging dataset consisting
    of user-generated comments collected from an online platform. Results show that
    our model outperforms an equivalent deep network and offers results comparable
    with state-of-the-art methods that rely on domain knowledge.

  abstract: 'Argument Mining (AM) is a relatively recent discipline, which concentrates
    on extracting claims or premises from discourses, and inferring their structures.
    However, many existing works do not consider micro-level AM studies on discussion
    threads sufficiently. In this paper, we tackle AM for discussion threads. Our
    main contributions are follows: (1) A novel combination scheme focusing on micro-level
    inner- and inter- post schemes for a discussion thread. (2) Annotation of large-scale
    civic discussion threads with the scheme. (3) Parallel constrained pointer architecture
    (PCPA), a novel end-to-end technique to discriminate sentence types, inner-post
    relations, and inter-post interactions simultaneously. The experimental results
    demonstrate that our proposed model shows better accuracy in terms of relations
    extraction, in comparison to existing state-of-the-art models.'

  abstract: 'Argumentation is arguably one of the central features of scientific language.
    We present ArguminSci, an easy-to-use tool that analyzes argumentation and other
    rhetorical aspects of scientific writing, which we collectively dub scitorics.
    The main aspect we focus on is the fine-grained argumentative analysis of scientific
    text through identification of argument components. The functionality of ArguminSci
    is accessible via three interfaces: as a command line tool, via a RESTful application
    programming interface, and as a web application.'

  abstract: 'Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) are a common type of experimental
    studies in the medical domain for evidence-based decision making. The ability
    to automatically extract the arguments proposed therein can be of valuable support
    for clinicians and practitioners in their daily evidence-based decision making
    activities. Given the peculiarity of the medical domain and the required level
    of detail, standard approaches to argument component detection in argument(ation)
    mining are not fine-grained enough to support such activities. In this paper,
    we introduce a new sub-task of the argument component identification task: evidence
    type classification. To address it, we propose a supervised approach and we test
    it on a set of RCT abstracts on different medical topics.'

  abstract: Internet users generate content at unprecedented rates. Building intelligent
    systems capable of discriminating useful content within this ocean of information
    is thus becoming a urgent need. In this paper, we aim to predict the usefulness
    of Amazon reviews, and to do this we exploit features coming from an off-the-shelf
    argumentation mining system. We argue that the usefulness of a review, in fact,
    is strictly related to its argumentative content, whereas the use of an already
    trained system avoids the costly need of relabeling a novel dataset. Results obtained
    on a large publicly available corpus support this hypothesis.

  abstract: Argumentation is an essential feature of scientific language. We present
    an annotation study resulting in a corpus of scientific publications annotated
    with argumentative components and relations. The argumentative annotations have
    been added to the existing Dr. Inventor Corpus, already annotated for four other
    rhetorical aspects. We analyze the annotated argumentative structures and investigate
    the relations between argumentation and other rhetorical aspects of scientific
    writing, such as discourse roles and citation contexts.

  abstract: In this paper we present annotation experiments with three different annotation
    schemes for the identification of argument components in texts related to the
    vaccination debate. Identifying claims about vaccinations made by participants
    in the debate is of great societal interest, as the decision to vaccinate or not
    has impact in public health and safety. Since most corpora that have been annotated
    with argumentation information contain texts that belong to a specific genre and
    have a well defined argumentation structure, we needed to adjust the annotation
    schemes to our corpus, which contains heterogeneous texts from the Web. We started
    with a complex annotation scheme that had to be simplified due to low IAA. In
    our final experiment, which focused on annotating claims, annotators reached 57.3%
    IAA.

  abstract: 'This paper focuses on argument component classification for transcribed
    spoken classroom discussions, with the goal of automatically classifying student
    utterances into claims, evidence, and warrants. We show that an existing method
    for argument component classification developed for another educationally-oriented
    domain performs poorly on our dataset. We then show that feature sets from prior
    work on argument mining for student essays and online dialogues can be used to
    improve performance considerably. We also provide a comparison between convolutional
    neural networks and recurrent neural networks when trained under different conditions
    to classify argument components in classroom discussions. While neural network
    models are not always able to outperform a logistic regression model, we were
    able to gain some useful insights: convolutional networks are more robust than
    recurrent networks both at the character and at the word level, and specificity
    information can help boost performance in multi-task training.'

  abstract: "Most of the existing works on argument mining cast the problem of argumentative\
    \ structure identification as classification tasks (e.g. attack-support relations,\
    \ stance, explicit premise/claim). This paper goes a step further by addressing\
    \ the task of automatically identifying reasoning patterns of arguments using\
    \ predefined templates, which is called argument template (AT) instantiation.\
    \ The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we develop a simple, yet\
    \ expressive set of easily annotatable ATs that can represent a majority of writer\u2019\
    s reasoning for texts with diverse policy topics while maintaining the computational\
    \ feasibility of the task. Second, we create a small, but highly reliable annotated\
    \ corpus of instantiated ATs on top of reliably annotated support and attack relations\
    \ and conduct an annotation study. Third, we formulate the task of AT instantiation\
    \ as structured prediction constrained by a feasible set of templates. Our evaluation\
    \ demonstrates that we can annotate ATs with a reasonably high inter-annotator\
    \ agreement, and the use of template-constrained inference is useful for instantiating\
    \ ATs with only partial reasoning comprehension clues."

  abstract: 'Common-sense argumentative reasoning is a challenging task that requires
    holistic understanding of the argumentation where external knowledge about the
    world is hypothesized to play a key role. We explore the idea of using event knowledge
    about prototypical situations from FrameNet and fact knowledge about concrete
    entities from Wikidata to solve the task. We find that both resources can contribute
    to an improvement over the non-enriched approach and point out two persisting
    challenges: first, integration of many annotations of the same type, and second,
    fusion of complementary annotations. After our explorations, we question the key
    role of external world knowledge with respect to the argumentative reasoning task
    and rather point towards a logic-based analysis of the chain of reasoning.'

  abstract: In this paper, we propose to incorporate topic aspects information for
    online comments convincingness evaluation. Our model makes use of graph convolutional
    network to utilize implicit topic information within a discussion thread to assist
    the evaluation of convincingness of each single comment. In order to test the
    effectiveness of our proposed model, we annotate topic information on top of a
    public dataset for argument convincingness evaluation. Experimental results show
    that topic information is able to improve the performance for convincingness evaluation.
    We also make a move to detect topic aspects automatically.

    and a copy of the annotated article are now publically available.

  abstract: We created a corpus of utterances that attempt to save face from parliamentary
    debates and use it to automatically analyze the language of reputation defence.
    Our proposed model that incorporates information regarding threats to reputation
    can predict reputation defence language with high confidence. Further experiments
    and evaluations on different datasets show that the model is able to generalize
    to new utterances and can predict the language of reputation defence in a new
    dataset.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of developing an argumentative dialogue
    agent that can be able to discuss with human users on controversial topics. We
    describe two systems that use retrieval-based and generative models to make argumentative
    responses to the users. The experiments show promising results although they have
    been trained on a small dataset.

  abstract: We consider unsupervised cross-lingual transfer on two tasks, viz., sentence-level
    argumentation mining and standard POS tagging. We combine direct transfer using
    bilingual embeddings with annotation projection, which projects labels across
    unlabeled parallel data. We do so by either merging respective source and target
    language datasets or alternatively by using multi-task learning. Our combination
    strategy considerably improves upon both direct transfer and projection with few
    available parallel sentences, the most realistic scenario for many low-resource
    target languages.

  abstract: 'Argument mining aims to detect and identify argument structures from
    textual resources. In this paper, we aim to address the task of argumentative
    relation identification, a subtask of argument mining, for which several approaches
    have been recently proposed in a monolingual setting. To overcome the lack of
    annotated resources in less-resourced languages, we present the first attempt
    to address this subtask in a cross-lingual setting. We compare two standard strategies
    for cross-language learning, namely: projection and direct-transfer. Experimental
    results show that by using unsupervised language adaptation the proposed approaches
    perform at a competitive level when compared with fully-supervised in-language
    learning settings.'

    texts that had originally been built in a controlled text production experiment.
    Our extension more than doubles the size of the corpus by means of crowdsourcing.
    We report on the setup of this experiment and on the consequences that crowdsourcing
    had for assembling the data, and in particular for annotation. We labeled the
    argumentative structure by marking claims, premises, and relations between them,
    following the scheme used in the original corpus, but had to make a few modifications
    in response to interesting phenomena in the data. Finally, we report on an experiment

    the approach of an earlier study on the original corpus, and compare the performance

  abstract: Question answering (QA) systems usually rely on advanced natural language
    processing components to precisely understand the questions and extract the answers.
    Semantic role labeling (SRL) is known to boost performance for QA, but its use
    for biomedical texts has not yet been fully studied. We analyzed the performance
    of three SRL tools (BioKIT, BIOSMILE and PathLSTM) on 1776 questions from the
    BioASQ challenge. We compared the systems regarding the coverage of the questions
    and snippets, as well as based on pre-defined criteria, such as easiness of installation,
    supported formats and usability. Finally, we integrated two of the tools in a
    simple QA system to further evaluate their performance over the official BioASQ
    test sets.

  abstract: Biomedical Question Answering is concerned with the development of methods
    and systems that automatically find answers to natural language posed questions.
    In this work, we describe the system used in the BioASQ Challenge task 6b for
    document retrieval and snippet retrieval (with particular emphasis in this subtask).
    The proposed model makes use of semantic similarity patterns that are evaluated
    and measured by a convolutional neural network architecture. Subsequently, the
    snippet ranking performance is improved with a pseudo-relevance feedback approach
    in a later step. Based on the preliminary results, we reached the second position
    in snippet retrieval sub-task.

    \ manual annotation, including the NLM official tool \u2013 Medical Text Indexer,\
    \ and the winner of BioASQ Task5a challenge \u2013 DeepMeSH. However, these models\
    \ are complex and not interpretable. We propose a novel end-to-end model, AttentionMeSH,\
    \ which utilizes deep learning and attention mechanism to index MeSH terms to\
    \ biomedical text. The attention mechanism enables the model to associate textual\
    \ evidence with annotations, thus providing interpretability at the word level.\
    \ The model also uses a novel masking mechanism to enhance accuracy and speed.\
    \ In the final week of BioASQ Chanllenge Task6a, we ranked 2nd by average MiF\
    \ using an on-construction model. After the contest, we achieve close to state-of-the-art\
    \ MiF performance of \u223C 0.684 using our final model. Human evaluations show\
    \ AttentionMeSH also provides high level of interpretability, retrieving about\
    \ 90% of all expert-labeled relevant words given an MeSH-article pair at 20 output."

  abstract: "The growing number of biomedical publications is a challenge for human\
    \ researchers, who invest considerable effort to search for relevant documents\
    \ and pinpointed answers. Biomedical Question Answering can automatically generate\
    \ answers for a user\u2019s topic or question, significantly reducing the effort\

    \ Extractive summarization techniques, which concatenate the most relevant text\
    \ units drawn from multiple documents, perform well on automatic evaluation metrics\
    \ like ROUGE, but score poorly on human readability, due to the presence of redundant\
    \ text and grammatical errors in the answer. This work moves toward abstractive\
    \ summarization, which attempts to distill and present the meaning of the original\
    \ text in a more coherent way. We incorporate a sentence fusion approach, based\
    \ on Integer Linear Programming, along with three novel approaches for sentence\
    \ ordering, in an attempt to improve the human readability of ideal answers. Using\
    \ an open framework for configuration space exploration (BOOM), we tested over\
    \ 2000 unique system configurations in order to identify the best-performing combinations\

  abstract: The ever-increasing magnitude of biomedical information sources makes
    it difficult and time-consuming for a human researcher to find the most relevant
    documents and pinpointed answers for a specific question or topic when using only
    a traditional search engine. Biomedical Question Answering systems automatically
    identify the most relevant documents and pinpointed answers, given an information
    need expressed as a natural language question. Generating a non-redundant, human-readable
    summary that satisfies the information need of a given biomedical question is
    the focus of the Ideal Answer Generation task, part of the BioASQ challenge. This
    paper presents a system for ideal answer generation (using ontology-based retrieval
    and a neural learning-to-rank approach, combined with extractive and abstractive
    summarization techniques) which achieved the highest ROUGE score of 0.659 on the
    BioASQ 5b batch 2 test.

  abstract: This work aims to contribute to our understanding of when multi-task learning
    through parameter sharing in deep neural networks leads to improvements over single-task
    learning. We focus on the setting of learning from loosely related tasks, for
    which no theoretical guarantees exist. We therefore approach the question empirically,
    studying which properties of datasets and single-task learning characteristics
    correlate with improvements from multi-task learning. We are the first to study
    this in a text classification setting and across more than 500 different task
    pairs.

  abstract: 'This paper addresses a relatively new task: prediction of ASR performance
    on unseen broadcast programs. In a previous paper, we presented an ASR performance
    prediction system using CNNs that encode both text (ASR transcript) and speech,
    in order to predict word error rate. This work is dedicated to the analysis of
    speech signal embeddings and text embeddings learnt by the CNN while training
    our prediction model. We try to better understand which information is captured
    by the deep model and its relation with different conditioning factors. It is
    shown that hidden layers convey a clear signal about speech style, accent and
    broadcast type. We then try to leverage these 3 types of information at training
    time through multi-task learning. Our experiments show that this allows to train
    slightly more efficient ASR performance prediction systems that - in addition
    - simultaneously tag the analyzed utterances according to their speech style,
    accent and broadcast program origin.'

  abstract: 'Nonlinear methods such as deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art
    performances in several semantic NLP tasks. However epistemologically transparent
    decisions are not provided as for the limited interpretability of the underlying
    acquired neural models. In neural-based semantic inference tasks epistemological
    transparency corresponds to the ability of tracing back causal connections between
    the linguistic properties of a input instance and the produced classification
    output. In this paper, we propose the use of a methodology, called Layerwise Relevance
    Propagation, over linguistically motivated neural architectures, namely Kernel-based
    Deep Architectures (KDA), to guide argumentations and explanation inferences.
    In such a way, each decision provided by a KDA can be linked to real examples,
    linguistically related to the input instance: these can be used to motivate the
    network output. Quantitative analysis shows that richer explanations about the
    semantic and syntagmatic structures of the examples characterize more convincing
    arguments in two tasks, i.e. question classification and semantic role labeling.'

  abstract: Punctuation is a strong indicator of syntactic structure, and parsers
    trained on text with punctuation often rely heavily on this signal. Punctuation
    is a diversion, however, since human language processing does not rely on punctuation
    to the same extent, and in informal texts, we therefore often leave out punctuation.
    We also use punctuation ungrammatically for emphatic or creative purposes, or
    simply by mistake. We show that (a) dependency parsers are sensitive to both absence
    of punctuation and to alternative uses; (b) neural parsers tend to be more sensitive
    than vintage parsers; (c) training neural parsers without punctuation outperforms
    all out-of-the-box parsers across all scenarios where punctuation departs from
    standard punctuation. Our main experiments are on synthetically corrupted data
    to study the effect of punctuation in isolation and avoid potential confounds,
    but we also show effects on out-of-domain data.

    \ given layer of a neural network. While current techniques to evaluate such representations\
    \ focus on their performance on particular tasks, they don\u2019t provide a clear\
    \ understanding of the level of informational detail that is stored within them,\
    \ especially their ability to represent spatial information. The central premise\
    \ of this paper is that visual inspection or analysis is the most convenient method\

    \ text-to-image neural networks, we propose a new technique to compare the quality\
    \ of textual representations by visualizing their information content. The method\
    \ is illustrated on a medical dataset where the correct representation of spatial\
    \ information and shorthands are of particular importance. For four different\
    \ well-known textual representations, we show with a quantitative analysis that\
    \ some representations are consistently able to deliver higher quality visualizations\
    \ of the information content. Additionally, we show that the quantitative analysis\
    \ technique correlates with the judgment of a human expert evaluator in terms\
    \ of alignment."

  abstract: Text preprocessing is often the first step in the pipeline of a Natural
    Language Processing (NLP) system, with potential impact in its final performance.
    Despite its importance, text preprocessing has not received much attention in
    the deep learning literature. In this paper we investigate the impact of simple
    text preprocessing decisions (particularly tokenizing, lemmatizing, lowercasing
    and multiword grouping) on the performance of a standard neural text classifier.
    We perform an extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks from text categorization
    and sentiment analysis. While our experiments show that a simple tokenization
    of input text is generally adequate, they also highlight significant degrees of
    variability across preprocessing techniques. This reveals the importance of paying
    attention to this usually-overlooked step in the pipeline, particularly when comparing
    different models. Finally, our evaluation provides insights into the best preprocessing
    practices for training word embeddings.

  abstract: Lake and Baroni (2018) recently introduced the SCAN data set, which consists
    of simple commands paired with action sequences and is intended to test the strong
    generalization abilities of recurrent sequence-to-sequence models. Their initial
    experiments suggested that such models may fail because they lack the ability
    to extract systematic rules. Here, we take a closer look at SCAN and show that
    it does not always capture the kind of generalization that it was designed for.
    To mitigate this we propose a complementary dataset, which requires mapping actions
    back to the original commands, called NACS. We show that models that do well on
    SCAN do not necessarily do well on NACS, and that NACS exhibits properties more
    closely aligned with realistic use-cases for sequence-to-sequence models.

  abstract: 'We present an analysis into the inner workings of Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNNs) for processing text. CNNs used for computer vision can be interpreted
    by projecting filters into image space, but for discrete sequence inputs CNNs
    remain a mystery. We aim to understand the method by which the networks process
    and classify text. We examine common hypotheses to this problem: that filters,
    accompanied by global max-pooling, serve as ngram detectors. We show that filters
    may capture several different semantic classes of ngrams by using different activation
    patterns, and that global max-pooling induces behavior which separates important
    ngrams from the rest. Finally, we show practical use cases derived from our findings
    in the form of model interpretability (explaining a trained model by deriving
    a concrete identity for each filter, bridging the gap between visualization tools
    in vision tasks and NLP) and prediction interpretability (explaining predictions).'

  abstract: Sluicing resolution is the task of identifying the antecedent to a question
    ellipsis. Antecedents are often sentential constituents, and previous work has
    therefore relied on syntactic parsing, together with complex linguistic features.
    A recent model instead used partial parsing as an auxiliary task in sequential
    neural network architectures to inject syntactic information. We explore the linguistic
    information being brought to bear by such networks, both by defining subsets of
    the data exhibiting relevant linguistic characteristics, and by examining the
    internal representations of the network. Both perspectives provide evidence for
    substantial linguistic knowledge being deployed by the neural networks.

  abstract: Developing a method for understanding the inner workings of black-box
    neural methods is an important research endeavor. Conventionally, many studies
    have used an attention matrix to interpret how Encoder-Decoder-based models translate
    a given source sentence to the corresponding target sentence. However, recent
    studies have empirically revealed that an attention matrix is not optimal for
    token-wise translation analyses. We propose a method that explicitly models the
    token-wise alignment between the source and target sequences to provide a better
    analysis. Experiments show that our method can acquire token-wise alignments that
    are superior to those of an attention mechanism.

  abstract: "Understanding the behavior of a trained network and finding explanations\
    \ for its outputs is important for improving the network\u2019s performance and\
    \ generalization ability, and for ensuring trust in automated systems. Several\
    \ approaches have previously been proposed to identify and visualize the most\
    \ important features by analyzing a trained network. However, the relations between\
    \ different features and classes are lost in most cases. We propose a technique\
    \ to induce sets of if-then-else rules that capture these relations to globally\
    \ explain the predictions of a network. We first calculate the importance of the\
    \ features in the trained network. We then weigh the original inputs with these\
    \ feature importance scores, simplify the transformed input space, and finally\
    \ fit a rule induction model to explain the model predictions. We find that the\
    \ output rule-sets can explain the predictions of a neural network trained for\
    \ 4-class text classification from the 20 newsgroups dataset to a macro-averaged\
    \ F-score of 0.80. We make the code available at https://github.com/clips/interpret_with_rules."

    \ raises the questions: to what extent can these models implicitly learn hierarchical\

    \ can they acquire? We focus on the task of agreement prediction in Basque, as\
    \ a case study for a task that requires implicit understanding of sentence structure\
    \ and the acquisition of a complex but consistent morphological system. Analyzing\

    \ worse on agreement prediction in Basque than one might expect on the basis of\
    \ a previous agreement prediction work in English. Tentative findings based on\
    \ diagnostic classifiers suggest the network makes use of local heuristics as\
    \ a proxy for the hierarchical structure of the sentence. We propose the Basque\
    \ agreement prediction task as challenging benchmark for models that attempt to\
    \ learn regularities in human language."

  abstract: "Systematic compositionality is the ability to recombine meaningful units\

    \ has studied systematic compositionality in modern seq2seq models using generalization\
    \ to novel navigation instructions in a grounded environment as a probing tool.\
    \ Lake and Baroni\u2019s main experiment required the models to quickly bootstrap\
    \ the meaning of new words. We extend this framework here to settings where the\
    \ model needs only to recombine well-trained functional words (such as \u201C\
    around\u201D and \u201Cright\u201D) in novel contexts. Our findings confirm and\
    \ strengthen the earlier ones: seq2seq models can be impressively good at generalizing\
    \ to novel combinations of previously-seen input, but only when they receive extensive\
    \ training on the specific pattern to be generalized (e.g., generalizing from\
    \ many examples of \u201CX around right\u201D to \u201Cjump around right\u201D\
    ), while failing when generalization requires novel application of compositional\

    \ \u201Cright\u201D and \u201Caround\u201D)."

  abstract: "While long short-term memory (LSTM) neural net architectures are designed\
    \ to capture sequence information, human language is generally composed of hierarchical\
    \ structures. This raises the question as to whether LSTMs can learn hierarchical\
    \ structures. We explore this question with a well-formed bracket prediction task\
    \ using two types of brackets modeled by an LSTM. Demonstrating that such a system\
    \ is learnable by an LSTM is the first step in demonstrating that the entire class\
    \ of CFLs is also learnable. We observe that the model requires exponential memory\
    \ in terms of the number of characters and embedded depth, where a sub-linear\
    \ memory should suffice. Still, the model does more than memorize the training\
    \ input. It learns how to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information.\
    \ On the other hand, we also observe that the model does not generalize well.\
    \ We conclude that LSTMs do not learn the relevant underlying context-free rules,\
    \ suggesting the good overall performance is attained rather by an efficient way\
    \ of evaluating nuisance variables. LSTMs are a way to quickly reach good results\
    \ for many natural language tasks, but to understand and generate natural language\
    \ one has to investigate other concepts that can make more direct use of natural\

  abstract: "How much does \u201Cfree shipping!\u201D help an advertisement\u2019\
    s ability to persuade? This paper presents two methods for performance attribution:\
    \ finding the degree to which an outcome can be attributed to parts of a text\
    \ while controlling for potential confounders. Both algorithms are based on interpreting\
    \ the behaviors and parameters of trained neural networks. One method uses a CNN\
    \ to encode the text, an adversarial objective function to control for confounders,\
    \ and projects its weights onto its activations to interpret the importance of\
    \ each phrase towards each output class. The other method leverages residualization\
    \ to control for confounds and performs interpretation by aggregating over learned\
    \ word vectors. We demonstrate these algorithms\u2019 efficacy on 118,000 internet\
    \ search advertisements and outcomes, finding language indicative of high and\
    \ low click through rate (CTR) regardless of who the ad is by or what it is for.\
    \ Our results suggest the proposed algorithms are high performance and data efficient,\
    \ able to glean actionable insights from fewer than 10,000 data points. We find\
    \ that quick, easy, and authoritative language is associated with success, while\
    \ lackluster embellishment is related to failure. These findings agree with the\
    \ advertising industry\u2019s emperical wisdom, automatically revealing insights\
    \ which previously required manual A/B testing to discover."

  abstract: Local model interpretation methods explain individual predictions by assigning
    an importance value to each input feature. This value is often determined by measuring
    the change in confidence when a feature is removed. However, the confidence of
    neural networks is not a robust measure of model uncertainty. This issue makes
    reliably judging the importance of the input features difficult. We address this
    by changing the test-time behavior of neural networks using Deep k-Nearest Neighbors.
    Without harming text classification accuracy, this algorithm provides a more robust
    uncertainty metric which we use to generate feature importance values. The resulting
    interpretations better align with human perception than baseline methods. Finally,
    we use our interpretation method to analyze model predictions on dataset annotation
    artifacts.

  abstract: Character language models have access to surface morphological patterns,
    but it is not clear whether or how they learn abstract morphological regularities.
    We instrument a character language model with several probes, finding that it
    can develop a specific unit to identify word boundaries and, by extension, morpheme
    boundaries, which allows it to capture linguistic properties and regularities
    of these units. Our language model proves surprisingly good at identifying the
    selectional restrictions of English derivational morphemes, a task that requires
    both morphological and syntactic awareness. Thus we conclude that, when morphemes
    overlap extensively with the words of a language, a character language model can
    perform morphological abstraction.

    \ in nature that have shown promising results in various natural language processing\
    \ tasks. Despite their success, it still remains a challenge to understand their\
    \ hidden behavior. In this work, we analyze and interpret the cumulative nature\
    \ of RNN via a proposed technique named as Layer-wIse-Semantic-Accumulation (LISA)\
    \ for explaining decisions and detecting the most likely (i.e., saliency) patterns\
    \ that the network relies on while decision making. We demonstrate (1) LISA: \u201C\
    How an RNN accumulates or builds semantics during its sequential processing for\
    \ a given text example and expected response\u201D (2) Example2pattern: \u201C\
    How the saliency patterns look like for each category in the data according to\
    \ the network in decision making\u201D. We analyse the sensitiveness of RNNs about\
    \ different inputs to check the increase or decrease in prediction scores and\
    \ further extract the saliency patterns learned by the network. We employ two\
    \ relation classification datasets: SemEval 10 Task 8 and TAC KBP Slot Filling\
    \ to explain RNN predictions via the LISA and example2pattern."

  abstract: We investigate how encoder-decoder models trained on a synthetic dataset
    of task-oriented dialogues process disfluencies, such as hesitations and self-corrections.
    We find that, contrary to earlier results, disfluencies have very little impact
    on the task success of seq-to-seq models with attention. Using visualisations
    and diagnostic classifiers, we analyse the representations that are incrementally
    built by the model, and discover that models develop little to no awareness of
    the structure of disfluencies. However, adding disfluencies to the data appears
    to help the model create clearer representations overall, as evidenced by the
    attention patterns the different models exhibit.

  abstract: We propose to achieve explainable neural machine translation (NMT) by
    changing the output representation to explain itself. We present a novel approach
    to NMT which generates the target sentence by monotonically walking through the
    source sentence. Word reordering is modeled by operations which allow setting
    markers in the target sentence and move a target-side write head between those
    markers. In contrast to many modern neural models, our system emits explicit word
    alignment information which is often crucial to practical machine translation
    as it improves explainability. Our technique can outperform a plain text system
    in terms of BLEU score under the recent Transformer architecture on Japanese-English
    and Portuguese-English, and is within 0.5 BLEU difference on Spanish-English.

  abstract: 'Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have experienced great success in the
    past few years. The increasing complexity of these models leads to less understanding
    about their decision processes. Therefore, introspection techniques have been
    proposed, mostly for images as input data. Patterns or relevant regions in images
    can be intuitively interpreted by a human observer. This is not the case for more
    complex data like speech recordings. In this work, we investigate the application
    of common introspection techniques from computer vision to an Automatic Speech
    Recognition (ASR) task. To this end, we use a model similar to image classification,
    which predicts letters from spectrograms. We show difficulties in applying image
    introspection to ASR. To tackle these problems, we propose normalized averaging
    of aligned inputs (NAvAI): a data-driven method to reveal learned patterns for
    prediction of specific classes. Our method integrates information from many data
    examples through local introspection techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNNs). We demonstrate that our method provides better interpretability of letter-specific
    patterns than existing methods.'

  abstract: 'Previous research on word embeddings has shown that sparse representations,
    which can be either learned on top of existing dense embeddings or obtained through
    model constraints during training time, have the benefit of increased interpretability
    properties: to some degree, each dimension can be understood by a human and associated
    with a recognizable feature in the data. In this paper, we transfer this idea
    to sentence embeddings and explore several approaches to obtain a sparse representation.
    We further introduce a novel, quantitative and automated evaluation metric for
    sentence embedding interpretability, based on topic coherence methods. We observe
    an increase in interpretability compared to dense models, on a dataset of movie
    dialogs and on the scene descriptions from the MS COCO dataset.'

    \ designed to expose filler\u2013gap dependencies, we show that RNNs can represent\

    \ Furthermore, we show that RNNs learn a subset of the known restrictions on filler\u2013\
    gap dependencies, known as island constraints: RNNs show evidence for wh-islands,\
    \ adjunct islands, and complex NP islands. These studies demonstrates that state-of-the-art\
    \ RNN models are able to learn and generalize about empty syntactic positions."

  abstract: 'In this paper, we attempt to link the inner workings of a neural language
    model to linguistic theory, focusing on a complex phenomenon well discussed in
    formal linguistics: (negative) polarity items. We briefly discuss the leading
    hypotheses about the licensing contexts that allow negative polarity items and
    evaluate to what extent a neural language model has the ability to correctly process
    a subset of such constructions. We show that the model finds a relation between
    the licensing context and the negative polarity item and appears to be aware of
    the scope of this context, which we extract from a parse tree of the sentence.
    With this research, we hope to pave the way for other studies linking formal linguistics
    to deep learning.'

  abstract: Many natural and formal languages contain words or symbols that require
    a matching counterpart for making an expression well-formed. The combination of
    opening and closing brackets is a typical example of such a construction. Due
    to their commonness, the ability to follow such rules is important for language
    modeling. Currently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are extensively used for
    this task. We investigate whether they are capable of learning the rules of opening
    and closing brackets by applying them to synthetic Dyck languages that consist
    of different types of brackets. We provide an analysis of the statistical properties
    of these languages as a baseline and show strengths and limits of Elman-RNNs,
    GRUs and LSTMs in experiments on random samples of these languages. In terms of
    perplexity and prediction accuracy, the RNNs get close to the theoretical baseline
    in most cases.

  abstract: "How do neural language models keep track of number agreement between\
    \ subject and verb? We show that \u2018diagnostic classifiers\u2019, trained to\
    \ predict number from the internal states of a language model, provide a detailed\
    \ understanding of how, when, and where this information is represented. Moreover,\
    \ they give us insight into when and where number information is corrupted in\
    \ cases where the language model ends up making agreement errors. To demonstrate\
    \ the causal role played by the representations we find, we then use agreement\
    \ information to influence the course of the LSTM during the processing of difficult\
    \ sentences. Results from such an intervention reveal a large increase in the\
    \ language model\u2019s accuracy. Together, these results show that diagnostic\
    \ classifiers give us an unrivalled detailed look into the representation of linguistic\
    \ information in neural models, and demonstrate that this knowledge can be used\
    \ to improve their performance."

  abstract: Natural language processing has greatly benefited from the introduction
    of the attention mechanism. However, standard attention models are of limited
    interpretability for tasks that involve a series of inference steps. We describe
    an iterative recursive attention model, which constructs incremental representations
    of input data through reusing results of previously computed queries. We train
    our model on sentiment classification datasets and demonstrate its capacity to
    identify and combine different aspects of the input in an easily interpretable
    manner, while obtaining performance close to the state of the art.

  abstract: While Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and other forms of recurrent
    neural network have been successfully applied to language modeling on a character
    level, the hidden state dynamics of these models can be difficult to interpret.
    We investigate the hidden states of such a model by using the HDBSCAN clustering
    algorithm to identify points in the text at which the hidden state is similar.
    Focusing on whitespace characters prior to the beginning of a word reveals interpretable
    clusters that offer insight into how the LSTM may combine contextual and character-level
    information to identify parts of speech. We also introduce a method for deriving
    word vectors from the hidden state representation in order to investigate the
    word-level knowledge of the model. These word vectors encode meaningful semantic
    information even for words that appear only once in the training text.

  abstract: Despite their superior performance, deep learning models often lack interpretability.
    In this paper, we explore the modeling of insightful relations between words,
    in order to understand and enhance predictions. To this effect, we propose the
    Self-Attention Network (SANet), a flexible and interpretable architecture for
    text classification. Experiments indicate that gains obtained by self-attention
    is task-dependent. For instance, experiments on sentiment analysis tasks showed
    an improvement of around 2% when using self-attention compared to a baseline without
    attention, while topic classification showed no gain. Interpretability brought
    forward by our architecture highlighted the importance of neighboring word interactions
    to extract sentiment.

  abstract: This paper presents an approach for investigating the nature of semantic
    information captured by word embeddings. We propose a method that extends an existing
    human-elicited semantic property dataset with gold negative examples using crowd
    judgments. Our experimental approach tests the ability of supervised classifiers
    to identify semantic features in word embedding vectors and compares this to a
    feature-identification method based on full vector cosine similarity. The idea
    behind this method is that properties identified by classifiers, but not through
    full vector comparison are captured by embeddings. Properties that cannot be identified
    by either method are not. Our results provide an initial indication that semantic
    properties relevant for the way entities interact (e.g. dangerous) are captured,
    while perceptual information (e.g. colors) is not represented. We conclude that,
    though preliminary, these results show that our method is suitable for identifying
    which properties are captured by embeddings.

  abstract: The attention mechanism is a successful technique in modern NLP, especially
    in tasks like machine translation. The recently proposed network architecture
    of the Transformer is based entirely on attention mechanisms and achieves new
    state of the art results in neural machine translation, outperforming other sequence-to-sequence
    models. However, so far not much is known about the internal properties of the
    model and the representations it learns to achieve that performance. To study
    this question, we investigate the information that is learned by the attention
    mechanism in Transformer models with different translation quality. We assess
    the representations of the encoder by extracting dependency relations based on
    self-attention weights, we perform four probing tasks to study the amount of syntactic
    and semantic captured information and we also test attention in a transfer learning
    scenario. Our analysis sheds light on the relative strengths and weaknesses of
    the various encoder representations. We observe that specific attention heads
    mark syntactic dependency relations and we can also confirm that lower layers
    tend to learn more about syntax while higher layers tend to encode more semantics.

  abstract: Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models are often employed in settings where
    the target output is natural language. However, the syntactic properties of the
    language generated from these models are not well understood. We explore whether
    such output belongs to a formal and realistic grammar, by employing the English
    Resource Grammar (ERG), a broad coverage, linguistically precise HPSG-based grammar
    of English. From a French to English parallel corpus, we analyze the parseability
    and grammatical constructions occurring in output from a seq2seq translation model.
    Over 93% of the model translations are parseable, suggesting that it learns to
    generate conforming to a grammar. The model has trouble learning the distribution
    of rarer syntactic rules, and we pinpoint several constructions that differentiate
    translations between the references and our model.

  abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of stack-augmented recurrent neural network
    (RNN) models. Due to the architectural similarity between stack RNNs and pushdown
    transducers, we train stack RNN models on a number of tasks, including string
    reversal, context-free language modelling, and cumulative XOR evaluation. Examining
    the behavior of our networks, we show that stack-augmented RNNs can discover intuitive
    stack-based strategies for solving our tasks. However, stack RNNs are more difficult
    to train than classical architectures such as LSTMs. Rather than employ stack-based
    strategies, more complex networks often find approximate solutions by using the
    stack as unstructured memory.

  abstract: "Datasets that boosted state-of-the-art solutions for Question Answering\
    \ (QA) systems prove that it is possible to ask questions in natural language\
    \ manner. However, users are still used to query-like systems where they type\
    \ in keywords to search for answer. In this study we validate which parts of questions\
    \ are essential for obtaining valid answer. In order to conclude that, we take\
    \ advantage of LIME - a framework that explains prediction by local approximation.\
    \ We find that grammar and natural language is disregarded by QA. State-of-the-art\
    \ model can answer properly even if \u2019asked\u2019 only with a few words with\
    \ high coefficients calculated with LIME. According to our knowledge, it is the\
    \ first time that QA model is being explained by LIME."

  abstract: In this paper we present the results of an investigation of the importance
    of verbs in a deep learning QA system trained on SQuAD dataset. We show that main
    verbs in questions carry little influence on the decisions made by the system
    - in over 90% of researched cases swapping verbs for their antonyms did not change
    system decision. We track this phenomenon down to the insides of the net, analyzing
    the mechanism of self-attention and values contained in hidden layers of RNN.
    Finally, we recognize the characteristics of the SQuAD dataset as the source of
    the problem. Our work refers to the recently popular topic of adversarial examples
    in NLP, combined with investigating deep net structure.

  abstract: Input optimization methods, such as Google Deep Dream, create interpretable
    representations of neurons for computer vision DNNs. We propose and evaluate ways
    of transferring this technology to NLP. Our results suggest that gradient ascent
    with a gumbel softmax layer produces n-gram representations that outperform naive
    corpus search in terms of target neuron activation. The representations highlight
    differences in syntax awareness between the language and visual models of the
    Imaginet architecture.

  abstract: A glut of recent research shows that language models capture linguistic
    structure. Such work answers the question of whether a model represents linguistic
    structure. But how and when are these structures acquired? Rather than treating
    the training process itself as a black box, we investigate how representations
    of linguistic structure are learned over time. In particular, we demonstrate that
    different aspects of linguistic structure are learned at different rates, with
    part of speech tagging acquired early and global topic information learned continuously.

  abstract: "We propose a novel way to handle out of vocabulary (OOV) words in downstream\
    \ natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We implement a network that predicts\
    \ useful embeddings for OOV words based on their morphology and on the context\
    \ in which they appear. Our model also incorporates an attention mechanism indicating\
    \ the focus allocated to the left context words, the right context words or the\
    \ word\u2019s characters, hence making the prediction more interpretable. The\
    \ model is a \u201Cdrop-in\u201D module that is jointly trained with the downstream\
    \ task\u2019s neural network, thus producing embeddings specialized for the task\
    \ at hand. When the task is mostly syntactical, we observe that our model aims\
    \ most of its attention on surface form characters. On the other hand, for tasks\
    \ more semantical, the network allocates more attention to the surrounding words.\
    \ In all our tests, the module helps the network to achieve better performances\
    \ in comparison to the use of simple random embeddings."

  abstract: "Learning universal sentence representations which accurately model sentential\
    \ semantic content is a current goal of natural language processing research.\
    \ A prominent and successful approach is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs)\
    \ to encode sentences into fixed length vectors. Many core linguistic phenomena\
    \ that one would like to model in universal sentence representations depend on\
    \ syntactic structure. Despite the fact that RNNs do not have explicit syntactic\
    \ structural representations, there is some evidence that RNNs can approximate\
    \ such structure-dependent phenomena under certain conditions, in addition to\
    \ their widespread success in practical tasks. In this work, we assess RNNs\u2019\
    \ ability to learn the structure-dependent phenomenon of main clause tense."

  abstract: We present a large scale collection of diverse natural language inference
    (NLI) datasets that help provide insight into how well a sentence representation
    encoded by a neural network captures distinct types of reasoning. The collection
    results from recasting 13 existing datasets from 7 semantic phenomena into a common
    NLI structure, resulting in over half a million labeled context-hypothesis pairs
    in total. Our collection of diverse datasets is available at http://www.decomp.net/,
    and will grow over time as additional resources are recast and added from novel
    sources.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of calibrating a word embedding, so
    that the semantic it conveys becomes more relevant to the context. Our method
    is novel because the output shows clearly which senses that were originally presented
    in a target word embedding become stronger or weaker. This is possible by utilizing
    the technique of using sparse coding to recover senses that comprises a word embedding.

  abstract: We present a framework for analyzing what the state in RNNs remembers
    from its input embeddings. We compute the gradients of the states with respect
    to the input embeddings and decompose the gradient matrix with Singular Value
    Decomposition to analyze which directions in the embedding space are best transferred
    to the hidden state space, characterized by the largest singular values. We apply
    our approach to LSTM language models and investigate to what extent and for how
    long certain classes of words are remembered on average for a certain corpus.
    Additionally, the extent to which a specific property or relationship is remembered
    by the RNN can be tracked by comparing a vector characterizing that property with
    the direction(s) in embedding space that are best preserved in hidden state space.

  abstract: There is a long-standing interest in understanding the internal behavior
    of neural networks. Deep neural architectures for natural language processing
    (NLP) are often accompanied by explanations for their effectiveness, from general
    observations (e.g. RNNs can represent unbounded dependencies in a sequence) to
    specific arguments about linguistic phenomena (early layers encode lexical information,
    deeper layers syntactic). The recent ascendancy of DNNs is fueling efforts in
    the NLP community to explore these claims. Previous work has tended to focus on
    easily-accessible representations like word or sentence embeddings, with deeper
    structure requiring more ad hoc methods to extract and examine. In this work,
    we introduce Vivisect, a toolkit that aims at a general solution for broad and
    fine-grained monitoring in the major DNN frameworks, with minimal change to research
    patterns.

  abstract: 'Human ability to understand language is general, flexible, and robust.
    In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific
    task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with
    understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs
    and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a
    range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in
    this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE,
    gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset
    for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an
    online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks,
    training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the
    genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge
    in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer
    across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for
    the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to
    ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo
    (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art
    sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute
    scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance
    over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.'

  abstract: "Recently, researchers have found that deep LSTMs trained on tasks like\
    \ machine translation learn substantial syntactic and semantic information about\
    \ their input sentences, including part-of-speech. These findings begin to shed\
    \ light on why pretrained representations, like ELMo and CoVe, are so beneficial\

    \ a clear understanding of how the choice of pretraining objective affects the\
    \ type of linguistic information that models learn. With this in mind, we compare\
    \ four objectives\u2014language modeling, translation, skip-thought, and autoencoding\u2014\
    on their ability to induce syntactic and part-of-speech information, holding constant\
    \ the quantity and genre of the training data, as well as the LSTM architecture."

  abstract: Performance in language modelling has been significantly improved by training
    recurrent neural networks on large corpora. This progress has come at the cost
    of interpretability and an understanding of how these architectures function,
    making principled development of better language models more difficult. We look
    inside a state-of-the-art neural language model to analyse how this model represents
    high-level lexico-semantic information. In particular, we investigate how the
    model represents words by extracting activation patterns where they occur in the
    text, and compare these representations directly to human semantic knowledge.

  abstract: 'Neural network methods are experiencing wide adoption in NLP, thanks
    to their empirical performance on many tasks. Modern neural architectures go way
    beyond simple feedforward and recurrent models: they are complex pipelines that
    perform soft, differentiable computation instead of discrete logic. The price
    of such soft computing is the introduction of dense dependencies, which make it
    hard to disentangle the patterns that trigger a prediction. Our recent work on
    sparse and structured latent computation presents a promising avenue for enhancing
    interpretability of such neural pipelines. Through this extended abstract, we
    aim to discuss and explore the potential and impact of our methods.'

  abstract: "Neural attention-based sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) (Sutskever\
    \ et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) have proven to be accurate and robust for\
    \ many sequence prediction tasks. They have become the standard approach for automatic\
    \ translation of text, at the cost of increased model complexity and uncertainty.\
    \ End-to-end trained neural models act as a black box, which makes it difficult\
    \ to examine model decisions and attribute errors to a specific part of a model.\
    \ The highly connected and high-dimensional internal representations pose a challenge\
    \ for analysis and visualization tools. The development of methods to understand\
    \ seq2seq predictions is crucial for systems in production settings, as mistakes\
    \ involving language are often very apparent to human readers. For instance, a\
    \ widely publicized incident resulted from a translation system mistakenly translating\
    \ \u201Cgood morning\u201D into \u201Cattack them\u201D leading to a wrongful\
    \ arrest (Hern, 2017)."

  abstract: Grammar induction is the task of learning syntactic structure without
    the expert-labeled treebanks (Charniak and Carroll, 1992; Klein and Manning, 2002).
    Recent work on latent tree learning offers a new family of approaches to this
    problem by inducing syntactic structure using the supervision from a downstream
    NLP task (Yogatama et al., 2017; Maillard et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2018). In
    a recent paper published at ICLR, Shen et al. (2018) introduce such a model and
    report near state-of-the-art results on the target task of language modeling,
    and the first strong latent tree learning result on constituency parsing. During
    the analysis of this model, we discover issues that make the original results
    hard to trust, including tuning and even training on what is effectively the test
    set. Here, we analyze the model under different configurations to understand what
    it learns and to identify the conditions under which it succeeds. We find that
    this model represents the first empirical success for neural network latent tree
    learning, and that neural language modeling warrants further study as a setting
    for grammar induction.

  abstract: The decision making processes of deep networks are difficult to understand
    and while their accuracy often improves with increased architectural complexity,
    so too does their opacity. Practical use of machine learning models, especially
    for question and answering applications, demands a system that is interpretable.
    We analyze the attention of a memory network model to reconcile contradictory
    performance on a challenging question-answering dataset that is inspired by theory-of-mind
    experiments. We equate success on questions to task classification, which explains
    not only test-time failures but also how well the model generalizes to new training
    conditions.

  abstract: "We hypothesize that end-to-end neural image captioning systems work seemingly\
    \ well because they exploit and learn \u2018distributional similarity\u2019 in\
    \ a multimodal feature space, by mapping a test image to similar training images\
    \ in this space and generating a caption from the same space. To validate our\
    \ hypothesis, we focus on the \u2018image\u2019 side of image captioning, and\
    \ vary the input image representation but keep the RNN text generation model of\
    \ a CNN-RNN constant. Our analysis indicates that image captioning models (i)\
    \ are capable of separating structure from noisy input representations; (ii) experience\
    \ virtually no significant performance loss when a high dimensional representation\
    \ is compressed to a lower dimensional space; (iii) cluster images with similar\
    \ visual and linguistic information together. Our experiments all point to one\
    \ fact: that our distributional similarity hypothesis holds. We conclude that,\
    \ regardless of the image representation, image captioning systems seem to match\
    \ images and generate captions in a learned joint image-text semantic subspace."

  abstract: In this submission I report work in progress on learning simplified interpreted
    languages by means of recurrent models. The data is constructed to reflect core
    properties of natural language as modeled in formal syntax and semantics. Preliminary
    results suggest that LSTM networks do generalise to compositional interpretation,
    albeit only in the most favorable learning setting.

  abstract: We present the results of the first Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER)
    Shared Task. The task challenged participants to classify whether human-written
    factoid claims could be SUPPORTED or REFUTED using evidence retrieved from Wikipedia.
    We received entries from 23 competing teams, 19 of which scored higher than the
    previously published baseline. The best performing system achieved a FEVER score
    of 64.21%. In this paper, we present the results of the shared task and a summary
    of the systems, highlighting commonalities and innovations among participating
    systems.

  abstract: "Misinformation detection at the level of full news articles is a text\
    \ classification problem. Reliably labeled data in this domain is rare. Previous\
    \ work relied on news articles collected from so-called \u201Creputable\u201D\
    \ and \u201Csuspicious\u201D websites and labeled accordingly. We leverage fact-checking\
    \ websites to collect individually-labeled news articles with regard to the veracity\
    \ of their content and use this data to test the cross-domain generalization of\
    \ a classifier trained on bigger text collections but labeled according to source\
    \ reputation. Our results suggest that reputation-based classification is not\
    \ sufficient for predicting the veracity level of the majority of news articles,\
    \ and that the system performance on different test datasets depends on topic\
    \ distribution. Therefore collecting well-balanced and carefully-assessed training\
    \ data is a priority for developing robust misinformation detection systems."

  abstract: Distant supervision is a popular method for performing relation extraction
    from text that is known to produce noisy labels. Most progress in relation extraction
    and classification has been made with crowdsourced corrections to distant-supervised
    labels, and there is evidence that indicates still more would be better. In this
    paper, we explore the problem of propagating human annotation signals gathered
    for open-domain relation classification through the CrowdTruth methodology for
    crowdsourcing, that captures ambiguity in annotations by measuring inter-annotator
    disagreement. Our approach propagates annotations to sentences that are similar
    in a low dimensional embedding space, expanding the number of labels by two orders
    of magnitude. Our experiments show significant improvement in a sentence-level
    multi-class relation classifier.

  abstract: 'SimpleQuestions is a commonly used benchmark for single-factoid question
    answering (QA) over Knowledge Graphs (KG). Existing QA systems rely on various
    components to solve different sub-tasks of the problem (such as entity detection,
    entity linking, relation prediction and evidence integration). In this work, we
    propose a different approach to the problem and present an information retrieval
    style solution for it. We adopt a two-phase approach: candidate generation and
    candidate re-ranking to answer questions. We propose a Triplet-Siamese-Hybrid
    CNN (TSHCNN) to re-rank candidate answers. Our approach achieves an accuracy of
    80% which sets a new state-of-the-art on the SimpleQuestions dataset.'

  abstract: In this paper we present a browser plugin NewsScan that assists online
    news readers in evaluating the quality of online content they read by providing
    information nutrition labels for online news articles. In analogy to groceries,
    where nutrition labels help consumers make choices that they consider best for
    themselves, information nutrition labels tag online news articles with data that
    help readers judge the articles they engage with. This paper discusses the choice
    of the labels, their implementation and visualization.

  abstract: Information extraction about an event can be improved by incorporating
    external evidence. In this study, we propose a joint model for pseudo-relevance
    feedback based query expansion and information extraction with reinforcement learning.
    Our model generates an event-specific query to effectively retrieve documents
    relevant to the event. We demonstrate that our model is comparable or has better
    performance than the previous model in two publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
    we analyzed the influences of the retrieval effectiveness in our model on the
    extraction performance.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose to adapt the four-staged pipeline proposed by
    Zubiaga et al. (2018) for the Rumor Verification task to the problem of Fake News
    Detection. We show that the recently released FNC-1 corpus covers two of its steps,
    namely the Tracking and the Stance Detection task. We identify asymmetry in length
    in the input to be a key characteristic of the latter step, when adapted to the
    framework of Fake News Detection, and propose to handle it as a specific type
    of Cross-Level Stance Detection. Inspired by theories from the field of Journalism
    Studies, we implement and test two architectures to successfully model the internal
    structure of an article and its interactions with a claim.

  abstract: With the growth of the internet, the number of fake-news online has been
    proliferating every year. The consequences of such phenomena are manifold, ranging
    from lousy decision-making process to bullying and violence episodes. Therefore,
    fact-checking algorithms became a valuable asset. To this aim, an important step
    to detect fake-news is to have access to a credibility score for a given information
    source. However, most of the widely used Web indicators have either been shutdown
    to the public (e.g., Google PageRank) or are not free for use (Alexa Rank). Further
    existing databases are short-manually curated lists of online sources, which do
    not scale. Finally, most of the research on the topic is theoretical-based or
    explore confidential data in a restricted simulation environment. In this paper
    we explore current research, highlight the challenges and propose solutions to
    tackle the problem of classifying websites into a credibility scale. The proposed
    model automatically extracts source reputation cues and computes a credibility
    factor, providing valuable insights which can help in belittling dubious and confirming
    trustful unknown websites. Experimental results outperform state of the art in
    the 2-classes and 5-classes setting.

  abstract: We present an automated approach to distinguish true, false, stretch,
    and dodge statements in questions and answers in the Canadian Parliament. We leverage
    the truthfulness annotations of a U.S. fact-checking corpus by training a neural
    net model and incorporating the prediction probabilities into our models. We find
    that in concert with other linguistic features, these probabilities can improve
    the multi-class classification results. We further show that dodge statements
    can be detected with an F1 measure as high as 82.57% in binary classification
    settings.

  abstract: With the uncontrolled increasing of fake news and rumors over the Web,
    different approaches have been proposed to address the problem. In this paper,
    we present an approach that combines lexical, word embeddings and n-gram features
    to detect the stance in fake news. Our approach has been tested on the Fake News
    Challenge (FNC-1) dataset. Given a news title-article pair, the FNC-1 task aims
    at determining the relevance of the article and the title. Our proposed approach
    has achieved an accurate result (59.6 % Macro F1) that is close to the state-of-the-art
    result with 0.013 difference using a simple feature representation. Furthermore,
    we have investigated the importance of different lexicons in the detection of
    the classification labels.

  abstract: We consider the task of relation classification, and pose this task as
    one of textual entailment. We show that this formulation leads to several advantages,
    including the ability to (i) perform zero-shot relation classification by exploiting
    relation descriptions, (ii) utilize existing textual entailment models, and (iii)
    leverage readily available textual entailment datasets, to enhance the performance
    of relation classification systems. Our experiments show that the proposed approach
    achieves 20.16% and 61.32% in F1 zero-shot classification performance on two datasets,
    which further improved to 22.80% and 64.78% respectively with the use of conditional
    encoding.

  abstract: Existing entailment datasets mainly pose problems which can be answered
    without attention to grammar or word order. Learning syntax requires comparing
    examples where different grammar and word order change the desired classification.
    We introduce several datasets based on synthetic transformations of natural entailment
    examples in SNLI or FEVER, to teach aspects of grammar and word order. We show
    that without retraining, popular entailment models are unaware that these syntactic
    differences change meaning. With retraining, some but not all popular entailment
    models can learn to compare the syntax properly.

  abstract: Fact-checking is a journalistic practice that compares a claim made publicly
    against trusted sources of facts. Wang (2017) introduced a large dataset of validated
    claims from the POLITIFACT.com website (LIAR dataset), enabling the development
    of machine learning approaches for fact-checking. However, approaches based on
    this dataset have focused primarily on modeling the claim and speaker-related
    metadata, without considering the evidence used by humans in labeling the claims.
    We extend the LIAR dataset by automatically extracting the justification from
    the fact-checking article used by humans to label a given claim. We show that
    modeling the extracted justification in conjunction with the claim (and metadata)
    provides a significant improvement regardless of the machine learning model used
    (feature-based or deep learning) both in a binary classification task (true, false)
    and in a six-way classification task (pants on fire, false, mostly false, half
    true, mostly true, true).

  abstract: "Common-sense reasoning is becoming increasingly important for the advancement\
    \ of Natural Language Processing. While word embeddings have been very successful,\
    \ they cannot explain which aspects of \u2018coffee\u2019 and \u2018tea\u2019\
    \ make them similar, or how they could be related to \u2018shop\u2019. In this\
    \ paper, we propose an explicit word representation that builds upon the Distributional\
    \ Hypothesis to represent meaning from semantic roles, and allow inference of\
    \ relations from their meshing, as supported by the affordance-based Indexical\
    \ Hypothesis. We find that our model improves the state-of-the-art on unsupervised\

  abstract: In this paper we describe our 2nd place FEVER shared-task system that
    achieved a FEVER score of 62.52% on the provisional test set (without additional
    human evaluation), and 65.41% on the development set. Our system is a four stage
    model consisting of document retrieval, sentence retrieval, natural language inference
    and aggregation. Retrieval is performed leveraging task-specific features, and
    then a natural language inference model takes each of the retrieved sentences
    paired with the claimed fact. The resulting predictions are aggregated across
    retrieved sentences with a Multi-Layer Perceptron, and re-ranked corresponding
    to the final prediction.

  abstract: The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) shared task was launched
    to support the development of systems able to verify claims by extracting supporting
    or refuting facts from raw text. The shared task organizers provide a large-scale
    dataset for the consecutive steps involved in claim verification, in particular,
    document retrieval, fact extraction, and claim classification. In this paper,
    we present our claim verification pipeline approach, which, according to the preliminary
    results, scored third in the shared task, out of 23 competing systems. For the
    document retrieval, we implemented a new entity linking approach. In order to
    be able to rank candidate facts and classify a claim on the basis of several selected
    facts, we introduce two extensions to the Enhanced LSTM (ESIM).

  abstract: We develop a system for the FEVER fact extraction and verification challenge
    that uses a high precision entailment classifier based on transformer networks
    pretrained with language modeling, to classify a broad set of potential evidence.
    The precision of the entailment classifier allows us to enhance recall by considering
    every statement from several articles to decide upon each claim. We include not
    only the articles best matching the claim text by TFIDF score, but read additional
    articles whose titles match named entities and capitalized expressions occurring
    in the claim text. The entailment module evaluates potential evidence one statement
    at a time, together with the title of the page the evidence came from (providing
    a hint about possible pronoun antecedents). In preliminary evaluation, the system
    achieves .5736 FEVER score, .6108 label accuracy, and .6485 evidence F1 on the
    FEVER shared task test set.

  abstract: In this paper we present our system for the FEVER Challenge. The task
    of this challenge is to verify claims by extracting information from Wikipedia.
    Our system has two parts. In the first part it performs a search for candidate
    sentences by treating the claims as query. In the second part it filters out noise
    from these candidates and uses the remaining ones to decide whether they support
    or refute or entail not enough information to verify the claim. We show that this
    system achieves a FEVER score of 0.3927 on the FEVER shared task development data
    set which is a 25.5% improvement over the baseline score.

    \ Cosine similarity with unigram Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)\
    \ to rank sentences by their similarity to the claim. 3) Textual Entailment: We\

  abstract: We describe here our system and results on the FEVER shared task. We prepared
    a pipeline system which composes of a document selection, a sentence retrieval,
    and a recognizing textual entailment (RTE) components. A simple entity linking
    approach with text match is used as the document selection component, this component
    identifies relevant documents for a given claim by using mentioned entities as
    clues. The sentence retrieval component selects relevant sentences as candidate
    evidence from the documents based on TF-IDF. Finally, the RTE component selects
    evidence sentences by ranking the sentences and classifies the claim simultaneously.
    The experimental results show that our system achieved the FEVER score of 0.4016
    and outperformed the official baseline system.

  abstract: This paper presents the ColumbiaNLP submission for the FEVER Workshop
    Shared Task. Our system is an end-to-end pipeline that extracts factual evidence
    from Wikipedia and infers a decision about the truthfulness of the claim based
    on the extracted evidence. Our pipeline achieves significant improvement over
    the baseline for all the components (Document Retrieval, Sentence Selection and
    Textual Entailment) both on the development set and the test set. Our team finished
    6th out of 24 teams on the leader-board based on the preliminary results with
    a FEVER score of 49.06 on the blind test set compared to 27.45 of the baseline
    system.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe DeFactoNLP, the system we designed for the
    FEVER 2018 Shared Task. The aim of this task was to conceive a system that can
    not only automatically assess the veracity of a claim but also retrieve evidence
    supporting this assessment from Wikipedia. In our approach, the Wikipedia documents
    whose Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) vectors are most similar
    to the vector of the claim and those documents whose names are similar to those
    of the named entities (NEs) mentioned in the claim are identified as the documents
    which might contain evidence. The sentences in these documents are then supplied
    to a textual entailment recognition module. This module calculates the probability
    of each sentence supporting the claim, contradicting the claim or not providing
    any relevant information to assess the veracity of the claim. Various features
    computed using these probabilities are finally used by a Random Forest classifier
    to determine the overall truthfulness of the claim. The sentences which support
    this classification are returned as evidence. Our approach achieved a 0.4277 evidence
    F1-score, a 0.5136 label accuracy and a 0.3833 FEVER score.

  abstract: "With huge amount of information generated every day on the web, fact\
    \ checking is an important and challenging task which can help people identify\
    \ the authenticity of most claims as well as providing evidences selected from\
    \ knowledge source like Wikipedia. Here we decompose this problem into two parts:\
    \ an entity linking task (retrieving relative Wikipedia pages) and recognizing\
    \ textual entailment between the claim and selected pages. In this paper, we present\
    \ an end-to-end multi-task learning with bi-direction attention (EMBA) model to\
    \ classify the claim as \u201Csupports\u201D, \u201Crefutes\u201D or \u201Cnot\
    \ enough info\u201D with respect to the pages retrieved and detect sentences as\
    \ evidence at the same time. We conduct experiments on the FEVER (Fact Extraction\
    \ and VERification) paper test dataset and shared task test dataset, a new public\
    \ dataset for verification against textual sources. Experimental results show\
    \ that our method achieves comparable performance compared with the baseline system."

  abstract: In this system description of our pipeline to participate at the Fever
    Shared Task, we describe our sentence-based approach. Throughout all steps of
    our pipeline, we regarded single sentences as our processing unit. In our IR-Component,
    we searched in the set of all possible Wikipedia introduction sentences without
    limiting sentences to a fixed number of relevant documents. In the entailment
    module, we judged every sentence separately and combined the result of the classifier
    for the top 5 sentences with the help of an ensemble classifier to make a judgment
    whether the truth of a statement can be derived from the given claim.

  abstract: Many tasks such as question answering and reading comprehension rely on
    information extracted from unreliable sources. These systems would thus benefit
    from knowing whether a statement from an unreliable source is correct. We present
    experiments on the FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) task, a shared task
    that involves selecting sentences from Wikipedia and predicting whether a claim
    is supported by those sentences, refuted, or there is not enough information.
    Fact checking is a task that benefits from not only asserting or disputing the
    veracity of a claim but also finding evidence for that position. As these tasks
    are dependent on each other, an ideal model would consider the veracity of the
    claim when finding evidence and also find only the evidence that is relevant.
    We thus jointly model sentence extraction and verification on the FEVER shared
    task. Among all participants, we ranked 5th on the blind test set (prior to any
    additional human evaluation of the evidence).

  abstract: "Many approaches to automatically recognizing entailment relations have\
    \ employed classifiers over hand engineered lexicalized features, or deep learning\
    \ models that implicitly capture lexicalization through word embeddings. This\
    \ reliance on lexicalization may complicate the adaptation of these tools between\
    \ domains. For example, such a system trained in the news domain may learn that\
    \ a sentence like \u201CPalestinians recognize Texas as part of Mexico\u201D tends\
    \ to be unsupported, but this fact (and its corresponding lexicalized cues) have\
    \ no value in, say, a scientific domain. To mitigate this dependence on lexicalized\
    \ information, in this paper we propose a model that reads two sentences, from\
    \ any given domain, to determine entailment without using lexicalized features.\
    \ Instead our model relies on features that are either unlexicalized or are domain\
    \ independent such as proportion of negated verbs, antonyms, or noun overlap.\
    \ In its current implementation, this model does not perform well on the FEVER\
    \ dataset, due to two reasons. First, for the information retrieval portion of\
    \ the task we used the baseline system provided, since this was not the aim of\
    \ our project. Second, this is work in progress and we still are in the process\
    \ of identifying more features and gradually increasing the accuracy of our model.\
    \ In the end, we hope to build a generic end-to-end classifier, which can be used\
    \ in a domain outside the one in which it was trained, with no or minimal re-training."

    \ following previous observations that language use differs by gender, it captures\
    \ and uses gender information through domain adaptation; it captures recency of\
    \ posts under the hypothesis that more recent posts are more representative of\

    \ in this scenario where activity factors are sparsely represented in the data,\
    \ a bag-of-word neural network model using custom dictionaries of food and activity\
    \ words performs better than other neural sequence models. Our best model, which\

  abstract: With Health 2.0, patients and caregivers increasingly seek information
    regarding possible drug side effects during their medical treatments in online
    health communities. These are helpful platforms for non-professional medical opinions,
    yet pose risk of being unreliable in quality and insufficient in quantity to cover
    the wide range of potential drug reactions. Existing approaches which analyze
    such user-generated content in online forums heavily rely on feature engineering
    of both documents and users, and often overlook the relationships between posts
    within a common discussion thread. Inspired by recent advancements, we propose
    a neural architecture that models the textual content of user-generated documents
    and user experiences in online communities to predict side effects during treatment.
    Experimental results show that our proposed architecture outperforms baseline
    models.

  abstract: Recently, segment convolutional neural networks have been proposed for
    end-to-end relation extraction in the clinical domain, achieving results comparable
    to or outperforming the approaches with heavy manual feature engineering. In this
    paper, we analyze the errors made by the neural classifier based on confusion
    matrices, and then investigate three simple extensions to overcome its limitations.
    We find that including ontological association between drugs and problems, and
    data-induced association between medical concepts does not reliably improve the
    performance, but that large gains are obtained by the incorporation of semantic
    classes to capture relation triggers.

  abstract: The automation of text summarisation of biomedical publications is a pressing
    need due to the plethora of information available online. This paper explores
    the impact of several supervised machine learning approaches for extracting multi-document
    summaries for given queries. In particular, we compare classification and regression
    approaches for query-based extractive summarisation using data provided by the
    BioASQ Challenge. We tackled the problem of annotating sentences for training
    classification systems and show that a simple annotation approach outperforms
    regression-based summarisation.

  abstract: We compare the use of LSTM-based and CNN-based character-level word embeddings
    in BiLSTM-CRF models to approach chemical and disease named entity recognition
    (NER) tasks. Empirical results over the BioCreative V CDR corpus show that the
    use of either type of character-level word embeddings in conjunction with the
    BiLSTM-CRF models leads to comparable state-of-the-art performance. However, the
    models using CNN-based character-level word embeddings have a computational performance
    advantage, increasing training time over word-based models by 25% while the LSTM-based
    character-level word embeddings more than double the required training time.

  abstract: 'In recent years, we have seen deep learning and distributed representations
    of words and sentences make impact on a number of natural language processing
    tasks, such as similarity, entailment and sentiment analysis. Here we introduce
    a new task: understanding of mental health concepts derived from Cognitive Behavioural
    Therapy (CBT). We define a mental health ontology based on the CBT principles,
    annotate a large corpus where this phenomena is exhibited and perform understanding
    using deep learning and distributed representations. Our results show that the
    performance of deep learning models combined with word embeddings or sentence
    embeddings significantly outperform non-deep-learning models in this difficult
    task. This understanding module will be an essential component of a statistical
    dialogue system delivering therapy.'

  abstract: 'Temporal reasoning remains as an unsolved task for Natural Language Processing
    (NLP), particularly demonstrated in the clinical domain. The complexity of temporal
    representation in language is evident as results of the 2016 Clinical TempEval
    challenge indicate: the current state-of-the-art systems perform well in solving
    mention-identification tasks of event and time expressions but poorly in temporal
    relation extraction, showing a gap of around 0.25 point below human performance.
    We explore to adapt the tree-based LSTM-RNN model proposed by Miwa and Bansal
    (2016) to temporal relation extraction from clinical text, obtaining a five point
    improvement over the best 2016 Clinical TempEval system and two points over the
    state-of-the-art. We deliver a deep analysis of the results and discuss the next
    step towards human-like temporal reasoning.'

  abstract: A new law was established in Japan to promote utilization of EHRs for
    research and developments, while de-identification is required to use EHRs. However,
    studies of automatic de-identification in the healthcare domain is not active
    for Japanese language, no de-identification tool available in practical performance
    for Japanese medical domains, as far as we know. Previous work shows that rule-based
    methods are still effective, while deep learning methods are reported to be better
    recently. In order to implement and evaluate a de-identification tool in a practical
    level, we implemented three methods, rule-based, CRF, and LSTM. We prepared three
    datasets of pseudo EHRs with de-identification tags manually annotated. These
    datasets are derived from shared task data to compare with previous work, and
    our new data to increase training data. Our result shows that our LSTM-based method
    is better and robust, which leads to our future work that plans to apply our system
    to actual de-identification tasks in hospitals.

  abstract: Identifying and extracting data elements such as study descriptors in
    publication full texts is a critical yet manual and labor-intensive step required
    in a number of tasks. In this paper we address the question of identifying data
    elements in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, provided a set of criteria describing
    specific study parameters, such as species, route of administration, and dosing
    regimen, we develop an unsupervised approach to identify text segments (sentences)
    relevant to the criteria. A binary classifier trained to identify publications
    that met the criteria performs better when trained on the candidate sentences
    than when trained on sentences randomly picked from the text, supporting the intuition
    that our method is able to accurately identify study descriptors.

  abstract: Parallel aligned sentences provide useful information for different NLP
    applications. Yet, this kind of data is seldom available, especially for languages
    other than English. We propose to exploit comparable corpora in French which are
    distinguished by their registers (specialized and simplified versions) to detect
    and align parallel sentences. These corpora are related to the biomedical area.
    Our purpose is to state whether a given pair of specialized and simplified sentences
    is to be aligned or not. Manually created reference data show 0.76 inter-annotator
    agreement. We exploit a set of features and several automatic classifiers. The
    automatic alignment reaches up to 0.93 Precision, Recall and F-measure. In order
    to better evaluate the method, it is applied to data in English from the SemEval
    STS competitions. The same features and models are applied in monolingual and
    cross-lingual contexts, in which they show up to 0.90 and 0.73 F-measure, respectively.

  abstract: "We present our initial evaluation of a prototype system designed to assist\
    \ nurses in assigning subject headings to nursing narratives \u2013 written in\
    \ the context of documenting patient care in hospitals. Currently nurses may need\
    \ to memorize several hundred subject headings from standardized nursing terminologies\
    \ when structuring and assigning the right section/subject headings to their text.\
    \ Our aim is to allow nurses to write in a narrative manner without having to\
    \ plan and structure the text with respect to sections and subject headings, instead\
    \ the system should assist with the assignment of subject headings and restructuring\
    \ afterwards. We hypothesize that this could reduce the time and effort needed\
    \ for nursing documentation in hospitals. A central component of the system is\
    \ a text classification model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent\
    \ neural network architecture, trained on a large data set of nursing notes. A\
    \ simple Web-based interface has been implemented for user interaction. To evaluate\
    \ the system, three nurses write a set of artificial nursing shift notes in a\
    \ fully unstructured narrative manner, without planning for or consider the use\
    \ of sections and subject headings. These are then fed to the system which assigns\
    \ subject headings to each sentence and then groups them into paragraphs. Manual\
    \ evaluation is conducted by a group of nurses. The results show that about 70%\
    \ of the sentences are assigned to correct subject headings. The nurses believe\
    \ that such a system can be of great help in making nursing documentation in hospitals\
    \ easier and less time consuming. Finally, various measures and approaches for\
    \ improving the system are discussed."

  abstract: Psychiatric evaluation reports represent a rich and still mostly-untapped
    source of information for developing systems for automatic diagnosis and treatment
    of mental health problems. These reports contain free-text structured within sections
    using a convention of headings. We present a model for automatically detecting
    the position and type of different psychiatric evaluation report sections. We
    developed this model using a corpus of 150 sample reports that we gathered from
    the Web, and used sentences as a processing unit while section headings were used
    as labels of section type. From these labels we generated a unified hierarchy
    of labels of section types, and then learned n-gram models of the language found
    in each section. To model conventions for section order, we integrated these n-gram
    models with a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) representing the probabilities
    of observed section orders found in the corpus, and then used this HHMM n-gram
    model in a decoding framework to infer the most likely section boundaries and
    section types for documents with their section labels removed. We evaluated our
    model over two tasks, namely, identifying section boundaries and identifying section
    types and orders. Our model significantly outperformed baselines for each task
    with an F1 of 0.88 for identifying section types, and a 0.26 WindowDiff (Wd) and
    0.20 and (Pk) scores, respectively, for identifying section boundaries.

  abstract: "In this article, we describe the development of annotation guidelines\
    \ for family history information in Norwegian clinical text. We make use of incrementally\
    \ developed synthetic clinical text describing patients\u2019 family history relating\
    \ to cases of cardiac disease and present a general methodology which integrates\
    \ the synthetically produced clinical statements and guideline development. We\
    \ analyze inter-annotator agreement based on the developed guidelines and present\
    \ results from experiments aimed at evaluating the validity and applicability\
    \ of the annotated corpus using machine learning techniques. The resulting annotated\
    \ corpus contains 477 sentences and 6030 tokens. Both the annotation guidelines\
    \ and the annotated corpus are made freely available and as such constitutes the\
    \ first publicly available resource of Norwegian clinical text."

  abstract: Textual corpora are extremely important for various NLP applications as
    they provide information necessary for creating, setting and testing these applications
    and the corresponding tools. They are also crucial for designing reliable methods
    and reproducible results. Yet, in some areas, such as the medical area, due to
    confidentiality or to ethical reasons, it is complicated and even impossible to
    access textual data representative of those produced in these areas. We propose
    the CAS corpus built with clinical cases, such as they are reported in the published
    scientific literature in French. We describe this corpus, currently containing
    over 397,000 word occurrences, and the existing linguistic and semantic annotations.

  abstract: Readmission after discharge from a hospital is disruptive and costly,
    regardless of the reason. However, it can be particularly problematic for psychiatric
    patients, so predicting which patients may be readmitted is critically important
    but also very difficult. Clinical narratives in psychiatric electronic health
    records (EHRs) span a wide range of topics and vocabulary; therefore, a psychiatric
    readmission prediction model must begin with a robust and interpretable topic
    extraction component. We created a data pipeline for using document vector similarity
    metrics to perform topic extraction on psychiatric EHR data in service of our
    long-term goal of creating a readmission risk classifier. We show initial results
    for our topic extraction model and identify additional features we will be incorporating
    in the future.

  abstract: We present an operational component of a real-world patient triage system.
    Given a specific patient presentation, the system is able to assess the level
    of medical urgency and issue the most appropriate recommendation in terms of best
    point of care and time to treat. We use an attention-based convolutional neural
    network architecture trained on 600,000 doctor notes in German. We compare two
    approaches, one that uses the full text of the medical notes and one that uses
    only a selected list of medical entities extracted from the text. These approaches
    achieve 79% and 66% precision, respectively, but on a confidence threshold of
    0.6, precision increases to 85% and 75%, respectively. In addition, a method to
    detect warning symptoms is implemented to render the classification task transparent
    from a medical perspective. The method is based on the learning of attention scores
    and a method of automatic validation using the same data.

  abstract: Transfer learning (TL) proposes to enhance machine learning performance
    on a problem, by reusing labeled data originally designed for a related problem.
    In particular, domain adaptation consists, for a specific task, in reusing training
    data developed for the same task but a distinct domain. This is particularly relevant
    to the applications of deep learning in Natural Language Processing, because those
    usually require large annotated corpora that may not exist for the targeted domain,
    but exist for side domains. In this paper, we experiment with TL for the task
    of Relation Extraction (RE) from biomedical texts, using the TreeLSTM model. We
    empirically show the impact of TreeLSTM alone and with domain adaptation by obtaining
    better performances than the state of the art on two biomedical RE tasks and equal
    performances for two others, for which few annotated data are available. Furthermore,
    we propose an analysis of the role that syntactic features may play in TL for
    RE.

  abstract: Rapidly expanding volume of publications in the biomedical domain makes
    it increasingly difficult for a timely evaluation of the latest literature. That,
    along with a push for automated evaluation of clinical reports, present opportunities
    for effective natural language processing methods. In this study we target the
    problem of named entity recognition, where texts are processed to annotate terms
    that are relevant for biomedical studies. Terms of interest in the domain include
    gene and protein names, and cell lines and types. Here we report on a pipeline
    built on Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) and a deep learning package for
    natural language processing (AllenNLP). We trained context-aware token embeddings
    on a dataset of biomedical papers using ELMo, and incorporated these embeddings
    in the LSTM-CRF model used by AllenNLP for named entity recognition. We show these
    representations improve named entity recognition for different types of biomedical
    named entities. We also achieve a new state of the art in gene mention detection
    on the BioCreative II gene mention shared task.

  abstract: Neural network models are oftentimes restricted by limited labeled instances
    and resort to advanced architectures and features for cutting edge performance.
    We propose to build a recurrent neural network with multiple semantically heterogeneous
    embeddings within a self-training framework. Our framework makes use of labeled,
    unlabeled, and social media data, operates on basic features, and is scalable
    and generalizable. With this method, we establish the state-of-the-art result
    for both in- and cross-domain for a clinical temporal relation extraction task.

  abstract: For psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, longer durations of untreated
    psychosis are associated with worse intervention outcomes. Data included in electronic
    health records (EHRs) can be useful for retrospective clinical studies, but much
    of this is stored as unstructured text which cannot be directly used in computation.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods can be used to extract this data, in
    order to identify symptoms and treatments from mental health records, and temporally
    anchor the first emergence of these. We are developing an EHR corpus annotated
    with time expressions, clinical entities and their relations, to be used for NLP
    development. In this study, we focus on the first step, identifying time expressions
    in EHRs for patients with schizophrenia. We developed a gold standard corpus,
    compared this corpus to other related corpora in terms of content and time expression
    prevalence, and adapted two NLP systems for extracting time expressions. To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first resource annotated for temporal entities
    in the mental health domain.

  abstract: Many applications in biomedical natural language processing rely on sequence
    tagging as an initial step to perform more complex analysis. To support text analysis
    in the biomedical domain, we introduce Yet Another SEquence Tagger (YASET), an
    open-source multi purpose sequence tagger that implements state-of-the-art deep
    learning algorithms for sequence tagging. Herein, we evaluate YASET on part-of-speech
    tagging and named entity recognition in a variety of text genres including articles
    from the biomedical literature in English and clinical narratives in French. To
    further characterize performance, we report distributions over 30 runs and different
    sizes of training datasets. YASET provides state-of-the-art performance on the
    CoNLL 2003 NER dataset (F1=0.87), MEDPOST corpus (F1=0.97), MERLoT corpus (F1=0.99)
    and NCBI disease corpus (F1=0.81). We believe that YASET is a versatile and efficient
    tool that can be used for sequence tagging in biomedical and clinical texts.

  abstract: The Impression section of a radiology report summarizes crucial radiology
    findings in natural language and plays a central role in communicating these findings
    to physicians. However, the process of generating impressions by summarizing findings
    is time-consuming for radiologists and prone to errors. We propose to automate
    the generation of radiology impressions with neural sequence-to-sequence learning.
    We further propose a customized neural model for this task which learns to encode
    the study background information and use this information to guide the decoding
    process. On a large dataset of radiology reports collected from actual hospital
    studies, our model outperforms existing non-neural and neural baselines under
    the ROUGE metrics. In a blind experiment, a board-certified radiologist indicated
    that 67% of sampled system summaries are at least as good as the corresponding
    human-written summaries, suggesting significant clinical validity. To our knowledge
    our work represents the first attempt in this direction.

  abstract: "The overall objective of \u2018social\u2019 dialogue systems is to support\
    \ engaging, entertaining, and lengthy conversations on a wide variety of topics,\
    \ including social chit-chat. Apart from raw dialogue data, user-provided ratings\
    \ are the most common signal used to train such systems to produce engaging responses.\
    \ In this paper we show that social dialogue systems can be trained effectively\
    \ from raw unannotated data. Using a dataset of real conversations collected in\
    \ the 2017 Alexa Prize challenge, we developed a neural ranker for selecting \u2018\
    good\u2019 system responses to user utterances, i.e. responses which are likely\
    \ to lead to long and engaging conversations. We show that (1) our neural ranker\
    \ consistently outperforms several strong baselines when trained to optimise for\
    \ user ratings; (2) when trained on larger amounts of data and only using conversation\
    \ length as the objective, the ranker performs better than the one trained using\
    \ ratings \u2013 ultimately reaching a Precision@1 of 0.87. This advance will\
    \ make data collection for social conversational agents simpler and less expensive\
    \ in the future."

  abstract: Solving composites tasks, which consist of several inherent sub-tasks,
    remains a challenge in the research area of dialogue. Current studies have tackled
    this issue by manually decomposing the composite tasks into several sub-domains.
    However, much human effort is inevitable. This paper proposes a dialogue framework
    that autonomously models meaningful sub-domains and learns the policy over them.
    Our experiments show that our framework outperforms the baseline without subdomains
    by 11% in terms of success rate, and is competitive with that with manually defined
    sub-domains.

  abstract: In this section we propose a reasoning-based approach to a dialogue management
    for a customer support chat bot. To build a dialogue scenario, we analyze the
    discourse tree (DT) of an initial query of a customer support dialogue that is
    frequently complex and multi-sentence. We then enforce rhetorical agreement between
    DT of the initial query and that of the answers, requests and responses. The chat
    bot finds answers, which are not only relevant by topic but also suitable for
    a given step of a conversation and match the question by style, communication
    means, experience level and other domain-independent attributes. We evaluate a
    performance of proposed algorithm in car repair domain and observe a 5 to 10%
    improvement for single and three-step dialogues respectively, in comparison with
    baseline approaches to dialogue management.

  abstract: "In task-oriented conversational agents, more attention has been usually\
    \ devoted to assessing task effectiveness, rather than to how the task is achieved.\
    \ However, conversational agents are moving towards more complex and human-like\
    \ interaction capabilities (e.g. the ability to use a formal/informal register,\
    \ to show an empathetic behavior), for which standard evaluation methodologies\
    \ may not suffice. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology to assess - in\
    \ a completely controlled way - the impact on the quality of experience of agent\u2019\
    s interaction strategies. The methodology is based on a within subject design,\
    \ where two slightly different transcripts of the same interaction with a conversational\
    \ agent are presented to the user. Through a series of pilot experiments we prove\
    \ that this methodology allows fast and cheap experimentation/evaluation, focusing\
    \ on aspects that are overlooked by current methods."

  abstract: Search-oriented conversational systems rely on information needs expressed
    in natural language (NL). We focus here on the understanding of NL expressions
    for building keyword-based queries. We propose a reinforcement-learning-driven
    translation model framework able to 1) learn the translation from NL expressions
    to queries in a supervised way, and, 2) to overcome the lack of large-scale dataset
    by framing the translation model as a word selection approach and injecting relevance
    feedback as a reward in the learning process. Experiments are carried out on two
    TREC datasets. We outline the effectiveness of our approach.

  abstract: Learning from sparse and delayed reward is a central issue in reinforcement
    learning. In this paper, to tackle reward sparseness problem of task oriented
    dialogue management, we propose a curriculum based approach on the number of slots
    of user goals. This curriculum makes it possible to learn dialogue management
    for sets of user goals with large number of slots. We also propose a dialogue
    policy based on progressive neural networks whose modules with parameters are
    appended with previous parameters fixed as the curriculum proceeds, and this policy
    improves performances over the one with single set of parameters.

  abstract: Data augmentation seeks to manipulate the available data for training
    to improve the generalization ability of models. We investigate two data augmentation
    proxies, permutation and flipping, for neural dialog response selection task on
    various models over multiple datasets, including both Chinese and English languages.
    Different from standard data augmentation techniques, our method combines the
    original and synthesized data for prediction. Empirical results show that our
    approach can gain 1 to 3 recall-at-1 points over baseline models in both full-scale
    and small-scale settings.

  abstract: 'Multimodal search-based dialogue is a challenging new task: It extends
    visually grounded question answering systems into multi-turn conversations with
    access to an external database. We address this new challenge by learning a neural
    response generation system from the recently released Multimodal Dialogue (MMD)
    dataset (Saha et al., 2017). We introduce a knowledge-grounded multimodal conversational
    model where an encoded knowledge base (KB) representation is appended to the decoder
    input. Our model substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of text-based
    similarity measures (over 9 BLEU points, 3 of which are solely due to the use
    of additional information from the KB).'

  abstract: "Most of the world\u2019s data is stored in relational databases. Accessing\
    \ these requires specialized knowledge of the Structured Query Language (SQL),\
    \ putting them out of the reach of many people. A recent research thread in Natural\
    \ Language Processing (NLP) aims to alleviate this problem by automatically translating\
    \ natural language questions into SQL queries. While the proposed solutions are\
    \ a great start, they lack robustness and do not easily generalize: the methods\
    \ require high quality descriptions of the database table columns, and the most\
    \ widely used training dataset, WikiSQL, is heavily biased towards using those\
    \ descriptions as part of the questions. In this work, we propose solutions to\
    \ both problems: we entirely eliminate the need for column descriptions, by relying\
    \ solely on their contents, and we augment the WikiSQL dataset by paraphrasing\
    \ column names to reduce bias. We show that the accuracy of existing methods drops\
    \ when trained on our augmented, column-agnostic dataset, and that our own method\
    \ reaches state of the art accuracy, while relying on column contents only."

  abstract: Slot filling is a crucial task in the Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
    component of a dialogue system. Most approaches for this task rely solely on the
    domain-specific datasets for training. We propose a joint model of slot filling
    and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in a multi-task learning (MTL) setup. Our experiments
    on three slot filling datasets show that using NER as an auxiliary task improves
    slot filling performance and achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art.
    In particular, NER is effective when supervised at the lower layer of the model.
    For low-resource scenarios, we found that MTL is effective for one dataset.

  abstract: 'Diversity is a long-studied topic in information retrieval that usually
    refers to the requirement that retrieved results should be non-repetitive and
    cover different aspects. In a conversational setting, an additional dimension
    of diversity matters: an engaging response generation system should be able to
    output responses that are diverse and interesting. Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
    models have been shown to be very effective for response generation. However,
    dialogue responses generated by Seq2Seq models tend to have low diversity. In
    this paper, we review known sources and existing approaches to this low-diversity
    problem. We also identify a source of low diversity that has been little studied
    so far, namely model over-confidence. We sketch several directions for tackling
    model over-confidence and, hence, the low-diversity problem, including confidence
    penalties and label smoothing.'

  abstract: "Sequence generation models for dialogue are known to have several problems:\
    \ they tend to produce short, generic sentences that are uninformative and unengaging.\
    \ Retrieval models on the other hand can surface interesting responses, but are\
    \ restricted to the given retrieval set leading to erroneous replies that cannot\
    \ be tuned to the specific context. In this work we develop a model that combines\
    \ the two approaches to avoid both their deficiencies: first retrieve a response\
    \ and then refine it \u2013 the final sequence generator treating the retrieval\
    \ as additional context. We show on the recent ConvAI2 challenge task our approach\
    \ produces responses superior to both standard retrieval and generation models\
    \ in human evaluations."

  abstract: "We investigate the lexical network properties of the large phoneme inventory\
    \ Southern African language Mangetti Dune !Xung as it compares to English and\
    \ other commonly-studied languages. Lexical networks are graphs in which nodes\
    \ (words) are linked to their minimal pairs; global properties of these networks\
    \ are believed to mediate lexical access in the minds of speakers. We show that\
    \ the network properties of !Xung are within the range found in previously-studied\
    \ languages. By simulating data (\u201Dpseudolexicons\u201D) with varying levels\
    \ of phonotactic structure, we find that the lexical network properties of !Xung\
    \ diverge from previously-studied languages when fewer phonotactic constraints\
    \ are retained. We conclude that lexical network properties are representative\
    \ of an underlying cognitive structure which is necessary for efficient word retrieval\
    \ and that the phonotactics of !Xung may be shaped by a selective pressure which\
    \ preserves network properties within this cognitively useful range."

  abstract: Computational Language Documentation attempts to make the most recent
    research in speech and language technologies available to linguists working on
    language preservation and documentation. In this paper, we pursue two main goals
    along these lines. The first is to improve upon a strong baseline for the unsupervised
    word discovery task on two very low-resource Bantu languages, taking advantage
    of the expertise of linguists on these particular languages. The second consists
    in exploring the Adaptor Grammar framework as a decision and prediction tool for
    linguists studying a new language. We experiment 162 grammar configurations for
    each language and show that using Adaptor Grammars for word segmentation enables
    us to test hypotheses about a language. Specializing a generic grammar with language
    specific knowledge leads to great improvements for the word discovery task, ultimately
    achieving a leap of about 30% token F-score from the results of a strong baseline.

  abstract: Morphologically rich languages are challenging for natural language processing
    tasks due to data sparsity. This can be addressed either by introducing out-of-context
    morphological knowledge, or by developing machine learning architectures that
    specifically target data sparsity and/or morphological information. We find these
    approaches to complement each other in a morphological paradigm modeling task
    in Modern Standard Arabic, which, in addition to being morphologically complex,
    features ubiquitous ambiguity, exacerbating sparsity with noise. Given a small
    number of out-of-context rules describing closed class morphology, we combine
    them with word embeddings leveraging subword strings and noise reduction techniques.
    The combination outperforms both approaches individually by about 20% absolute.
    While morphological resources already exist for Modern Standard Arabic, our results
    inform how comparable resources might be constructed for non-standard dialects
    or any morphologically rich, low resourced language, given scarcity of time and
    funding.

  abstract: This article describes a novel approach to the computational modeling
    of reduplication. Reduplication is a well-studied linguistic phenomenon. However,
    it is often treated as a stumbling block within finite-state treatments of morphology.
    Most finite-state implementations of computational morphology cannot adequately
    capture the productivity of unbounded copying in reduplication, nor can they adequately
    capture bounded copying. We show that an understudied type of finite-state machines,
    two-way finite-state transducers (2-way FSTs), captures virtually all reduplicative
    processes, including total reduplication. 2-way FSTs can model reduplicative typology
    in a way which is convenient, easy to design and debug in practice, and linguistically-motivated.
    By virtue of being finite-state, 2-way FSTs are likewise incorporable into existing
    finite-state systems and programs. A small but representative typology of reduplicative
    processes is described in this article, alongside their corresponding 2-way FST
    models.

  abstract: Morphological segmentation is beneficial for several natural language
    processing tasks dealing with large vocabularies. Unsupervised methods for morphological
    segmentation are essential for handling a diverse set of languages, including
    low-resource languages. Eskander et al. (2016) introduced a Language Independent
    Morphological Segmenter (LIMS) using Adaptor Grammars (AG) based on the best-on-average
    performing AG configuration. However, while LIMS worked best on average and outperforms
    other state-of-the-art unsupervised morphological segmentation approaches, it
    did not provide the optimal AG configuration for five out of the six languages.
    We propose two language-independent classifiers that enable the selection of the
    optimal or nearly-optimal configuration for the morphological segmentation of
    unseen languages.

  abstract: Japanese Katakana is one component of the Japanese writing system and
    is used to express English terms, loanwords, and onomatopoeia in Japanese characters
    based on the phonemes. The main purpose of this research is to find the best entity
    matching methods between English and Katakana. We built two research questions
    to clarify which types of entity matching systems works better than others. The
    first question is what transliteration should be used for conversion. We need
    to transliterate English or Katakana terms into the same form in order to compute
    the string similarity. We consider five conversions that transliterate English
    to Katakana directly, Katakana to English directly, English to Katakana via phoneme,
    Katakana to English via phoneme, and both English and Katakana to phoneme. The
    second question is what should be used for the similarity measure at entity matching.
    To investigate the problem, we choose six methods, which are Overlap Coefficient,
    Cosine, Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein, and the similarity of the phoneme
    probability predicted by RNN. Our results show that 1) matching using phonemes
    and conversion of Katakana to English works better than other methods, and 2)
    the similarity of phonemes outperforms other methods while other similarity score
    is changed depending on data and models.

  abstract: Natural language reduplication can pose a challenge to neural models of
    language, and has been argued to require variables (Marcus et al., 1999). Sequence-to-sequence
    neural networks have been shown to perform well at a number of other morphological
    tasks (Cotterell et al., 2016), and produce results that highly correlate with
    human behavior (Kirov, 2017; Kirov & Cotterell, 2018) but do not include any explicit
    variables in their architecture. We find that they can learn a reduplicative pattern
    that generalizes to novel segments if they are trained with dropout (Srivastava
    et al., 2014). We argue that this matches the scope of generalization observed
    in human reduplication.

  abstract: This study explores a number of data-driven vector representations of
    the IPA-encoded sound segments for the purpose of sound sequence alignment. We
    test the alternative representations based on the alignment accuracy in the context
    of computational historical linguistics. We show that the data-driven methods
    consistently do better than linguistically-motivated articulatory-acoustic features.
    The similarity scores obtained using the data-driven representations in a monolingual
    context, however, performs worse than the state-of-the-art distance (or similarity)
    scoring methods proposed in earlier studies of computational historical linguistics.
    We also show that adapting representations to the task at hand improves the results,
    yielding alignment accuracy comparable to the state of the art methods.

  abstract: Quantifying and predicting morphological productivity is a long-standing
    challenge in corpus linguistics and psycholinguistics. The same challenge reappears
    in natural language processing in the context of handling words that were not
    seen in the training set (out-of-vocabulary, or OOV, words). Prior research showed
    that a good indicator of the productivity of a morpheme is the number of words
    involving it that occur exactly once (the hapax legomena). A technical connection
    was adduced between this result and Good-Turing smoothing, which assigns probability
    mass to unseen events on the basis of the simplifying assumption that word frequencies
    are stationary. In a large-scale study of 133 affixes in Wikipedia, we develop
    evidence that success in fact depends on tapping the frequency range in which
    the assumptions of Good-Turing are violated.

    a low-resourced native language spoken in the Amazonian region of Peru. We resort
    to the robustness of finite-state systems in order to model the complex morphosyntax
    of the language. Evaluation over raw corpora shows promising coverage of grammatical
    phenomena, limited only by the scarce lexicon. We make this tool freely available
    so as to aid the production of annotated corpora and impulse further research
    in native languages of Peru.

  abstract: "Sanskrit /n/-retroflexion is one of the most complex segmental processes\
    \ in phonology. While it is still star-free, it does not fit in any of the subregular\
    \ classes that are commonly entertained in the literature. We show that when construed\
    \ as a phonotactic dependency, the process fits into a class we call input-output\
    \ tier-based strictly local (IO-TSL), a natural extension of the familiar class\
    \ TSL. IO-TSL increases the power of TSL\u2019s tier projection function by making\
    \ it an input-output strictly local transduction. Assuming that /n/-retroflexion\
    \ represents the upper bound on the complexity of segmental phonology, this shows\
    \ that all of segmental phonology can be captured by combining the intuitive notion\
    \ of tiers with the independently motivated machinery of strictly local mappings."

  abstract: Modeling morphological inflection is an important task in Natural Language
    Processing. In contrast to earlier work that has largely used orthographic representations,
    we experiment with this task in a phonetic character space, representing inputs
    as either IPA segments or bundles of phonological distinctive features. We show
    that both of these inputs, somewhat counterintuitively, achieve similar accuracies
    on morphological inflection, slightly lower than orthographic models. We conclude
    that providing detailed phonological representations is largely redundant when
    compared to IPA segments, and that articulatory distinctions relevant for word
    inflection are already latently present in the distributional properties of many
    graphemic writing systems.

  abstract: Probabilistic approaches have proven themselves well in learning phonological
    structure. In contrast, theoretical linguistics usually works with deterministic
    generalizations. The goal of this paper is to explore possible interactions between
    information-theoretic methods and deterministic linguistic knowledge and to examine
    some ways in which both can be used in tandem to extract phonological and morphophonological
    patterns from a small annotated dataset. Local and nonlocal processes in Mishar
    Tatar (Turkic/Kipchak) are examined as a case study.

  abstract: In many societies alcohol is a legal and common recreational substance
    and socially accepted. Alcohol consumption often comes along with social events
    as it helps people to increase their sociability and to overcome their inhibitions.
    On the other hand we know that increased alcohol consumption can lead to serious
    health issues, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the digestive
    system, to mention a few. This work examines alcohol consumption during the FIFA
    Football World Cup 2018, particularly the usage of alcohol related information
    on Twitter. For this we analyse the tweeting behaviour and show that the tournament
    strongly increases the interest in beer. Furthermore we show that countries who
    had to leave the tournament at early stage might have done something good to their
    fans as the interest in beer decreased again.

  abstract: The occurrence of stance-taking towards vaccination was measured in documents
    extracted by topic modelling from two different corpora, one discussion forum
    corpus and one tweet corpus. For some of the topics extracted, their most closely
    associated documents contained a proportion of vaccine stance-taking texts that
    exceeded the corpus average by a large margin. These extracted document sets would,
    therefore, form a useful resource in a process for computer-assisted analysis
    of argumentation on the subject of vaccination.

  abstract: This paper presents a set of classification experiments for identifying
    depression in posts gathered from social media platforms. In addition to the data
    gathered previously by other researchers, we collect additional data from the
    social media platform Reddit. Our experiments show promising results for identifying
    depression from social media texts. More importantly, however, we show that the
    choice of corpora is crucial in identifying depression and can lead to misleading
    conclusions in case of poor choice of data.

  abstract: The goals of the SMM4H shared tasks are to release annotated social media
    based health related datasets to the research community, and to compare the performances
    of natural language processing and machine learning systems on tasks involving
    these datasets. The third execution of the SMM4H shared tasks, co-hosted with
    EMNLP-2018, comprised of four subtasks. These subtasks involve annotated user
    posts from Twitter (tweets) and focus on the (i) automatic classification of tweets
    mentioning a drug name, (ii) automatic classification of tweets containing reports
    of first-person medication intake, (iii) automatic classification of tweets presenting
    self-reports of adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection, and (iv) automatic classification
    of vaccine behavior mentions in tweets. A total of 14 teams participated and 78
    system runs were submitted (23 for task 1, 20 for task 2, 18 for task 3, 17 for
    task 4).

  abstract: Previous research has linked psychological and social variables to physical
    health. At the same time, psychological and social variables have been successfully
    predicted from the language used by individuals in social media. In this paper,
    we conduct an initial exploratory study linking these two areas. Using the social
    media platform of Twitter, we identify users self-reporting symptoms that are
    descriptive of influenza-like illness (ILI). We analyze the tweets of those users
    in the periods before, during, and after the reported symptoms, exploring emotional,
    cognitive, and structural components of language. We observe a post-ILI increase
    in social activity and cognitive processes, possibly supporting previous offline
    findings linking more active social activities and stronger cognitive coping skills
    to a better immune status.

  abstract: Social media-based text mining in healthcare has received special attention
    in recent times due to the enhanced accessibility of social media sites like Twitter.
    The increasing trend of spreading important information in distress can help patients
    reach out to prospective blood donors in a time bound manner. However such manual
    efforts are mostly inefficient due to the limited network of a user. In a novel
    step to solve this problem, we present an annotated Emergency Blood Donation Request
    (EBDR) dataset to classify tweets referring to the necessity of urgent blood donation
    requirement. Additionally, we also present an automated feature-based SVM classification
    technique that can help selective EBDR tweets reach relevant personals as well
    as medical authorities. Our experiments also present a quantitative evidence that
    linguistic along with handcrafted heuristics can act as the most representative
    set of signals this task with an accuracy of 97.89%.

  abstract: This paper describes our system for the first and third shared tasks of
    the third Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) workshop, which
    aims to detect the tweets mentioning drug names and adverse drug reactions. In
    our system we propose a neural approach with hierarchical tweet representation
    and multi-head self-attention (HTR-MSA) for both tasks. Our system achieved the
    first place in both the first and third shared tasks of SMM4H with an F-score
    of 91.83% and 52.20% respectively.

  abstract: This paper describes the system that team UChicagoCompLx developed for
    the 2018 Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) Shared Task. We use
    a variant of the Message-level Sentiment Analysis (MSA) model of (Baziotis et
    al., 2017), a word-level stacked bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
    equipped with attention, to classify medication-related tweets in the four subtasks
    of the SMM4H Shared Task. Without any subtask-specific tuning, the model is able
    to achieve competitive results across all subtasks. We make the datasets, model
    weights, and code publicly available.

  abstract: 'Vaccination behaviour detection deals with predicting whether or not
    a person received/was about to receive a vaccine. We present our submission for
    vaccination behaviour detection shared task at the SMM4H workshop. Our findings
    are based on three prevalent text classification approaches: rule-based, statistical
    and deep learning-based. Our final submissions are: (1) an ensemble of statistical
    classifiers with task-specific features derived using lexicons, language processing
    tools and word embeddings; and, (2) a LSTM classifier with pre-trained language
    models.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the system submitted for the shared task on
    Social Media Mining for Health Applications by the team Light. Previous works
    demonstrate that LSTMs have achieved remarkable performance in natural language
    processing tasks. We deploy an ensemble of two LSTM models. The first one is a
    pretrained language model appended with a classifier and takes words as input,
    while the second one is a LSTM model with an attention unit over it which takes
    character tri-gram as input. We call the ensemble of these two models: Neural-DrugNet.
    Our system ranks 2nd in the second shared task: Automatic classification of posts
    describing medication intake.'

  abstract: This paper describes the systems developed by IRISA to participate to
    the four tasks of the SMM4H 2018 challenge. For these tweet classification tasks,
    we adopt a common approach based on recurrent neural networks (BiLSTM). Our main
    contributions are the use of certain features, the use of Bagging in order to
    deal with unbalanced datasets, and on the automatic selection of difficult examples.
    These techniques allow us to reach 91.4, 46.5, 47.8, 85.0 as F1-scores for Tasks
    1 to 4.

  abstract: This paper describes our systems in social media mining for health applications
    (SMM4H) shared task. We participated in all four tracks of the shared task using
    linear models with a combination of character and word n-gram features. We did
    not use any external data or domain specific information. The resulting systems
    achieved above-average scores among other participating systems, with F1-scores
    of 91.22, 46.8, 42.4, and 85.53 on tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

  abstract: "We describe our submissions to the Third Social Media Mining for Health\
    \ Applications Shared Task. We participated in two tasks (tasks 1 and 3). For\
    \ both tasks, we experimented with a traditional machine learning model (Naive\
    \ Bayes Support Vector Machine (NBSVM)), deep learning models (Convolutional Neural\
    \ Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)),\
    \ and the combination of deep learning model with SVM. We observed that the NBSVM\
    \ reaches superior performance on both tasks on our development split of the training\
    \ data sets. Official result for task 1 based on the blind evaluation data shows\
    \ that the predictions of the NBSVM achieved our team\u2019s best F-score of 0.910\
    \ which is above the average score received by all submissions to the task. On\
    \ task 3, the combination of of BiLSTM and SVM gives our best F-score for the\
    \ positive class of 0.394."

  abstract: This paper describes the systems developed for 1st and 2nd tasks of the
    3rd Social Media Mining for Health Applications Shared Task at EMNLP 2018. The
    first task focuses on automatic detection of posts mentioning a drug name or dietary
    supplement, a binary classification. The second task is about distinguishing the
    tweets that present personal medication intake, possible medication intake and
    non-intake. We performed extensive experiments with various classifiers like Logistic
    Regression, Random Forest, SVMs, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and deep
    learning architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), jointed
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM architecture, and attention based
    LSTM architecture both at word and character level. We have also explored using
    various pre-trained embeddings like Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe),
    Word2Vec and task-specific embeddings learned using CNN-LSTM and LSTMs.

    \ The paper illustrates a new incremental method for enhancing treebanks, with\
    \ particular emphasis on the extension of error patterns across different textual\
    \ genres and registers. Impact and role of corrections have been assessed in a\
    \ dependency parsing experiment carried out with four different parsers, whose\
    \ results are promising. For both evaluation datasets, the performance of parsers\
    \ increases, in terms of the standard LAS and UAS measures and of a more focused\
    \ measure taking into account only relations involved in error patterns, and at\
    \ the level of individual dependencies."

  abstract: We evaluate corpus-based measures of linguistic complexity obtained using
    Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. We propose a method of estimating robustness
    of the complexity values obtained using a given measure and a given treebank.
    The results indicate that measures of syntactic complexity might be on average
    less robust than those of morphological complexity. We also estimate the validity
    of complexity measures by comparing the results for very similar languages and
    checking for unexpected differences. We show that some of those differences that
    arise can be diminished by using parallel treebanks and, more importantly from
    the practical point of view, by harmonizing the language-specific solutions in
    the UD annotation.

  abstract: Although treebanks annotated according to the guidelines of Universal
    Dependencies (UD) now exist for many languages, the goal of annotating the same
    phenomena in a cross-linguistically consistent fashion is not always met. In this
    paper, we investigate one phenomenon where we believe such consistency is lacking,
    namely expletive elements. Such elements occupy a position that is structurally
    associated with a core argument (or sometimes an oblique dependent), yet are non-referential
    and semantically void. Many UD treebanks identify at least some elements as expletive,
    but the range of phenomena differs between treebanks, even for closely related
    languages, and sometimes even for different treebanks for the same language. In
    this paper, we present criteria for identifying expletives that are applicable
    across languages and compatible with the goals of UD, give an overview of expletives
    as found in current UD treebanks, and present recommendations for the annotation
    of expletives so that more consistent annotation can be achieved in future releases.

  abstract: This paper describes the changes applied to the original process used
    to convert the Index Thomisticus Treebank, a corpus including texts in Medieval
    Latin by Thomas Aquinas, into the annotation style of Universal Dependencies.
    The changes are made both to harmonise the Universal Dependencies version of the
    Index Thomisticus Treebank with the two other available Latin treebanks and to
    fix errors and inconsistencies resulting from the original process. The paper
    details the treatment of different issues in PoS tagging, lemmatisation and assignment
    of dependency relations. Finally, it assesses the quality of the new conversion
    process by providing an evaluation against a gold standard.

  abstract: Despite the significant improvement of data-driven dependency parsing
    systems in recent years, they still achieve a considerably lower performance in
    parsing spoken language data in comparison to written data. On the example of
    Spoken Slovenian Treebank, the first spoken data treebank using the UD annotation
    scheme, we investigate which speech-specific phenomena undermine parsing performance,
    through a series of training data and treebank modification experiments using
    two distinct state-of-the-art parsing systems. Our results show that utterance
    segmentation is the most prominent cause of low parsing performance, both in parsing
    raw and pre-segmented transcriptions. In addition to shorter utterances, both
    parsers perform better on normalized transcriptions including basic markers of
    prosody and excluding disfluencies, discourse markers and fillers. On the other
    hand, the effects of written training data addition and speech-specific dependency
    representations largely depend on the parsing system selected.

    in particular ellipsis. We report on several experiments in enrichment of training
    data for this specific construction, evaluated on five languages: Czech, English,
    Finnish, Russian and Slovak. These data enrichment methods draw upon self-training
    and tri-training, combined with a stratified sampling method mimicking the structural
    complexity of the original treebank. In addition, using these same methods, we
    also demonstrate small improvements over the CoNLL-17 parsing shared task winning
    system for four of the five languages, not only restricted to the elliptical constructions.'

  abstract: "The cost of integrating dependent constituents to their heads is thought\
    \ to involve the distance between dependent and head and the complexity of the\
    \ integration (Gibson, 1998). The former has been convincingly addressed by Dependency\
    \ Distance Minimization (DDM) (cf. Liu et al., 2017). The current study addresses\
    \ the latter by proposing a novel theory of integration complexity derived from\
    \ the entropy of the probability distribution of a dependent\u2019s heads. An\
    \ analysis of Universal Dependency corpora provides empirical evidence regarding\

    that is near-isomorphic to the Universal Dependencies (UD) annotation scheme while
    following distributional criteria for defining the dependency tree structure and
    the naming of the syntactic functions. Rule-based graph transformation grammars
    allow for a bi-directional transformation of UD into SUD. The back-and-forth transformation
    can serve as an error-mining tool to assure the intra-language and inter-language
    coherence of the UD treebanks.

  abstract: This paper discusses the representation of coordinate structures in the
    Universal Dependencies framework for two head-final languages, Japanese and Korean.
    UD applies a strict principle that makes the head of coordination the left-most
    conjunct. However, the guideline may produce syntactic trees which are difficult
    to accept in head-final languages. This paper describes the status in the current
    Japanese and Korean corpora and proposes alternative designs suitable for these
    languages.

  abstract: We evaluate two cross-lingual techniques for adding enhanced dependencies
    to existing treebanks in Universal Dependencies. We apply a rule-based system
    developed for English and a data-driven system trained on Finnish to Swedish and
    Italian. We find that both systems are accurate enough to bootstrap enhanced dependencies
    in existing UD treebanks. In the case of Italian, results are even on par with
    those of a prototype language-specific system.

  abstract: In this paper, for the purpose of enhancing Universal Dependencies for
    the Korean language, we propose a modified method for mapping Korean Part-of-Speech(POS)
    tagset in relation to Universal Part-of-Speech (UPOS) tagset in order to enhance
    the Universal Dependencies for the Korean Language. Previous studies suggest that
    UPOS reflects several issues that influence dependency annotation by using the
    POS of Korean predicates, particularly the distinctiveness in using verb, adjective,
    and copula.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe a corpus UD Japanese-BCCWJ that was created
    by converting the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ), a
    Japanese language corpus, to adhere to the UD annotation schema. The BCCWJ already
    assigns dependency information at the level of the bunsetsu (a Japanese syntactic
    unit comparable to the phrase). We developed a program to convert the BCCWJ to
    UD based on this dependency structure, and this corpus is the result of completely
    automatic conversion using the program. UD Japanese-BCCWJ is the largest-scale
    UD Japanese corpus and the second-largest of all UD corpora, including 1,980 documents,
    57,109 sentences, and 1,273k words across six distinct domains.

  abstract: The Hebrew treebank (HTB), consisting of 6221 morpho-syntactically annotated
    newspaper sentences, has been the only resource for training and validating statistical
    parsers and taggers for Hebrew, for almost two decades now. During these decades,
    the HTB has gone through a trajectory of automatic and semi-automatic conversions,
    until arriving at its UDv2 form. In this work we manually validate the UDv2 version
    of the HTB, and, according to our findings, we apply scheme changes that bring
    the UD HTB to the same theoretical grounds as the rest of UD. Our experimental
    parsing results with UDv2New confirm that improving the coherence and internal
    consistency of the UD HTB indeed leads to improved parsing performance. At the
    same time, our analysis demonstrates that there is more to be done at the point
    of intersection of UD with other linguistic processing layers, in particular,
    at the points where UD interfaces external morphological and lexical resources.

  abstract: This paper describes a method of creating synthetic treebanks for cross-lingual
    dependency parsing using a combination of machine translation (including pivot
    translation), annotation projection and the spanning tree algorithm. Sentences
    are first automatically translated from a lesser-resourced language to a number
    of related highly-resourced languages, parsed and then the annotations are projected
    back to the lesser-resourced language, leading to multiple trees for each sentence
    from the lesser-resourced language. The final treebank is created by merging the
    possible trees into a graph and running the spanning tree algorithm to vote for
    the best tree for each sentence. We present experiments aimed at parsing Faroese
    using a combination of Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. In a similar experimental
    setup to the CoNLL 2018 shared task on dependency parsing we report state-of-the-art
    results on dependency parsing for Faroese using an off-the-shelf parser.

  abstract: We present an initial version of the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebank
    for Shipibo-Konibo, the first South American, Amazonian, Panoan and Peruvian language
    with a resource built under UD. We describe the linguistic aspects of how the
    tagset was defined and the treebank was annotated; in addition we present our
    specific treatment of linguistic units called clitics. Although the treebank is
    still under development, it allowed us to perform a typological comparison against
    Spanish, the predominant language in Peru, and dependency syntax parsing experiments
    in both monolingual and cross-lingual approaches.

  abstract: We explore whether it is possible to build lighter parsers, that are statistically
    equivalent to their corresponding standard version, for a wide set of languages
    showing different structures and morphologies. As testbed, we use the Universal
    Dependencies and transition-based dependency parsers trained on feed-forward networks.
    For these, most existing research assumes de facto standard embedded features
    and relies on pre-computation tricks to obtain speed-ups. We explore how these
    features and their size can be reduced and whether this translates into speed-ups
    with a negligible impact on accuracy. The experiments show that grand-daughter
    features can be removed for the majority of treebanks without a significant (negative
    or positive) LAS difference. They also show how the size of the embeddings can
    be notably reduced.

  abstract: We present a general approach with reinforcement learning (RL) to approximate
    dynamic oracles for transition systems where exact dynamic oracles are difficult
    to derive. We treat oracle parsing as a reinforcement learning problem, design
    the reward function inspired by the classical dynamic oracle, and use Deep Q-Learning
    (DQN) techniques to train the oracle with gold trees as features. The combination
    of a priori knowledge and data-driven methods enables an efficient dynamic oracle,
    which improves the parser performance over static oracles in several transition
    systems.

  abstract: This paper presents the Coptic Universal Dependency Treebank, the first
    dependency treebank within the Egyptian subfamily of the Afro-Asiatic languages.
    We discuss the composition of the corpus, challenges in adapting the UD annotation
    scheme to existing conventions for annotating Coptic, and evaluate inter-annotator
    agreement on UD annotation for the language. Some specific constructions are taken
    as a starting point for discussing several more general UD annotation guidelines,
    in particular for appositions, ambiguous passivization, incorporation and object-doubling.

  abstract: "Sociolinguistics is often concerned with how variants of a linguistic\
    \ item (e.g., nothing vs. nothin\u2019) are used by different groups or in different\
    \ situations. We introduce the task of inducing lexical variables from code-mixed\
    \ text: that is, identifying equivalence pairs such as (football, fitba) along\
    \ with their linguistic code (football\u2192British, fitba\u2192Scottish). We\
    \ adapt a framework for identifying gender-biased word pairs to this new task,\
    \ and present results on three different pairs of English dialects, using tweets\
    \ as the code-mixed text. Our system achieves precision of over 70% for two of\
    \ these three datasets, and produces useful results even without extensive parameter\
    \ tuning. Our success in adapting this framework from gender to language variety\
    \ suggests that it could be used to discover other types of analogous pairs as\
    \ well."

  abstract: Automatic geolocation of microblog posts from their text content is particularly
    difficult because many location-indicative terms are rare terms, notably entity
    names such as locations, people or local organisations. Their low frequency means
    that key terms observed in testing are often unseen in training, such that standard
    classifiers are unable to learn weights for them. We propose a method for reasoning
    over such terms using a knowledge base, through exploiting their relations with
    other entities. Our technique uses a graph embedding over the knowledge base,
    which we couple with a text representation to learn a geolocation classifier,
    trained end-to-end. We show that our method improves over purely text-based methods,
    which we ascribe to more robust treatment of low-count and out-of-vocabulary entities.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce the first geolocation inference approach for
    reddit, a social media platform where user pseudonymity has thus far made supervised
    demographic inference difficult to implement and validate. In particular, we design
    a text-based heuristic schema to generate ground truth location labels for reddit
    users in the absence of explicitly geotagged data. After evaluating the accuracy
    of our labeling procedure, we train and test several geolocation inference models
    across our reddit data set and three benchmark Twitter geolocation data sets.
    Ultimately, we show that geolocation models trained and applied on the same domain
    substantially outperform models attempting to transfer training data across domains,
    even more so on reddit where platform-specific interest-group metadata can be
    used to improve inferences.

  abstract: Run-on sentences are common grammatical mistakes but little research has
    tackled this problem to date. This work introduces two machine learning models
    to correct run-on sentences that outperform leading methods for related tasks,
    punctuation restoration and whole-sentence grammatical error correction. Due to
    the limited annotated data for this error, we experiment with artificially generating
    training data from clean newswire text. Our findings suggest artificial training
    data is viable for this task. We discuss implications for correcting run-ons and
    other types of mistakes that have low coverage in error-annotated corpora.

  abstract: There has been very limited work on the adaptation of Part-Of-Speech (POS)
    tagging to learner English despite the fact that POS tagging is widely used in
    related tasks. In this paper, we explore how we can adapt POS tagging to learner
    English efficiently and effectively. Based on the discussion of possible causes
    of POS tagging errors in learner English, we show that deep neural models are
    particularly suitable for this. Considering the previous findings and the discussion,
    we introduce the design of our model based on bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory.
    In addition, we describe how to adapt it to a wide variety of native languages
    (potentially, hundreds of them). In the evaluation section, we empirically show
    that it is effective for POS tagging in learner English, achieving an accuracy
    of 0.964, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art POS-tagger. We
    further investigate the tagging results in detail, revealing which part of the
    model design does or does not improve the performance.

  abstract: Building tools for code-mixed data is rapidly gaining popularity in the
    NLP research community as such data is exponentially rising on social media. Working
    with code-mixed data contains several challenges, especially due to grammatical
    inconsistencies and spelling variations in addition to all the previous known
    challenges for social media scenarios. In this article, we present a novel architecture
    focusing on normalizing phonetic typing variations, which is commonly seen in
    code-mixed data. One of the main features of our architecture is that in addition
    to normalizing, it can also be utilized for back-transliteration and word identification
    in some cases. Our model achieved an accuracy of 90.27% on the test data.

  abstract: We suggest a new language-independent architecture of robust word vectors
    (RoVe). It is designed to alleviate the issue of typos, which are common in almost
    any user-generated content, and hinder automatic text processing. Our model is
    morphologically motivated, which allows it to deal with unseen word forms in morphologically
    rich languages. We present the results on a number of Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) tasks and languages for the variety of related architectures and show that
    proposed architecture is typo-proof.

  abstract: 'We perform automatic paraphrase detection on subtitle data from the Opusparcus
    corpus comprising six European languages: German, English, Finnish, French, Russian,
    and Swedish. We train two types of supervised sentence embedding models: a word-averaging
    (WA) model and a gated recurrent averaging network (GRAN) model. We find out that
    GRAN outperforms WA and is more robust to noisy training data. Better results
    are obtained with more and noisier data than less and cleaner data. Additionally,
    we experiment on other datasets, without reaching the same level of performance,
    because of domain mismatch between training and test data.'

  abstract: 'This work aims to detect specific attributes of a place (e.g., if it
    has a romantic atmosphere, or if it offers outdoor seating) from its user reviews
    via distant supervision: without direct annotation of the review text, we use
    the crowdsourced attribute labels of the place as labels of the review text. We
    then use review-level attention to pay more attention to those reviews related
    to the attributes. The experimental results show that our attention-based model
    predicts attributes for places from reviews with over 98% accuracy. The attention
    weights assigned to each review provide explanation of capturing relevant reviews.'

  abstract: We develop a grammatical error correction (GEC) system for German using
    a small gold GEC corpus augmented with edits extracted from Wikipedia revision
    history. We extend the automatic error annotation tool ERRANT (Bryant et al.,
    2017) for German and use it to analyze both gold GEC corrections and Wikipedia
    edits (Grundkiewicz and Junczys-Dowmunt, 2014) in order to select as additional
    training data Wikipedia edits containing grammatical corrections similar to those
    in the gold corpus. Using a multilayer convolutional encoder-decoder neural network
    GEC approach (Chollampatt and Ng, 2018), we evaluate the contribution of Wikipedia
    edits and find that carefully selected Wikipedia edits increase performance by
    over 5%.

  abstract: Despite the long history of named-entity recognition (NER) task in the
    natural language processing community, previous work rarely studied the task on
    conversational texts. Such texts are challenging because they contain a lot of
    word variations which increase the number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The
    high number of OOV words poses a difficulty for word-based neural models. Meanwhile,
    there is plenty of evidence to the effectiveness of character-based neural models
    in mitigating this OOV problem. We report an empirical evaluation of neural sequence
    labeling models with character embedding to tackle NER task in Indonesian conversational
    texts. Our experiments show that (1) character models outperform word embedding-only
    models by up to 4 F1 points, (2) character models perform better in OOV cases
    with an improvement of as high as 15 F1 points, and (3) character models are robust
    against a very high OOV rate.

  abstract: In text classification, the problem of overfitting arises due to the high
    dimensionality, making regularization essential. Although classic regularizers
    provide sparsity, they fail to return highly accurate models. On the contrary,
    state-of-the-art group-lasso regularizers provide better results at the expense
    of low sparsity. In this paper, we apply a greedy variable selection algorithm,
    called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, for the text classification task. We also
    extend standard group OMP by introducing overlapping Group OMP to handle overlapping
    groups of features. Empirical analysis verifies that both OMP and overlapping
    GOMP constitute powerful regularizers, able to produce effective and very sparse
    models. Code and data are available online.

  abstract: Industry datasets used for text classification are rarely created for
    that purpose. In most cases, the data and target predictions are a by-product
    of accumulated historical data, typically fraught with noise, present in both
    the text-based document, as well as in the targeted labels. In this work, we address
    the question of how well performance metrics computed on noisy, historical data
    reflect the performance on the intended future machine learning model input. The
    results demonstrate the utility of dirty training datasets used to build prediction
    models for cleaner (and different) prediction inputs.

  abstract: Code-switching (usage of different languages within a single conversation
    context in an alternative manner) is a highly increasing phenomenon in social
    media and colloquial usage which poses different challenges for natural language
    processing. This paper introduces the first study for the detection of Turkish-English
    code-switching and also a small test data collected from social media in order
    to smooth the way for further studies. The proposed system using character level
    n-grams and conditional random fields (CRFs) obtains 95.6% micro-averaged F1-score
    on the introduced test data set.

  abstract: In this paper we investigate the task of modeling how long it would take
    a student to respond to a tutor question during a tutoring dialogue. Solving such
    a task has applications in educational settings such as intelligent tutoring systems,
    as well as in platforms that help busy human tutors to keep students engaged.
    Knowing how long it would normally take a student to respond to different types
    of questions could help tutors optimize their own time while answering multiple
    dialogues concurrently, as well as deciding when to prompt a student again. We
    study this problem using data from a service that offers tutor support for math,
    chemistry and physics through an instant messaging platform. We create a dataset
    of 240K questions. We explore several strong baselines for this task and compare
    them with human performance.

  abstract: In this paper, we provide a lexical comparative analysis of the vocabulary
    used by customers and agents in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) environment
    and a potential solution to clean the data and extract relevant content for NLP.
    As a result, we demonstrate that the actual vocabulary for the language that prevails
    in the ERP conversations is highly divergent from the standardized dictionary
    and further different from general language usage as extracted from the Common
    Crawl corpus. Moreover, in specific business communication circumstances, where
    it is expected to observe a high usage of standardized language, code switching
    and non-standard expression are predominant, emphasizing once more the discrepancy
    between the day-to-day use of language and the standardized one.

  abstract: Community question answering (cQA) forums provide a rich source of data
    for facilitating non-factoid question answering over many technical domains. Given
    this, there is considerable interest in answer retrieval from these kinds of forums.
    However this is a difficult task as the structure of these forums is very rich,
    and both metadata and text features are important for successful retrieval. While
    there has recently been a lot of work on solving this problem using deep learning
    models applied to question/answer text, this work has not looked at how to make
    use of the rich metadata available in cQA forums. We propose an attention-based
    model which achieves state-of-the-art results for text-based answer selection
    alone, and by making use of complementary meta-data, achieves a substantially
    higher result over two reference datasets novel to this work.

  abstract: We propose a new word embedding method called word-like character n-gram
    embedding, which learns distributed representations of words by embedding word-like
    character n-grams. Our method is an extension of recently proposed segmentation-free
    word embedding, which directly embeds frequent character n-grams from a raw corpus.
    However, its n-gram vocabulary tends to contain too many non-word n-grams. We
    solved this problem by introducing an idea of expected word frequency. Compared
    to the previously proposed methods, our method can embed more words, along with
    the words that are not included in a given basic word dictionary. Since our method
    does not rely on word segmentation with rich word dictionaries, it is especially
    effective when the text in the corpus is in unsegmented language and contains
    many neologisms and informal words (e.g., Chinese SNS dataset). Our experimental
    results on Sina Weibo (a Chinese microblog service) and Twitter show that the
    proposed method can embed more words and improve the performance of downstream
    tasks.

  abstract: "One way to test a person\u2019s knowledge of a domain is to ask them\
    \ to define domain-specific terms. Here, we investigate the task of automatically\
    \ generating definitions of technical terms by reading text from the technical\
    \ domain. Specifically, we learn definitions of software entities from a large\
    \ corpus built from the user forum Stack Overflow. To model definitions, we train\
    \ a language model and incorporate additional domain-specific information like\
    \ word co-occurrence, and ontological category information. Our approach improves\
    \ previous baselines by 2 BLEU points for the definition generation task. Our\
    \ experiments also show the additional challenges associated with the task and\
    \ the short-comings of language-model based architectures for definition generation."

  abstract: A common need of NLP applications is to extract structured data from text
    corpora in order to perform analytics or trigger an appropriate action. The ontology
    defining the structure is typically application dependent and in many cases it
    is not known a priori. We describe the FrameIt System that provides a workflow
    for (1) quickly discovering an ontology to model a text corpus and (2) learning
    an SRL model that extracts the instances of the ontology from sentences in the
    corpus. FrameIt exploits data that is obtained in the ontology discovery phase
    as weak supervision data to bootstrap the SRL model and then enables the user
    to refine the model with active learning. We present empirical results and qualitative
    analysis of the performance of FrameIt on three corpora of noisy user-generated
    text.

  abstract: "Many social media classification tasks analyze the content of a message,\
    \ but do not consider the context of the message. For example, in tweet stance\
    \ classification \u2013 where a tweet is categorized according to a viewpoint\
    \ it espouses \u2013 the expressed viewpoint depends on latent beliefs held by\
    \ the user. In this paper we investigate whether incorporating knowledge about\
    \ the author can improve tweet stance classification. Furthermore, since author\
    \ information and embeddings are often unavailable for labeled training examples,\
    \ we propose a semi-supervised pretraining method to predict user embeddings.\
    \ Although the neural stance classifiers we learn are often outperformed by a\
    \ baseline SVM, author embedding pre-training yields improvements over a non-pre-trained\
    \ neural network on four out of five domains in the SemEval 2016 6A tweet stance\
    \ classification task. In a tweet gun control stance classification dataset, improvements\
    \ from pre-training are only apparent when training data is limited."

    \ most prevalent approaches to cross-lingual transfer learning. Conventional wisdom\
    \ suggests that annotation projection \u201Cjust works\u201D regardless of the\
    \ task at hand. We carefully consider multi-source projection for named entity\

    \ in true low-resource languages, annotation projection may not be the right way\
    \ to move forward. On a more positive note, we also uncover the conditions that\

  abstract: Typical relation extraction models are trained on a single corpus annotated
    with a pre-defined relation schema. An individual corpus is often small, and the
    models may often be biased or overfitted to the corpus. We hypothesize that we
    can learn a better representation by combining multiple relation datasets. We
    attempt to use a shared encoder to learn the unified feature representation and
    to augment it with regularization by adversarial training. The additional corpora
    feeding the encoder can help to learn a better feature representation layer even
    though the relation schemas are different. We use ACE05 and ERE datasets as our
    case study for experiments. The multi-task model obtains significant improvement
    on both datasets.

  abstract: While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used for text classification,
    they demonstrate poor performance and slow convergence when trained on long sequences.
    When text is modeled as characters instead of words, the longer sequences make
    RNNs a poor choice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), although somewhat less
    ubiquitous than RNNs, have an internal structure more appropriate for long-distance
    character dependencies. To better understand how CNNs and RNNs differ in handling
    long sequences, we use them for text classification tasks in several character-level
    social media datasets. The CNN models vastly outperform the RNN models in our
    experiments, suggesting that CNNs are superior to RNNs at learning to classify
    character-level data.

  abstract: "In a recipe sharing service, users publish recipe instructions in the\

  abstract: Predicting context-dependent and non-literal utterances like sarcastic
    and ironic expressions still remains a challenging task in NLP, as it goes beyond
    linguistic patterns, encompassing common sense and shared knowledge as crucial
    components. To capture complex morpho-syntactic features that can usually serve
    as indicators for irony or sarcasm across dynamic contexts, we propose a model
    that uses character-level vector representations of words, based on ELMo. We test
    our model on 7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources, providing
    state-of-the-art performance in 6 of them, and otherwise offering competitive
    results.

  abstract: In multi-sense word embeddings, contextual variations in corpus may cause
    a univocal word to be embedded into different sense vectors. Shi et al. (2016)
    show that this kind of pseudo multi-senses can be eliminated by linear transformations.
    In this paper, we show that pseudo multi-senses may come from a uniform and meaningful
    phenomenon such as subjective and sentimental usage, though they are seemingly
    redundant. In this paper, we present an unsupervised algorithm to find a linear
    transformation which can minimize the transformed distance of a group of sense
    pairs. The major shrinking direction of this transformation is found to be related
    with subjective shift. Therefore, we can not only eliminate pseudo multi-senses
    in multisense embeddings, but also identify these subjective senses and tag the
    subjective and sentimental usage of words in the corpus automatically.

  abstract: "Data annotation is a critical step to train a text model but it is tedious,\
    \ expensive and time-consuming. We present a language independent method to train\
    \ a sentiment polarity model with limited amount of manually-labeled data. Word\
    \ embeddings such as Word2Vec are efficient at incorporating semantic and syntactic\
    \ properties of words, yielding good results for document classification. However,\
    \ these embeddings might map words with opposite polarities, to vectors close\
    \ to each other. We train Sentiment Specific Word Embeddings (SSWE) on top of\
    \ an unsupervised Word2Vec model, using either Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\
    \ or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on data auto-labeled as \u201CPositive\u201D\
    \ or \u201CNegative\u201D. For this task, we rely on the universality of emojis\
    \ and emoticons to auto-label a large number of French tweets using a small set\
    \ of positive and negative emojis and emoticons. Finally, we apply a transfer\
    \ learning approach to refine the network weights with a small-size manually-labeled\
    \ training data set. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of\
    \ this approach on French sentiment classification using benchmark data sets from\
    \ SemEval 2016 competition. We were able to achieve a performance improvement\
    \ by using SSWE over Word2Vec. We also used a graph-based approach for label propagation\
    \ to auto-generate a sentiment lexicon."

  abstract: This paper introduces a gamified framework for fine-grained sentiment
    analysis and emotion detection. We present a flexible tool, Sentimentator, that
    can be used for efficient annotation based on crowd sourcing and a self-perpetuating
    gold standard. We also present a novel dataset with multi-dimensional annotations
    of emotions and sentiments in movie subtitles that enables research on sentiment
    preservation across languages and the creation of robust multilingual emotion
    detection tools. The tools and datasets are public and open-source and can easily
    be extended and applied for various purposes.

  abstract: "Past shared tasks on emotions use data with both overt expressions of\
    \ emotions (I am so happy to see you!) as well as subtle expressions where the\
    \ emotions have to be inferred, for instance from event descriptions. Further,\
    \ most datasets do not focus on the cause or the stimulus of the emotion. Here,\
    \ for the first time, we propose a shared task where systems have to predict the\
    \ emotions in a large automatically labeled dataset of tweets without access to\
    \ words denoting emotions. Based on this intention, we call this the Implicit\
    \ Emotion Shared Task (IEST) because the systems have to infer the emotion mostly\
    \ from the context. Every tweet has an occurrence of an explicit emotion word\
    \ that is masked. The tweets are collected in a manner such that they are likely\
    \ to include a description of the cause of the emotion \u2013 the stimulus. Altogether,\
    \ 30 teams submitted results which range from macro F1 scores of 21 % to 71 %.\
    \ The baseline (Max-Ent bag of words and bigrams) obtains an F1 score of 60 %\
    \ which was available to the participants during the development phase. A study\
    \ with human annotators suggests that automatic methods outperform human predictions,\
    \ possibly by honing into subtle textual clues not used by humans. Corpora, resources,\
    \ and results are available at the shared task website at http://implicitemotions.wassa2018.com."

  abstract: In this paper we describe our system designed for the WASSA 2018 Implicit
    Emotion Shared Task (IEST), which obtained 2nd place out of 30 teams with a test
    macro F1 score of 0.710. The system is composed of a single pre-trained ELMo layer
    for encoding words, a Bidirectional Long-Short Memory Network BiLSTM for enriching
    word representations with context, a max-pooling operation for creating sentence
    representations from them, and a Dense Layer for projecting the sentence representations
    into label space. Our official submission was obtained by ensembling 6 of these
    models initialized with different random seeds. The code for replicating this
    paper is available at https://github.com/jabalazs/implicit_emotion.

  abstract: In this paper we present our approach to tackle the Implicit Emotion Shared
    Task (IEST) organized as part of WASSA 2018 at EMNLP 2018. Given a tweet, from
    which a certain word has been removed, we are asked to predict the emotion of
    the missing word. In this work, we experiment with neural Transfer Learning (TL)
    methods. Our models are based on LSTM networks, augmented with a self-attention
    mechanism. We use the weights of various pretrained models, for initializing specific
    layers of our networks. We leverage a big collection of unlabeled Twitter messages,
    for pretraining word2vec word embeddings and a set of diverse language models.
    Moreover, we utilize a sentiment analysis dataset for pretraining a model, which
    encodes emotion related information. The submitted model consists of an ensemble
    of the aforementioned TL models. Our team ranked 3rd out of 30 participants, achieving
    an F1 score of 0.703.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis models often rely on training data that is several
    years old. In this paper, we show that lexical features change polarity over time,
    leading to degrading performance. This effect is particularly strong in sparse
    models relying only on highly predictive features. Using predictive feature selection,
    we are able to significantly improve the accuracy of such models over time.

  abstract: Ideological leanings of an individual can often be gauged by the sentiment
    one expresses about different issues. We propose a simple framework that represents
    a political ideology as a distribution of sentiment polarities towards a set of
    topics. This representation can then be used to detect ideological leanings of
    documents (speeches, news articles, etc.) based on the sentiments expressed towards
    different topics. Experiments performed using a widely used dataset show the promise
    of our proposed approach that achieves comparable performance to other methods
    despite being much simpler and more interpretable.

  abstract: In this work, we have analyzed the effects of negation on the semantic
    orientation in Basque. The analysis shows that negation markers can strengthen,
    weaken or have no effect on sentiment orientation of a word or a group of words.
    Using the Constraint Grammar formalism, we have designed and evaluated a set of
    linguistic rules to formalize these three phenomena. The results show that two
    phenomena, strengthening and no change, have been identified accurately and the
    third one, weakening, with acceptable results.

  abstract: Social media text written in Chinese communities contains mixed scripts
    including major text written in Chinese, an ideograph-based writing system, and
    some minor text using Latin letters, an alphabet-based writing system. This phenomenon
    is called writing systems changes (WSCs). Past studies have shown that WSCs can
    be used to express emotions, particularly where the social and political environment
    is more conservative. However, because WSCs can break the syntax of the major
    text, it poses more challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like
    emotion classification. In this work, we present a novel deep learning based method
    to include WSCs as an effective feature for emotion analysis. The method first
    identifies all WSCs points. Then representation of the major text is learned through
    an LSTM model whereas the minor text is learned by a separate CNN model. Emotions
    in the minor text are further highlighted through an attention mechanism before
    emotion classification. Performance evaluation shows that incorporating WSCs features
    using deep learning models can improve performance measured by F1-scores compared
    to the state-of-the-art model.

  abstract: The paper proposes the Ternary Sentiment Embedding Model, a new model
    for creating sentiment embeddings based on the Hybrid Ranking Model of Tang et
    al. (2016), but trained on ternary-labeled data instead of binary-labeled, utilizing
    sentiment embeddings from datasets made with different distant supervision methods.
    The model is used as part of a complete Twitter Sentiment Analysis system and
    empirically compared to existing systems, showing that it outperforms Hybrid Ranking
    and that the quality of the distant-supervised dataset has a great impact on the
    quality of the produced sentiment embeddings.

  abstract: "Social media\u2019s popularity in society and research is gaining momentum\
    \ and simultaneously increasing the importance of short textual content such as\
    \ microblogs. Microblogs are affected by many factors including the news media,\
    \ therefore, we exploit sentiments conveyed from news to detect and classify sentiment\
    \ in microblogs. Given that texts can deal with the same entity but might not\
    \ be vastly related when it comes to sentiment, it becomes necessary to introduce\
    \ further measures ensuring the relatedness of texts while leveraging the contained\

    (ABSA) systems trained on a widely used dataset on actual data. We created a new
    manually annotated dataset of user generated data from the same domain as the
    training dataset, but from other sources and analyse the differences between the

  abstract: We explore the hypothesis that emotion is one of the dimensions of language
    that surfaces from the native language into a second language. To check the role
    of emotions in native language identification (NLI), we model emotion information
    through polarity and emotion load features, and use document representations using
    these features to classify the native language of the author. The results indicate
    that emotion is relevant for NLI, even for high proficiency levels and across
    topics.

  abstract: Sentiment Analysis has seen much progress in the past two decades. For
    the past few years, neural network approaches, primarily RNNs and CNNs, have been
    the most successful for this task. Recently, a new category of neural networks,
    self-attention networks (SANs), have been created which utilizes the attention
    mechanism as the basic building block. Self-attention networks have been shown
    to be effective for sequence modeling tasks, while having no recurrence or convolutions.
    In this work we explore the effectiveness of the SANs for sentiment analysis.
    We demonstrate that SANs are superior in performance to their RNN and CNN counterparts
    by comparing their classification accuracy on six datasets as well as their model
    characteristics such as training speed and memory consumption. Finally, we explore
    the effects of various SAN modifications such as multi-head attention as well
    as two methods of incorporating sequence position information into SANs.

  abstract: In sentiment analysis (SA) of product reviews, both user and product information
    are proven to be useful. Current tasks handle user profile and product information
    in a unified model which may not be able to learn salient features of users and
    products effectively. In this work, we propose a dual user and product memory
    network (DUPMN) model to learn user profiles and product reviews using separate
    memory networks. Then, the two representations are used jointly for sentiment
    prediction. The use of separate models aims to capture user profiles and product
    information more effectively. Compared to state-of-the-art unified prediction
    models, the evaluations on three benchmark datasets, IMDB, Yelp13, and Yelp14,
    show that our dual learning model gives performance gain of 0.6%, 1.2%, and 0.9%,
    respectively. The improvements are also deemed very significant measured by p-values.

  abstract: "Sentiment and topic analysis are common methods used for social media\
    \ monitoring. Essentially, these methods answers questions such as, \u201Cwhat\
    \ is being talked about, regarding X\u201D, and \u201Cwhat do people feel, regarding\
    \ X\u201D. In this paper, we investigate another venue for social media monitoring,\
    \ namely issue ownership and agenda setting, which are concepts from political\
    \ science that have been used to explain voter choice and electoral outcomes.\
    \ We argue that issue alignment and agenda setting can be seen as a kind of semantic\
    \ source similarity of the kind \u201Chow similar is source A to issue owner P,\
    \ when talking about issue X\u201D, and as such can be measured using word/document\
    \ embedding techniques. We present work in progress towards measuring that kind\
    \ of conditioned similarity, and introduce a new notion of similarity for predictive\
    \ embeddings. We then test this method by measuring the similarity between politically\
    \ aligned media and political parties, conditioned on bloc-specific issues."

  abstract: The increasing suicide rates amongst youth and its high correlation with
    suicidal ideation expression on social media warrants a deeper investigation into
    models for the detection of suicidal intent in text such as tweets to enable prevention.
    However, the complexity of the natural language constructs makes this task very
    challenging. Deep Learning architectures such as LSTMs, CNNs, and RNNs show promise
    in sentence level classification problems. This work investigates the ability
    of deep learning architectures to build an accurate and robust model for suicidal
    ideation detection and compares their performance with standard baselines in text
    classification problems. The experimental results reveal the merit in C-LSTM based
    models as compared to other deep learning and machine learning based classification
    models for suicidal ideation detection.

  abstract: This paper describes the approaches used in HUMIR system for the WASSA-2018
    shared task on the implicit emotion recognition. The objective of this task is
    to predict the emotion expressed by the target word that has been excluded from
    the given tweet. We suppose this task as a word sense disambiguation in which
    the target word is considered as a synthetic word that can express 6 emotions
    depending on the context. To predict the correct emotion, we propose a deep neural
    network model that uses two BiLSTM networks to represent the contexts in the left
    and right sides of the target word. The BiLSTM outputs achieved from the left
    and right contexts are considered as context-sensitive features. These features
    are used in a feed-forward neural network to predict the target word emotion.
    Besides this approach, we also combine the BiLSTM model with lexicon-based and
    emotion-based features. Finally, we employ all models in the final system using
    Bagging ensemble method. We achieved macro F-measure value of 68.8 on the official
    test set and ranked sixth out of 30 participants.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our method that competed at WASSA2018 Implicit Emotion
    Shared Task. The goal of this task is to classify the emotions of excluded words
    in tweets into six different classes: sad, joy, disgust, surprise, anger and fear.
    For this, we examine a BiLSTM architecture with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention)
    and a LSTM architecture with attention mechanism (LSTM-Attention), and try different
    dropout rates based on these two models. We then exploit an ensemble of these
    methods to give the final prediction which improves the model performance significantly
    compared with the baseline model. The proposed method achieves 7th position out
    of 30 teams and outperforms the baseline method by 12.5% in terms of macro F1.'

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our participation in WASSA 2018 Implicit Emotion
    Shared Task (IEST 2018). We claim that the use of emotional external knowledge
    may enhance the performance and the capacity of generalization of an emotion classification
    system based on neural networks. Accordingly, we submitted four deep learning
    systems grounded in a sequence encoding layer. They mainly differ in the feature
    vector space and the recurrent neural network used in the sequence encoding layer.
    The official results show that the systems that used emotional external knowledge
    have a higher capacity of generalization, hence our claim holds.

    Boosting Regression Tree Method (GBM). Word embeddings used in convolutional BLSTM
    are pre-trained on 470 million tweets which are filtered using the emotional words

    features, cluster features) are adopted to train GBM and FFNN. The three approaches

    with the use of pre-trained word embedding models to train multiple neural networks.
    The system described in this paper is composed of a sequential combination of
    Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction
    and Feedforward Neural Network for classification. In this paper, we successfully
    show that features extracted using multiple pre-trained embeddings can be used
    to improve the overall performance of the system with Emoji being one of the significant
    features. The evaluations show that our approach outperforms the baseline system
    by more than 8% without using any external corpus or lexicon. This approach is
    ranked 8th in Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST) at WASSA-2018.

    parts of the task. We focused on handling emojis, emoticons, hashtags, and also
    various shortened word forms. In some cases, we proposed to remove some parts
    of the text, as they do not affect emotion of the original sentence. We also experimented
    with other modifications like category weights for learning and stacking multiple

    emotion prediction of tweets. We show that the dataset is linearly separable and
    explore ways in fine-tuning the baseline classifier. Our results indicate that
    the bag-of-words features benefit the model moderately and prediction can be improved
    with bigrams, trigrams, skip-one-tetragrams and POS-tags. Furthermore, we find
    preprocessing of the n-grams, including stemming, lowercasing, stopword filtering,
    emoji and emoticon conversion generally not useful. The model is trained on an
    annotated corpus of 153,383 tweets and predictions on the test data were submitted
    to the WASSA-2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task. BrainT attained a Macro F-score
    of 0.63.

    fear, disgust, joy, sad, and surprise) have been removed from the tweet text,
    making emotion prediction implicit and the task challenging. We propose a model
    based on an ensemble of classifiers for prediction. Each classifier uses a sequence
    of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture blocks and uses ELMo (Embeddings
    from Language Model) as an input. Our system achieves a 66.2% F1 score on the
    test set. The best performing system in the shared task has reported a 71.4% F1
    score.

  abstract: In this paper, we present the system we have used for the Implicit WASSA
    2018 Implicit Emotion Shared Task. The task is to predict the emotion of a tweet
    of which the explicit mentions of emotion terms have been removed. The idea is
    to come up with a model which has the ability to implicitly identify the emotion
    expressed given the context words. We have used a Gated Recurrent Neural Network
    (GRU) and a Capsule Network based model for the task. Pre-trained word embeddings
    have been utilized to incorporate contextual knowledge about words into the model.
    GRU layer learns latent representations using the input word embeddings. Subsequent
    Capsule Network layer learns high-level features from that hidden representation.
    The proposed model managed to achieve a macro-F1 score of 0.692.

    \ and the inability of the existing systems to accurately predict the sentiments\

  abstract: Detecting stress from social media gives a non-intrusive and inexpensive
    alternative to traditional tools such as questionnaires or physiological sensors
    for monitoring mental state of individuals. This paper introduces a novel framework
    for finding reasons for stress from tweets, analyzing multiple categories for
    the first time. Three word-vector based methods are evaluated on collections of
    tweets about politics or airlines and are found to be more accurate than standard
    machine learning algorithms.

  abstract: Generative models have recently experienced a surge in popularity due
    to the development of more efficient training algorithms and increasing computational
    power. Models such as adversarial generative networks (GANs) have been successfully
    used in various areas such as computer vision, medical imaging, style transfer
    and natural language generation. Adversarial nets were recently shown to yield
    results in the image-to-text task, where given a set of images, one has to provide
    their corresponding text description. In this paper, we take a similar approach
    and propose a image-to-emoji architecture, which is trained on data from social
    networks and can be used to score a given picture using ideograms. We show empirical
    results of our algorithm on data obtained from the most influential Instagram
    accounts.

  abstract: "Analysis of the topics mentioned and opinions expressed in parliamentary\
    \ debate motions\u2013or proposals\u2013is difficult for human readers, but necessary\
    \ for understanding and automatic processing of the content of the subsequent\
    \ speeches. We present a dataset of debate motions with pre-existing \u2018policy\u2019\
    \ labels, and investigate the utility of these labels for simultaneous topic and\
    \ opinion polarity analysis. For topic detection, we apply one-versus-the-rest\
    \ supervised topic classification, finding that good performance is achieved in\
    \ predicting the policy topics, and that textual features derived from the debate\
    \ titles associated with the motions are particularly indicative of motion topic.\
    \ We then examine whether the output could also be used to determine the positions\
    \ taken by proposers towards the different policies by investigating how well\
    \ humans agree in interpreting the opinion polarities of the motions. Finding\
    \ very high levels of agreement, we conclude that the policies used can be reliable\
    \ labels for use in these tasks, and that successful topic detection can therefore\
    \ provide opinion analysis of the motions \u2018for free\u2019."

  abstract: In this paper, automatic homophone- and homograph detection are suggested
    as new useful features for humor recognition systems. The system combines style-features
    from previous studies on humor recognition in short text with ambiguity-based
    features. The performance of two potentially useful homograph detection methods
    is evaluated using crowdsourced annotations as ground truth. Adding homophones
    and homographs as features to the classifier results in a small but significant
    improvement over the style-features alone. For the task of humor recognition,
    recall appears to be a more important quality measure than precision. Although
    the system was designed for humor recognition in oneliners, it also performs well
    at the classification of longer humorous texts.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose Emo2Vec which encodes emotional semantics into
    vectors. We train Emo2Vec by multi-task learning six different emotion-related
    tasks, including emotion/sentiment analysis, sarcasm classification, stress detection,
    abusive language classification, insult detection, and personality recognition.
    Our evaluation of Emo2Vec shows that it outperforms existing affect-related representations,
    such as Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding and DeepMoji embeddings with much smaller
    training corpora. When concatenated with GloVe, Emo2Vec achieves competitive performances
    to state-of-the-art results on several tasks using a simple logistic regression
    classifier.

  abstract: We propose a method named Super Characters for sentiment classification.
    This method converts the sentiment classification problem into image classification
    problem by projecting texts into images and then applying CNN models for classification.
    Text features are extracted automatically from the generated Super Characters
    images, hence there is no need of any explicit step of embedding the words or
    characters into numerical vector representations. Experimental results on large
    social media corpus show that the Super Characters method consistently outperforms
    other methods for sentiment classification and topic classification tasks on ten
    large social media datasets of millions of contents in four different languages,
    including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and English.

  abstract: "Automatic hirability prediction from video resumes is gaining increasing\
    \ attention in both psychology and computing. Most existing works have investigated\
    \ hirability from the perspective of nonverbal behavior, with verbal content receiving\
    \ little interest. In this study, we leverage the advances in deep-learning based\
    \ text representation techniques (like word embedding) in natural language processing\
    \ to investigate the relationship between verbal content and perceived hirability\
    \ ratings. To this end, we use 292 conversational video resumes from YouTube,\
    \ develop a computational framework to automatically extract various representations\
    \ of verbal content, and evaluate them in a regression task. We obtain a best\
    \ performance of R\xB2 = 0.23 using GloVe, and R\xB2 = 0.22 using Word2Vec representations\
    \ for manual and automatically transcribed texts respectively. Our inference results\
    \ indicate the feasibility of using deep learning based verbal content representation\
    \ in inferring hirability scores from online conversational video resumes."

  abstract: "We aim to predict Flemish adolescents\u2019 educational track based on\
    \ their Dutch social media writing. We distinguish between the three main types\
    \ of Belgian secondary education: General (theory-oriented), Vocational (practice-oriented),\
    \ and Technical Secondary Education (hybrid). The best results are obtained with\
    \ a Naive Bayes model, i.e. an F-score of 0.68 (std. dev. 0.05) in 10-fold cross-validation\
    \ experiments on the training data and an F-score of 0.60 on unseen data. Many\
    \ of the most informative features are character n-grams containing specific occurrences\
    \ of chatspeak phenomena such as emoticons. While the detection of the most theory-\
    \ and practice-oriented educational tracks seems to be a relatively easy task,\
    \ the hybrid Technical level appears to be much harder to capture based on online\
    \ writing style, as expected."

  abstract: Arabizi is a form of writing Arabic text which relies on Latin letters,
    numerals and punctuation rather than Arabic letters. In the literature, the difficulties
    associated with Arabizi sentiment analysis have been underestimated, principally
    due to the complexity of Arabizi. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically
    classify sentiments of Arabizi messages into positives or negatives. In the proposed
    approach, Arabizi messages are first transliterated into Arabic. Afterwards, we
    automatically classify the sentiment of the transliterated corpus using an automatically
    annotated corpus. For corpus validation, shallow machine learning algorithms such
    as Support Vectors Machine (SVM) and Naive Bays (NB) are used. Simulations results
    demonstrate the outperformance of NB algorithm over all others. The highest achieved
    F1-score is up to 78% and 76% for manually and automatically transliterated dataset
    respectively. Ongoing work is aimed at improving the transliterator module and
    annotated sentiment dataset.

  abstract: We describe UBC-NLP contribution to IEST-2018, focused at learning implicit
    emotion in Twitter data. Among the 30 participating teams, our system ranked the
    4th (with 69.3% F-score). Post competition, we were able to score slightly higher
    than the 3rd ranking system (reaching 70.7%). Our system is trained on top of
    a pre-trained language model (LM), fine-tuned on the data provided by the task
    organizers. Our best results are acquired by an average of an ensemble of language
    models. We also offer an analysis of system performance and the impact of training
    data size on the task. For example, we show that training our best model for only
    one epoch with < 40% of the data enables better performance than the baseline
    reported by Klinger et al. (2018) for the task.

    \ On WMT\u201914 English-German translation, we match the accuracy of Vaswani\
    \ et al. (2017) in under 5 hours when training on 8 GPUs and we obtain a new state\
    \ of the art of 29.3 BLEU after training for 85 minutes on 128 GPUs. We further\
    \ improve these results to 29.8 BLEU by training on the much larger Paracrawl\

  abstract: Character-level Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have recently
    achieved impressive results on many language pairs. They mainly do well for Indo-European
    language pairs, where the languages share the same writing system. However, for
    translating between Chinese and English, the gap between the two different writing
    systems poses a major challenge because of a lack of systematic correspondence
    between the individual linguistic units. In this paper, we enable character-level
    NMT for Chinese, by breaking down Chinese characters into linguistic units similar
    to that of Indo-European languages. We use the Wubi encoding scheme, which preserves
    the original shape and semantic information of the characters, while also being
    reversible. We show promising results from training Wubi-based models on the character-
    and subword-level with recurrent as well as convolutional models.

  abstract: Recent neural machine translation (NMT) systems have been greatly improved
    by encoder-decoder models with attention mechanisms and sub-word units. However,
    important differences between languages with logographic and alphabetic writing
    systems have long been overlooked. This study focuses on these differences and
    uses a simple approach to improve the performance of NMT systems utilizing decomposed
    sub-character level information for logographic languages. Our results indicate
    that our approach not only improves the translation capabilities of NMT systems
    between Chinese and English, but also further improves NMT systems between Chinese
    and Japanese, because it utilizes the shared information brought by similar sub-character
    units.

  abstract: "Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in\
    \ neural machine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\
    \ machine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder attention\
    \ mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT models. We\
    \ hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context tokens when\
    \ translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution patterns\
    \ when translating ambiguous nouns. Counterintuitively, we find that attention\
    \ mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous noun itself\
    \ rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We conclude that attention\
    \ is not the main mechanism used by NMT models to incorporate contextual information\
    \ for WSD. The experimental results suggest that NMT models learn to encode contextual\
    \ information necessary for WSD in the encoder hidden states. For the attention\
    \ mechanism in Transformer models, we reveal that the first few layers gradually\
    \ learn to \u201Calign\u201D source and target tokens and the last few layers\
    \ learn to extract features from the related but unaligned context tokens."

  abstract: We present an analysis of a number of coreference phenomena in English-Croatian
    human and machine translations. The aim is to shed light on the differences in
    the way these structurally different languages make use of discourse information
    and provide insights for discourse-aware machine translation system development.
    The phenomena are automatically identified in parallel data using annotation produced
    by parsers and word alignment tools, enabling us to pinpoint patterns of interest
    in both languages. We make the analysis more fine-grained by including three corpora
    pertaining to three different registers. In a second step, we create a test set
    with the challenging linguistic constructions and use it to evaluate the performance
    of three MT systems. We show that both SMT and NMT systems struggle with handling
    these discourse phenomena, even though NMT tends to perform somewhat better than
    SMT. By providing an overview of patterns frequently occurring in actual language
    use, as well as by pointing out the weaknesses of current MT systems that commonly
    mistranslate them, we hope to contribute to the effort of resolving the issue
    of discourse phenomena in MT applications.

  abstract: Cross-sentence context can provide valuable information in Machine Translation
    and is critical for translation of anaphoric pronouns and for providing consistent
    translations. In this paper, we devise simple oracle experiments targeting coreference
    and coherence. Oracles are an easy way to evaluate the effect of different discourse-level
    phenomena in NMT using BLEU and eliminate the necessity to manually define challenge
    sets for this purpose. We propose two context-aware NMT models and compare them
    against models working on a concatenation of consecutive sentences. Concatenation
    models perform better, but are computationally expensive. We show that NMT models
    taking advantage of context oracle signals can achieve considerable gains in BLEU,
    of up to 7.02 BLEU for coreference and 1.89 BLEU for coherence on subtitles translation.
    Access to strong signals allows us to make clear comparisons between context-aware
    models.

  abstract: The translation of pronouns presents a special challenge to machine translation
    to this day, since it often requires context outside the current sentence. Recent
    work on models that have access to information across sentence boundaries has
    seen only moderate improvements in terms of automatic evaluation metrics such
    as BLEU. However, metrics that quantify the overall translation quality are ill-equipped
    to measure gains from additional context. We argue that a different kind of evaluation
    is needed to assess how well models translate inter-sentential phenomena such
    as pronouns. This paper therefore presents a test suite of contrastive translations
    focused specifically on the translation of pronouns. Furthermore, we perform experiments
    with several context-aware models. We show that, while gains in BLEU are moderate
    for those systems, they outperform baselines by a large margin in terms of accuracy
    on our contrastive test set. Our experiments also show the effectiveness of parameter
    tying for multi-encoder architectures.

  abstract: Tying the weights of the target word embeddings with the target word classifiers
    of neural machine translation models leads to faster training and often to better
    translation quality. Given the success of this parameter sharing, we investigate
    other forms of sharing in between no sharing and hard equality of parameters.
    In particular, we propose a structure-aware output layer which captures the semantic
    structure of the output space of words within a joint input-output embedding.
    The model is a generalized form of weight tying which shares parameters but allows
    learning a more flexible relationship with input word embeddings and allows the
    effective capacity of the output layer to be controlled. In addition, the model
    shares weights across output classifiers and translation contexts which allows
    it to better leverage prior knowledge about them. Our evaluation on English-to-Finnish
    and English-to-German datasets shows the effectiveness of the method against strong
    encoder-decoder baselines trained with or without weight tying.

  abstract: We incorporate an explicit neural interlingua into a multilingual encoder-decoder
    neural machine translation (NMT) architecture. We demonstrate that our model learns
    a language-independent representation by performing direct zero-shot translation
    (without using pivot translation), and by using the source sentence embeddings
    to create an English Yelp review classifier that, through the mediation of the
    neural interlingua, can also classify French and German reviews. Furthermore,
    we show that, despite using a smaller number of parameters than a pairwise collection
    of bilingual NMT models, our approach produces comparable BLEU scores for each
    language pair in WMT15.

  abstract: 'Embedding and projection matrices are commonly used in neural language
    models (NLM) as well as in other sequence processing networks that operate on
    large vocabularies. We examine such matrices in fine-tuned language models and
    observe that a NLM learns word vectors whose norms are related to the word frequencies.
    We show that by initializing the weight norms with scaled log word counts, together
    with other techniques, lower perplexities can be obtained in early epochs of training.
    We also introduce a weight norm regularization loss term, whose hyperparameters
    are tuned via a grid search. With this method, we are able to significantly improve
    perplexities on two word-level language modeling tasks (without dynamic evaluation):
    from 54.44 to 53.16 on Penn Treebank (PTB) and from 61.45 to 60.13 on WikiText-2
    (WT2).'

  abstract: Recent works in neural machine translation have begun to explore document
    translation. However, translating online multi-speaker conversations is still
    an open problem. In this work, we propose the task of translating Bilingual Multi-Speaker
    Conversations, and explore neural architectures which exploit both source and
    target-side conversation histories for this task. To initiate an evaluation for
    this task, we introduce datasets extracted from Europarl v7 and OpenSubtitles2016.
    Our experiments on four language-pairs confirm the significance of leveraging
    conversation history, both in terms of BLEU and manual evaluation.

  abstract: 'We reassess a recent study (Hassan et al., 2018) that claimed that machine
    translation (MT) has reached human parity for the translation of news from Chinese
    into English, using pairwise ranking and considering three variables that were
    not taken into account in that previous study: the language in which the source
    side of the test set was originally written, the translation proficiency of the
    evaluators, and the provision of inter-sentential context. If we consider only
    original source text (i.e. not translated from another language, or translationese),
    then we find evidence showing that human parity has not been achieved. We compare
    the judgments of professional translators against those of non-experts and discover
    that those of the experts result in higher inter-annotator agreement and better
    discrimination between human and machine translations. In addition, we analyse
    the human translations of the test set and identify important translation issues.
    Finally, based on these findings, we provide a set of recommendations for future
    human evaluations of MT.'

  abstract: Measuring domain relevance of data and identifying or selecting well-fit
    domain data for machine translation (MT) is a well-studied topic, but denoising
    is not yet. Denoising is concerned with a different type of data quality and tries
    to reduce the negative impact of data noise on MT training, in particular, neural
    MT (NMT) training. This paper generalizes methods for measuring and selecting
    data for domain MT and applies them to denoising NMT training. The proposed approach
    uses trusted data and a denoising curriculum realized by online data selection.
    Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of the approach show its significant effectiveness
    for NMT to train on data with severe noise.

  abstract: Neural Machine Translation (MT) has radically changed the way systems
    are developed. A major difference with the previous generation (Phrase-Based MT)
    is the way monolingual target data, which often abounds, is used in these two
    paradigms. While Phrase-Based MT can seamlessly integrate very large language
    models trained on billions of sentences, the best option for Neural MT developers
    seems to be the generation of artificial parallel data through back-translation
    - a technique that fails to fully take advantage of existing datasets. In this
    paper, we conduct a systematic study of back-translation, comparing alternative
    uses of monolingual data, as well as multiple data generation procedures. Our
    findings confirm that back-translation is very effective and give new explanations
    as to why this is the case. We also introduce new data simulation techniques that
    are almost as effective, yet much cheaper to implement.

  abstract: Both research and commercial machine translation have so far neglected
    the importance of properly handling the spelling, lexical and grammar divergences
    occurring among language varieties. Notable cases are standard national varieties
    such as Brazilian and European Portuguese, and Canadian and European French, which
    popular online machine translation services are not keeping distinct. We show
    that an evident side effect of modeling such varieties as unique classes is the
    generation of inconsistent translations. In this work, we investigate the problem
    of training neural machine translation from English to specific pairs of language
    varieties, assuming both labeled and unlabeled parallel texts, and low-resource
    conditions. We report experiments from English to two pairs of dialects, European-Brazilian
    Portuguese and European-Canadian French, and two pairs of standardized varieties,
    Croatian-Serbian and Indonesian-Malay. We show significant BLEU score improvements
    over baseline systems when translation into similar languages is learned as a
    multilingual task with shared representations.

  abstract: This paper presents an effective approach for parallel corpus mining using
    bilingual sentence embeddings. Our embedding models are trained to produce similar
    representations exclusively for bilingual sentence pairs that are translations
    of each other. This is achieved using a novel training method that introduces
    hard negatives consisting of sentences that are not translations but have some
    degree of semantic similarity. The quality of the resulting embeddings are evaluated
    on parallel corpus reconstruction and by assessing machine translation systems
    trained on gold vs. mined sentence pairs. We find that the sentence embeddings
    can be used to reconstruct the United Nations Parallel Corpus (Ziemski et al.,
    2016) at the sentence-level with a precision of 48.9% for en-fr and 54.9% for
    en-es. When adapted to document-level matching, we achieve a parallel document
    matching accuracy that is comparable to the significantly more computationally
    intensive approach of Uszkoreit et al. (2010). Using reconstructed parallel data,
    we are able to train NMT models that perform nearly as well as models trained
    on the original data (within 1-2 BLEU).

  abstract: "This work investigates the alignment problem in state-of-the-art multi-head\
    \ attention models based on the transformer architecture. We demonstrate that\
    \ alignment extraction in transformer models can be improved by augmenting an\
    \ additional alignment head to the multi-head source-to-target attention component.\
    \ This is used to compute sharper attention weights. We describe how to use the\
    \ alignment head to achieve competitive performance. To study the effect of adding\
    \ the alignment head, we simulate a dictionary-guided translation task, where\
    \ the user wants to guide translation using pre-defined dictionary entries. Using\
    \ the proposed approach, we achieve up to 3.8% BLEU improvement when using the\
    \ dictionary, in comparison to 2.4% BLEU in the baseline case. We also propose\
    \ alignment pruning to speed up decoding in alignment-based neural machine translation\
    \ (ANMT), which speeds up translation by a factor of 1.8 without loss in translation\
    \ performance. We carry out experiments on the shared WMT 2016 English\u2192Romanian\
    \ news task and the BOLT Chinese\u2192English discussion forum task."

  abstract: "The field of machine translation faces an under-recognized problem because\
    \ of inconsistency in the reporting of scores from its dominant metric. Although\
    \ people refer to \u201Cthe\u201D BLEU score, BLEU is in fact a parameterized\
    \ metric whose values can vary wildly with changes to these parameters. These\
    \ parameters are often not reported or are hard to find, and consequently, BLEU\
    \ scores between papers cannot be directly compared. I quantify this variation,\
    \ finding differences as high as 1.8 between commonly used configurations. The\
    \ main culprit is different tokenization and normalization schemes applied to\
    \ the reference. Pointing to the success of the parsing community, I suggest machine\
    \ translation researchers settle upon the BLEU scheme used by the annual Conference\
    \ on Machine Translation (WMT), which does not allow for user-supplied reference\
    \ processing, and provide a new tool, SACREBLEU, to facilitate this."

  abstract: 'A popular application of machine translation (MT) is gisting: MT is consumed
    as is to make sense of text in a foreign language. Evaluation of the usefulness
    of MT for gisting is surprisingly uncommon. The classical method uses reading
    comprehension questionnaires (RCQ), in which informants are asked to answer professionally-written
    questions in their language about a foreign text that has been machine-translated
    into their language. Recently, gap-filling (GF), a form of cloze testing, has
    been proposed as a cheaper alternative to RCQ. In GF, certain words are removed
    from reference translations and readers are asked to fill the gaps left using
    the machine-translated text as a hint. This paper reports, for the first time,
    a comparative evaluation, using both RCQ and GF, of translations from multiple
    MT systems for the same foreign texts, and a systematic study on the effect of
    variables such as gap density, gap-selection strategies, and document context
    in GF. The main findings of the study are: (a) both RCQ and GF clearly identify
    MT to be useful; (b) global RCQ and GF rankings for the MT systems are mostly
    in agreement; (c) GF scores vary very widely across informants, making comparisons
    among MT systems hard, and (d) unlike RCQ, which is framed around documents, GF
    evaluation can be framed at the sentence level. These findings support the use
    of GF as a cheaper alternative to RCQ.'

  abstract: 'Neural Machine Translation (NMT) typically leverages monolingual data
    in training through backtranslation. We investigate an alternative simple method
    to use monolingual data for NMT training: We combine the scores of a pre-trained
    and fixed language model (LM) with the scores of a translation model (TM) while
    the TM is trained from scratch. To achieve that, we train the translation model
    to predict the residual probability of the training data added to the prediction
    of the LM. This enables the TM to focus its capacity on modeling the source sentence
    since it can rely on the LM for fluency. We show that our method outperforms previous
    approaches to integrate LMs into NMT while the architecture is simpler as it does
    not require gating networks to balance TM and LM. We observe gains of between
    +0.24 and +2.36 BLEU on all four test sets (English-Turkish, Turkish-English,
    Estonian-English, Xhosa-English) on top of ensembles without LM. We compare our
    method with alternative ways to utilize monolingual data such as backtranslation,
    shallow fusion, and cold fusion.'

  abstract: We study two problems in neural machine translation (NMT). First, in beam
    search, whereas a wider beam should in principle help translation, it often hurts
    NMT. Second, NMT has a tendency to produce translations that are too short. Here,
    we argue that these problems are closely related and both rooted in label bias.
    We show that correcting the brevity problem almost eliminates the beam problem;
    we compare some commonly-used methods for doing this, finding that a simple per-word
    reward works well; and we introduce a simple and quick way to tune this reward
    using the perceptron algorithm.

  abstract: "Data selection is a process used in selecting a subset of parallel data\
    \ for the training of machine translation (MT) systems, so that 1) resources for\
    \ training might be reduced, 2) trained models could perform better than those\
    \ trained with the whole corpus, and/or 3) trained models are more tailored to\
    \ specific domains. It has been shown that for statistical MT (SMT), the use of\
    \ data selection helps improve the MT performance significantly. In this study,\
    \ we reviewed three data selection approaches for MT, namely Term Frequency\u2013\
    \ Inverse Document Frequency, Cross-Entropy Difference and Feature Decay Algorithm,\
    \ and conducted experiments on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with the selected\
    \ data using the three approaches. The results showed that for NMT systems, using\
    \ data selection also improved the performance, though the gain is not as much\
    \ as for SMT systems."

  abstract: We work on translation from rich-resource languages to low-resource languages.
    The main challenges we identify are the lack of low-resource language data, effective
    methods for cross-lingual transfer, and the variable-binding problem that is common
    in neural systems. We build a translation system that addresses these challenges
    using eight European language families as our test ground. Firstly, we add the
    source and the target family labels and study intra-family and inter-family influences
    for effective cross-lingual transfer. We achieve an improvement of +9.9 in BLEU
    score for English-Swedish translation using eight families compared to the single-family
    multi-source multi-target baseline. Moreover, we find that training on two neighboring
    families closest to the low-resource language is often enough. Secondly, we construct
    an ablation study and find that reasonably good results can be achieved even with
    considerably less target data. Thirdly, we address the variable-binding problem
    by building an order-preserving named entity translation model. We obtain 60.6%
    accuracy in qualitative evaluation where our translations are akin to human translations
    in a preliminary study.

  abstract: 'In multi-source sequence-to-sequence tasks, the attention mechanism can
    be modeled in several ways. This topic has been thoroughly studied on recurrent
    architectures. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the encoder-decoder
    attention in the Transformer architecture. We propose four different input combination
    strategies for the encoder-decoder attention: serial, parallel, flat, and hierarchical.
    We evaluate our methods on tasks of multimodal translation and translation with
    multiple source languages. The experiments show that the models are able to use
    multiple sources and improve over single source baselines.'

  abstract: In multilingual neural machine translation, it has been shown that sharing
    a single translation model between multiple languages can achieve competitive
    performance, sometimes even leading to performance gains over bilingually trained
    models. However, these improvements are not uniform; often multilingual parameter
    sharing results in a decrease in accuracy due to translation models not being
    able to accommodate different languages in their limited parameter space. In this
    work, we examine parameter sharing techniques that strike a happy medium between
    full sharing and individual training, specifically focusing on the self-attentional
    Transformer model. We find that the full parameter sharing approach leads to increases
    in BLEU scores mainly when the target languages are from a similar language family.
    However, even in the case where target languages are from different families where
    full parameter sharing leads to a noticeable drop in BLEU scores, our proposed
    methods for partial sharing of parameters can lead to substantial improvements
    in translation accuracy.

  abstract: This paper presents the results of the premier shared task organized alongside
    the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2018. Participants were asked to build
    machine translation systems for any of 7 language pairs in both directions, to
    be evaluated on a test set of news stories. The main metric for this task is human
    judgment of translation quality. This year, we also opened up the task to additional
    test sets to probe specific aspects of translation.

  abstract: 'We present the results from the third shared task on multimodal machine
    translation. In this task a source sentence in English is supplemented by an image
    and participating systems are required to generate a translation for such a sentence
    into German, French or Czech. The image can be used in addition to (or instead
    of) the source sentence. This year the task was extended with a third target language
    (Czech) and a new test set. In addition, a variant of this task was introduced
    with its own test set where the source sentence is given in multiple languages:
    English, French and German, and participating systems are required to generate
    a translation in Czech. Seven teams submitted 45 different systems to the two
    variants of the task. Compared to last year, the performance of the multimodal
    submissions improved, but text-only systems remain competitive.'

    \ between languages and can facilitate access to information only available in\
    \ a given language for non-speakers of this language, e.g. research results presented\
    \ in scientific publications. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Biomedical\
    \ Translation shared task in the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) 2018, which\
    \ specifically examined the performance of machine translation systems for biomedical\
    \ texts. This year, we provided test sets of scientific publications from two\
    \ sources (EDP and Medline) and for six language pairs (English with each of Chinese,\
    \ French, German, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish). We describe the development\
    \ of the various test sets, the submissions that we received and the evaluations\
    \ that we carried out. We obtained a total of 39 runs from six teams and some\
    \ of this year\u2019s BLEU scores were somewhat higher that last year\u2019s,\
    \ especially for teams that made use of biomedical resources or state-of-the-art\
    \ MT algorithms (e.g. Transformer). Finally, our manual evaluation scored automatic\
    \ translations higher than the reference translations for German and Spanish."

  abstract: We build parallel feature decay algorithms (parfda) Moses statistical
    machine translation (SMT) models for language pairs in the translation task. parfda
    obtains results close to the top constrained phrase-based SMT with an average
    of 2.252 BLEU points difference on WMT 2017 datasets using significantly less
    computation for building SMT systems than that would be spent using all available
    corpora. We obtain BLEU upper bounds based on target coverage to identify which
    systems used additional data. We use PRO for tuning to decrease fluctuations in
    the results and postprocess translation outputs to decrease translation errors
    due to the casing of words. F1 scores on the key phrases of the English to Turkish
    testsuite that we prepared reveal that parfda achieves 2nd best results. Truecasing
    translations before scoring obtained the best results overall.

  abstract: In this article we describe the TALP-UPC research group participation
    in the WMT18 news shared translation task for Finnish-English and Estonian-English
    within the multi-lingual subtrack. All of our primary submissions implement an
    attention-based Neural Machine Translation architecture. Given that Finnish and
    Estonian belong to the same language family and are similar, we use as training
    data the combination of the datasets of both language pairs to paliate the data
    scarceness of each individual pair. We also report the translation quality of
    systems trained on individual language pair data to serve as baseline and comparison
    reference.

    \ We build several baseline translation systems for both directions of the English-Estonian\
    \ language pair using monolingual data only; the systems belong to the phrase-based\
    \ unsupervised machine translation paradigm where we experimented with phrase\
    \ lengths of up to 3. As a main contribution, we performed a set of standalone\
    \ experiments with compositional phrase embeddings as a substitute for phrases\
    \ as individual vocabulary entries. Results show that reasonable n-gram vectors\
    \ can be obtained by simply summing up individual word vectors which retains or\

  abstract: This article describes the Aalto University entry to the WMT18 News Translation
    Shared Task. We participate in the multilingual subtrack with a system trained
    under the constrained condition to translate from English to both Finnish and
    Estonian. The system is based on the Transformer model. We focus on improving
    the consistency of morphological segmentation for words that are similar orthographically,
    semantically, and distributionally; such words include etymological cognates,
    loan words, and proper names. For this, we introduce Cognate Morfessor, a multilingual
    variant of the Morfessor method. We show that our approach improves the translation
    quality particularly for Estonian, which has less resources for training the translation
    model.

    \ Our system follows current best-practice and combines state-of-the-art models\
    \ with new data filtering (dual conditional cross-entropy filtering) and sentence\
    \ weighting methods. We trained fairly standard Transformer-big models with an\
    \ updated version of Edinburgh\u2019s training scheme for WMT2017 and experimented\
    \ with different filtering schemes for Paracrawl. According to automatic metrics\
    \ (BLEU) we reached the highest score for this subtask with a nearly 2 BLEU point\

  abstract: "This paper presents the NICT\u2019s participation to the WMT18 shared\
    \ news translation task. We participated in the eight translation directions of\
    \ four language pairs: Estonian-English, Finnish-English, Turkish-English and\
    \ Chinese-English. For each translation direction, we prepared state-of-the-art\
    \ statistical (SMT) and neural (NMT) machine translation systems. Our NMT systems\
    \ were trained with the transformer architecture using the provided parallel data\
    \ enlarged with a large quantity of back-translated monolingual data that we generated\
    \ with a new incremental training framework. Our primary submissions to the task\
    \ are the result of a simple combination of our SMT and NMT systems. Our systems\
    \ are ranked first for the Estonian-English and Finnish-English language pairs\
    \ (constraint) according to BLEU-cased."

  abstract: We describe our NMT system submitted to the WMT2018 shared task in news
    translation. Our system is based on the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017).
    We use an improved technique of backtranslation, where we iterate the process
    of translating monolingual data in one direction and training an NMT model for
    the opposite direction using synthetic parallel data. We apply a simple but effective
    filtering of the synthetic data. We pre-process the input sentences using coreference
    resolution in order to disambiguate the gender of pro-dropped personal pronouns.
    Finally, we apply two simple post-processing substitutions on the translated output.
    Our system is significantly (p < 0.05) better than all other English-Czech and
    Czech-English systems in WMT2018.

  abstract: The University of Cambridge submission to the WMT18 news translation task
    focuses on the combination of diverse models of translation. We compare recurrent,
    convolutional, and self-attention-based neural models on German-English, English-German,
    and Chinese-English. Our final system combines all neural models together with
    a phrase-based SMT system in an MBR-based scheme. We report small but consistent
    gains on top of strong Transformer ensembles.

  abstract: We present the results of automatic evaluation of discourse in machine
    translation (MT) outputs using the EVALD tool. EVALD was originally designed and
    trained to assess the quality of human writing, for native speakers and foreign-language
    learners. MT has seen a tremendous leap in translation quality at the level of
    sentences and it is thus interesting to see if the human-level evaluation is becoming
    relevant.

  abstract: We present a pilot study of machine translation of selected grammatical
    contrasts between Czech and English in WMT18 News Translation Task. For each phenomenon,
    we run a dedicated test which checks if the candidate translation expresses the
    phenomenon as expected or not. The proposed type of analysis is not an evaluation
    in the strict sense because the phenomenon can be correctly translated in various
    ways and we anticipate only one. What is nevertheless interesting are the differences
    between various MT systems and the single reference translation in their general
    tendency in handling the given phenomenon.

  abstract: We evaluate the output of 16 English-to-German MT systems with respect
    to the translation of pronouns in the context of the WMT 2018 competition. We
    work with a test suite specifically designed to assess system quality in various
    fine-grained categories known to be problematic. The main evaluation scores come
    from a semi-automatic process, combining automatic reference matching with extensive
    manual annotation of uncertain cases. We find that current NMT systems are good
    at translating pronouns with intra-sentential reference, but the inter-sentential
    cases remain difficult. NMT systems are also good at the translation of event
    pronouns, unlike systems from the phrase-based SMT paradigm. No single system
    performs best at translating all types of anaphoric pronouns, suggesting unexplained
    random effects influencing the translation of pronouns with NMT.

  abstract: We present an analysis of 16 state-of-the-art MT systems on German-English
    based on a linguistically-motivated test suite. The test suite has been devised
    manually by a team of language professionals in order to cover a broad variety
    of linguistic phenomena that MT often fails to translate properly. It contains
    5,000 test sentences covering 106 linguistic phenomena in 14 categories, with
    an increased focus on verb tenses, aspects and moods. The MT outputs are evaluated
    in a semi-automatic way through regular expressions that focus only on the part
    of the sentence that is relevant to each phenomenon. Through our analysis, we
    are able to compare systems based on their performance on these categories. Additionally,
    we reveal strengths and weaknesses of particular systems and we identify grammatical
    phenomena where the overall performance of MT is relatively low.

  abstract: This paper describes the MeMAD project entry to the WMT Multimodal Machine
    Translation Shared Task. We propose adapting the Transformer neural machine translation
    (NMT) architecture to a multi-modal setting. In this paper, we also describe the
    preliminary experiments with text-only translation systems leading us up to this
    choice. We have the top scoring system for both English-to-German and English-to-French,
    according to the automatic metrics for flickr18. Our experiments show that the
    effect of the visual features in our system is small. Our largest gains come from
    the quality of the underlying text-only NMT system. We find that appropriate use
    of additional data is effective.

  abstract: 'We present our submission to the WMT18 Multimodal Translation Task. The
    main feature of our submission is applying a self-attentive network instead of
    a recurrent neural network. We evaluate two methods of incorporating the visual
    features in the model: first, we include the image representation as another input
    to the network; second, we train the model to predict the visual features and
    use it as an auxiliary objective. For our submission, we acquired both textual
    and multimodal additional data. Both of the proposed methods yield significant
    improvements over recurrent networks and self-attentive textual baselines.'

    \ re-ranking approaches. More specifically, n-best translation candidates from\
    \ this system are re-ranked using novel multimodal cross-lingual word sense disambiguation\
    \ models. For task 1b, we explore three approaches: (i) re-ranking based on cross-lingual\
    \ word sense disambiguation (as for task 1), (ii) re-ranking based on consensus\
    \ of NMT n-best lists from German-Czech, French-Czech and English-Czech systems,\
    \ and (iii) data augmentation by generating English source data through machine\
    \ translation from French to English and from German to English followed by hypothesis\

  abstract: For the WMT 2018 shared task of translating documents pertaining to the
    Biomedical domain, we developed a scoring formula that uses an unsophisticated
    and effective method of weighting term frequencies and was integrated in a data
    selection pipeline. The method was applied on five language pairs and it performed
    best on Portuguese-English, where a BLEU score of 41.84 placed it third out of
    seven runs submitted by three institutions. In this paper, we describe our method
    and results with a special focus on Spanish-English where we compare it against
    a state-of-the-art method. Our contribution to the task lies in introducing a
    fast, unsupervised method for selecting domain-specific data for training models
    which obtain good results using only 10% of the general domain data.

  abstract: This paper describes the system of Fraunhofer FOKUS for the WMT 2018 biomedical
    translation task. Our approach, described here, was to automatically select the
    most promising translation from a set of candidates produced with NMT (Transformer)
    models. We selected the highest fidelity translation of each sentence by using
    a dictionary, stemming and a set of heuristics. Our method is simple, can use
    any machine translators, and requires no further training in addition to that
    already employed to build the NMT models. The downside is that the score did not
    increase over the best in ensemble, but was quite close to it (difference about
    0.5 BLEU).

    \ That means parameters of the previous training serve as the initialization of\

    \ translation quality with 3.73 BLEU points over the baseline. Furthermore, we\
    \ applied ensemble learning on training models of intermediate epochs and achieved\

    Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) team for the biomedical translation
    shared task. Our systems are based on statistical machine translation and neural
    machine translation, using the Moses and OpenNMT toolkits, respectively. We participated
    in four translation directions for the English/Spanish and English/Portuguese
    language pairs. To create our training data, we concatenated several parallel
    corpora, both from in-domain and out-of-domain sources, as well as terminological
    resources from UMLS. Our systems achieved the best BLEU scores according to the
    official shared task evaluation.

  abstract: "This paper presents the results of the WMT18 Metrics Shared Task. We\
    \ asked participants of this task to score the outputs of the MT systems involved\
    \ in the WMT18 News Translation Task with automatic metrics. We collected scores\
    \ of 10 metrics and 8 research groups. In addition to that, we computed scores\
    \ of 8 standard metrics (BLEU, SentBLEU, chrF, NIST, WER, PER, TER and CDER) as\
    \ baselines. The collected scores were evaluated in terms of system-level correlation\
    \ (how well each metric\u2019s scores correlate with WMT18 official manual ranking\
    \ of systems) and in terms of segment-level correlation (how often a metric agrees\
    \ with humans in judging the quality of a particular sentence relative to alternate\
    \ outputs). This year, we employ a single kind of manual evaluation: direct assessment\
    \ (DA)."

  abstract: "We present the results from the fourth round of the WMT shared task on\
    \ MT Automatic Post-Editing. The task consists in automatically correcting the\
    \ output of a \u201Cblack-box\u201D machine translation system by learning from\
    \ human corrections. Keeping the same general evaluation setting of the three\
    \ previous rounds, this year we focused on one language pair (English-German)\
    \ and on domain-specific data (Information Technology), with MT outputs produced\
    \ by two different paradigms: phrase-based (PBSMT) and neural (NMT). Five teams\
    \ submitted respectively 11 runs for the PBSMT subtask and 10 runs for the NMT\
    \ subtask. In the former subtask, characterized by original translations of lower\
    \ quality, top results achieved impressive improvements, up to -6.24 TER and +9.53\
    \ BLEU points over the baseline \u201Cdo-nothing\u201D system. The NMT subtask\
    \ proved to be more challenging due to the higher quality of the original translations\
    \ and the availability of less training data. In this case, top results show smaller\
    \ improvements up to -0.38 TER and +0.8 BLEU points."

  abstract: "In machine translation evaluation, a good candidate translation can be\
    \ regarded as a paraphrase of the reference. We notice that some words are always\
    \ copied during paraphrasing, which we call copy knowledge. Considering the stability\
    \ of such knowledge, a good candidate translation should contain all these words\
    \ appeared in the reference sentence. Therefore, in this participation of the\
    \ WMT\u20192018 metrics shared task we introduce a simple statistical method for\
    \ copy knowledge extraction, and incorporate it into Meteor metric, resulting\
    \ in a new machine translation metric Meteor++. Our experiments show that Meteor++\
    \ can nicely integrate copy knowledge and improve the performance significantly\
    \ on WMT17 and WMT15 evaluation sets."

  abstract: The paper presents our participation in the WMT 2018 Metrics Shared Task.
    We propose an improved version of Translation Edit/Error Rate (TER). In addition
    to including the basic edit operations in TER, namely - insertion, deletion, substitution
    and shift, our metric also allows stem matching, optimizable edit costs and better
    normalization so as to correlate better with human judgement scores. The proposed
    metric shows much higher correlation with human judgments than TER.

  abstract: We introduce the RUSE metric for the WMT18 metrics shared task. Sentence
    embeddings can capture global information that cannot be captured by local features
    based on character or word N-grams. Although training sentence embeddings using
    small-scale translation datasets with manual evaluation is difficult, sentence
    embeddings trained from large-scale data in other tasks can improve the automatic
    evaluation of machine translation. We use a multi-layer perceptron regressor based
    on three types of sentence embeddings. The experimental results of the WMT16 and
    WMT17 datasets show that the RUSE metric achieves a state-of-the-art performance
    in both segment- and system-level metrics tasks with embedding features only.

  abstract: The paper presents our participation in the WMT 2018 shared task on word
    level quality estimation (QE) of machine translated (MT) text, i.e., to predict
    whether a word in MT output for a given source context is correctly translated
    and hence should be retained in the post-edited translation (PE), or not. To perform
    the QE task, we measure the similarity of the source context of the target MT
    word with the context for which the word is retained in PE in the training data.
    This is achieved in two different ways, using Bag-of-Words (BoW) model and Document-to-Vector
    (Doc2Vec) model. In the BoW model, we compute the cosine similarity while in the
    Doc2Vec model we consider the Doc2Vec similarity. By applying the Kneedle algorithm
    on the F1mult vs. similarity score plot, we derive the threshold based on which
    OK/BAD decisions are taken for the MT words. Experimental results revealed that
    the Doc2Vec model performs better than the BoW model on the word level QE task.

  abstract: With improved prediction combination using weights based on their training
    performance and stacking and multilayer perceptrons to build deeper prediction
    models, RTMs become the 3rd system in general at the sentence-level prediction
    of translation scores and achieve the lowest RMSE in English to German NMT QET
    results. For the document-level task, we compare document-level RTM models with
    sentence-level RTM models obtained with the concatenation of document sentences
    and obtain similar results.

  abstract: A huge amount of valuable resources is available on the web in English,
    which are often translated into local languages to facilitate knowledge sharing
    among local people who are not much familiar with English. However, translating
    such content manually is very tedious, costly, and time-consuming process. To
    this end, machine translation is an efficient approach to translate text without
    any human involvement. Neural machine translation (NMT) is one of the most recent
    and effective translation technique amongst all existing machine translation systems.
    In this paper, we apply NMT for English-Tamil language pair. We propose a novel
    neural machine translation technique using word-embedding along with Byte-Pair-Encoding
    (BPE) to develop an efficient translation system that overcomes the OOV (Out Of
    Vocabulary) problem for languages which do not have much translations available
    online. We use the BLEU score for evaluating the system performance. Experimental
    results confirm that our proposed MIDAS translator (8.33 BLEU score) outperforms
    Google translator (3.75 BLEU score).

  abstract: In this paper, a novel approach to Quality Estimation is introduced, which
    extends the method in (Duma and Menzel, 2017) by also considering pseudo-reference
    translations as data sources to the tree and sequence kernels used before. Two
    variants of the system were submitted to the sentence level WMT18 Quality Estimation
    Task for the English-German language pair. They have been ranked 4th and 6th out
    of 13 systems in the SMT track, while in the NMT track ranks 4 and 5 out of 11
    submissions have been reached.

    \ variant, where the final score is estimated by a Support Vector Regressor trained\
    \ on the available annotated datasets. The main goal of our minimalist approach\
    \ to quality estimation is to provide reliable estimators that require minimal\
    \ deployment effort, few resources, and, in the case of uMQE, do not depend on\
    \ costly data annotation or post-editing. Our approach was applied to all language\
    \ pairs in sentence quality estimation, obtaining competitive results across the\
    \ board."

  abstract: The task of word-level quality estimation (QE) consists of taking a source
    sentence and machine-generated translation, and predicting which words in the
    output are correct and which are wrong. In this paper, propose a method to effectively
    encode the local and global contextual information for each target word using
    a three-part neural network approach. The first part uses an embedding layer to
    represent words and their part-of-speech tags in both languages. The second part
    leverages a one-dimensional convolution layer to integrate local context information
    for each target word. The third part applies a stack of feed-forward and recurrent
    neural networks to further encode the global context in the sentence before making
    the predictions. This model was submitted as the CMU entry to the WMT2018 shared
    task on QE, and achieves strong results, ranking first in three of the six tracks.

  abstract: The goal of WMT 2018 Shared Task on Translation Quality Estimation is
    to investigate automatic methods for estimating the quality of machine translation
    results without reference translations. This paper presents the QE Brain system,
    which proposes the neural Bilingual Expert model as a feature extractor based
    on conditional target language model with a bidirectional transformer and then
    processes the semantic representations of source and the translation output with
    a Bi-LSTM predictive model for automatic quality estimation. The system has been
    applied to the sentence-level scoring and ranking tasks as well as the word-level
    tasks for finding errors for each word in translations. An extensive set of experimental
    results have shown that our system outperformed the best results in WMT 2017 Quality
    Estimation tasks and obtained top results in WMT 2018.

  abstract: This paper describes the submissions of the team from the University of
    Tartu for the sentence-level Quality Estimation shared task of WMT18. The proposed
    models use features based on attention weights of a neural machine translation
    system and cross-lingual phrase embeddings as input features of a regression model.
    Two of the proposed models require only a neural machine translation system with
    an attention mechanism with no additional resources. Results show that combining
    neural networks and baseline features leads to significant improvements over the
    baseline features alone.

  abstract: This paper describes the Microsoft and University of Edinburgh submission
    to the Automatic Post-editing shared task at WMT2018. Based on training data and
    systems from the WMT2017 shared task, we re-implement our own models from the
    last shared task and introduce improvements based on extensive parameter sharing.
    Next we experiment with our implementation of dual-source transformer models and
    data selection for the IT domain. Our submissions decisively wins the SMT post-editing
    sub-task establishing the new state-of-the-art and is a very close second (or
    equal, 16.46 vs 16.50 TER) in the NMT sub-task. Based on the rather weak results
    in the NMT sub-task, we hypothesize that neural-on-neural APE might not be actually
    useful.

    \ The proposed model is an extension of the transformer architecture: two separate\

    \ the multi-source {src, mt} \u2192 pe and single-source mt \u2192 pe models.\
    \ For both the PBSMT and the NMT task, the ensemble yields the best results, followed\

  abstract: Recent approaches to the Automatic Post-editing (APE) of Machine Translation
    (MT) have shown that best results are obtained by neural multi-source models that
    correct the raw MT output by also considering information from the corresponding
    source sentence. To this aim, we present for the first time a neural multi-source
    APE model based on the Transformer architecture. Moreover, we employ sequence-level
    loss functions in order to avoid exposure bias during training and to be consistent
    with the automatic evaluation metrics used for the task. These are the main features
    of our submissions to the WMT 2018 APE shared task, where we participated both
    in the PBSMT subtask (i.e. the correction of MT outputs from a phrase-based system)
    and in the NMT subtask (i.e. the correction of neural outputs). In the first subtask,
    our system improves over the baseline up to -5.3 TER and +8.23 BLEU points ranking
    second out of 11 submitted runs. In the second one, characterized by the higher
    quality of the initial translations, we report lower but statistically significant
    gains (up to -0.38 TER and +0.8 BLEU), ranking first out of 10 submissions.

  abstract: "Our entry to the parallel corpus filtering task uses a two-step strategy.\
    \ The first step uses a series of pragmatic hard \u2018rules\u2019 to remove the\
    \ worst example sentences. This first step reduces the effective corpus size down\
    \ from the initial 1 billion to 160 million tokens. The second step uses four\
    \ different heuristics weighted to produce a score that is then used for further\
    \ filtering down to 100 or 10 million tokens. Our final system produces competitive\
    \ results without requiring excessive fine tuning to the exact task or language\
    \ pair. The first step in isolation provides a very fast filter that gives most\
    \ of the gains of the final system."

  abstract: "We describe Vicomtech\u2019s participation in the WMT 2018 Shared Task\
    \ on parallel corpus filtering. We aimed to evaluate a simple approach to the\
    \ task, which can efficiently process large volumes of data and can be easily\
    \ deployed for new datasets in different language pairs and domains. We based\
    \ our approach on STACC, an efficient and portable method for parallel sentence\
    \ identification in comparable corpora. To address the specifics of the corpus\
    \ filtering task, which features significant volumes of noisy data, the core method\
    \ was expanded with a penalty based on the amount of unknown words in sentence\
    \ pairs. Additionally, we experimented with a complementary data saturation method\
    \ based on source sentence n-grams, with the goal of demoting parallel sentence\
    \ pairs that do not contribute significant amounts of yet unobserved n-grams.\
    \ Our approach requires no prior training and is highly efficient on the type\
    \ of large datasets featured in the corpus filtering task. We achieved competitive\
    \ results with this simple and portable method, ranking in the top half among\
    \ competing systems overall."

  abstract: A hybrid pipeline comprising rules and machine learning is used to filter
    a noisy web English-German parallel corpus for the Parallel Corpus Filtering task.
    The core of the pipeline is a module based on the logistic regression algorithm
    that returns the probability that a translation unit is accepted. The training
    set for the logistic regression is created by automatic annotation. The quality
    of the automatic annotation is estimated by manually labeling the training set.

    \ important for improving the quality of machine translation systems, especially\

    \ relying on bilingual word embeddings created without any bilingual signal. After\
    \ pre-filtering noisy data we rank sentence pairs by calculating bilingual sentence-level\
    \ similarities and then remove redundant data by employing monolingual similarity\
    \ as well. Our unsupervised system achieved good performance during the official\
    \ evaluation of the shared task, scoring only a few BLEU points behind the best\
    \ systems, while not requiring any parallel training data."

  abstract: In this work we introduce dual conditional cross-entropy filtering for
    noisy parallel data. For each sentence pair of the noisy parallel corpus we compute
    cross-entropy scores according to two inverse translation models trained on clean
    data. We penalize divergent cross-entropies and weigh the penalty by the cross-entropy
    average of both models. Sorting or thresholding according to these scores results
    in better subsets of parallel data. We achieve higher BLEU scores with models
    trained on parallel data filtered only from Paracrawl than with models trained
    on clean WMT data. We further evaluate our method in the context of the WMT2018
    shared task on parallel corpus filtering and achieve the overall highest ranking
    scores of the shared task, scoring top in three out of four subtasks.

  abstract: This work describes our submission to the WMT18 Parallel Corpus Filtering
    shared task. We use a slightly modified version of the Zipporah Corpus Filtering
    toolkit (Xu and Koehn, 2017), which computes an adequacy score and a fluency score
    on a sentence pair, and use a weighted sum of the scores as the selection criteria.
    This work differs from Zipporah in that we experiment with using the noisy corpus
    to be filtered to compute the combination weights, and thus avoids generating
    synthetic data as in standard Zipporah.

    \ challenged teams to score sentence pairs from a large high-recall, low-precision\

    \ ourselves an additional constraint that we not utilize the additional clean\

  abstract: This paper describes the Alibaba Machine Translation Group submissions
    to the WMT 2018 Shared Task on Parallel Corpus Filtering. While evaluating the
    quality of the parallel corpus, the three characteristics of the corpus are investigated,
    i.e. 1) the bilingual/translation quality, 2) the monolingual quality and 3) the
    corpus diversity. Both rule-based and model-based methods are adapted to score
    the parallel sentence pairs. The final parallel corpus filtering system is reliable,
    easy to build and adapt to other language pairs.

  abstract: "We present the UTFPR systems at the WMT 2018 parallel corpus filtering\
    \ task. Our supervised approach discerns between good and bad translations by\
    \ training classic binary classification models over an artificially produced\
    \ binary classification dataset derived from a high-quality translation set, and\
    \ a minimalistic set of 6 semantic distance features that rely only on easy-to-gather\
    \ resources. We rank translations by their probability for the \u201Cgood\u201D\
    \ label. Our results show that logistic regression pairs best with our approach,\
    \ yielding more consistent results throughout the different settings evaluated."

  abstract: This paper describes the submission of the Institute for Language and
    Speech Processing/Athena Research and Innovation Center (ILSP/ARC) for the WMT
    2018 Parallel Corpus Filtering shared task. We explore several properties of sentences
    and sentence pairs that our system explored in the context of the task with the
    purpose of clustering sentence pairs according to their appropriateness in training
    MT systems. We also discuss alternative methods for ranking the sentence pairs
    of the most appropriate clusters with the aim of generating the two datasets (of
    10 and 100 million words as required in the task) that were evaluated. By summarizing
    the results of several experiments that were carried out by the organizers during
    the evaluation phase, our submission achieved an average BLEU score of 26.41,
    even though it does not make use of any language-specific resources like bilingual
    lexica, monolingual corpora, or MT output, while the average score of the best
    participant system was 27.91.

  abstract: Most previous work on neural text generation from graph-structured data
    relies on standard sequence-to-sequence methods. These approaches linearise the
    input graph to be fed to a recurrent neural network. In this paper, we propose
    an alternative encoder based on graph convolutional networks that directly exploits
    the input structure. We report results on two graph-to-sequence datasets that
    empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding the input graph structure.

  abstract: 'We aim to automatically generate natural language descriptions about
    an input structured knowledge base (KB). We build our generation framework based
    on a pointer network which can copy facts from the input KB, and add two attention
    mechanisms: (i) slot-aware attention to capture the association between a slot
    type and its corresponding slot value; and (ii) a new table position self-attention
    to capture the inter-dependencies among related slots. For evaluation, besides
    standard metrics including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, we propose a KB reconstruction
    based metric by extracting a KB from the generation output and comparing it with
    the input KB. We also create a new data set which includes 106,216 pairs of structured
    KBs and their corresponding natural language descriptions for two distinct entity
    types. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
    methods. The reconstructed KB achieves 68.8% - 72.6% F-score.'

  abstract: Natural Language Generation plays an important role in the domain of dialogue
    systems as it determines how users perceive the system. Recently, deep-learning
    based systems have been proposed to tackle this task, as they generalize better
    and require less amounts of manual effort to implement them for new domains. However,
    deep learning systems usually adapt a very homogeneous sounding writing style
    which expresses little variation. In this work, we present our system for Natural
    Language Generation where we control various aspects of the surface realization
    in order to increase the lexical variability of the utterances, such that they
    sound more diverse and interesting. For this, we use a Semantically Controlled
    Long Short-term Memory Network (SC-LSTM), and apply its specialized cell to control
    various syntactic features of the generated texts. We present an in-depth human
    evaluation where we show the effects of these surface manipulation on the perception
    of potential users.

  abstract: The current study investigated novel techniques and methods for trainable
    approaches to data-to-text generation. Neural Machine Translation was explored
    for the conversion from data to text as well as the addition of extra templatization
    steps of the data input and text output in the conversion process. Evaluation
    using BLEU did not find the Neural Machine Translation technique to perform any
    better compared to rule-based or Statistical Machine Translation, and the templatization
    method seemed to perform similarly or sometimes worse compared to direct data-to-text
    conversion. However, the human evaluation metrics indicated that Neural Machine
    Translation yielded the highest quality output and that the templatization method
    was able to increase text quality in multiple situations.

  abstract: Learning to generate fluent natural language from structured data with
    neural networks has become an common approach for NLG. This problem can be challenging
    when the form of the structured data varies between examples. This paper presents
    a survey of several extensions to sequence-to-sequence models to account for the
    latent content selection process, particularly variants of copy attention and
    coverage decoding. We further propose a training method based on diverse ensembling
    to encourage models to learn distinct sentence templates during training. An empirical
    evaluation of these techniques shows an increase in the quality of generated text
    across five automated metrics, as well as human evaluation.

  abstract: We introduce SimpleNLG-ZH, a realisation engine for Mandarin that follows
    the software design paradigm of SimpleNLG (Gatt and Reiter, 2009). We explain
    the core grammar (morphology and syntax) and the lexicon of SimpleNLG-ZH, which
    is very different from English and other languages for which SimpleNLG engines
    have been built. The system was evaluated by regenerating expressions from a body
    of test sentences and a corpus of human-authored expressions. Human evaluation
    was conducted to estimate the quality of regenerated sentences.

  abstract: "This paper introduces the task of \u201Cflipping\u201D the bias of news\
    \ articles: Given an article with a political bias (left or right), generate an\
    \ article with the same topic but opposite bias. To study this task, we create\
    \ a corpus with bias-labeled articles from all-sides.com. As a first step, we\
    \ analyze the corpus and discuss intrinsic characteristics of bias. They point\
    \ to the main challenges of bias flipping, which in turn lead to a specific setting\
    \ in the generation process. The paper in hand narrows down the general bias flipping\
    \ task to focus on bias flipping for news article headlines. A manual annotation\
    \ of headlines from each side reveals that they are self-informative in general\
    \ and often convey bias. We apply an autoencoder incorporating information from\
    \ an article\u2019s content to learn how to automatically flip the bias. From\
    \ 200 generated headlines, 73 are classified as understandable by annotators,\
    \ and 83 maintain the topic while having opposite bias. Insights from our analysis\
    \ shed light on how to solve the main challenges of bias flipping."

  abstract: "Recent neural models for response generation show good results in terms\

    \ to consider individual user\u2019s information in adjusting the notable sequence-to-sequence\
    \ (seq2seq) model for more diverse, user-specific responses. We assume that we\
    \ need user-specific features to adjust the response and we argue that some selected\
    \ representative words from the users are suitable for this task. Furthermore,\
    \ we prove that even for unseen or unknown users, our model can provide more diverse\
    \ and interesting responses, while maintaining correlation with input utterances.\
    \ Experimental results with human evaluation show that our model can generate\
    \ more interesting responses than the popular seq2seqmodel and achieve higher\

  abstract: The current most popular method for automatic Natural Language Generation
    (NLG) evaluation is comparing generated text with human-written reference sentences
    using a metrics system, which has drawbacks around reliability and scalability.
    We draw inspiration from second language (L2) assessment and extract a set of
    linguistic features to predict human judgments of sentence naturalness. Our experiment
    using a small dataset showed that the feature-based approach yields promising
    results, with the added potential of providing interpretability into the source
    of the problems.

  abstract: We present SpatialVOC2K, the first multilingual image dataset with spatial
    relation annotations and object features for image-to-text generation, built using
    2,026 images from the PASCAL VOC2008 dataset. The dataset incorporates (i) the
    labelled object bounding boxes from VOC2008, (ii) geometrical, language and depth
    features for each object, and (iii) for each pair of objects in both orders, (a)
    the single best preposition and (b) the set of possible prepositions in the given
    language that describe the spatial relationship between the two objects. Compared
    to previous versions of the dataset, we have roughly doubled the size for French,
    and completely reannotated as well as increased the size of the English portion,
    providing single best prepositions for English for the first time. Furthermore,
    we have added explicit 3D depth features for objects. We are releasing our dataset
    for free reuse, along with evaluation tools to enable comparative evaluation.

  abstract: Detection of spatial relations between objects in images is currently
    a popular subject in image description research. A range of different language
    and geometric object features have been used in this context, but methods have
    not so far used explicit information about the third dimension (depth), except
    when manually added to annotations. The lack of such information hampers detection
    of spatial relations that are inherently 3D. In this paper, we use a fully automatic
    method for creating a depth map of an image and derive several different object-level
    depth features from it which we add to an existing feature set to test the effect
    on spatial relation detection. We show that performance increases are obtained
    from adding depth features in all scenarios tested.

  abstract: We study the problem of opinion question generation from sentences with
    the help of community-based question answering systems. For this purpose, we use
    a sequence to sequence attentional model, and we adopt coverage mechanism to prevent
    sentences from repeating themselves. Experimental results on the Amazon question/answer
    dataset show an improvement in automatic evaluation metrics as well as human evaluations
    from the state-of-the-art question generation systems.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a self-learning architecture for generating
    natural language templates for conversational assistants. Generating templates
    to cover all the combinations of slots in an intent is time consuming and labor-intensive.
    We examine three different models based on our proposed architecture - Rule-based
    model, Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model and Semantically Conditioned LSTM
    (SC-LSTM) model for the IoT domain - to reduce the human labor required for template
    generation. We demonstrate the feasibility of template generation for the IoT
    domain using our self-learning architecture. In both automatic and human evaluation,
    the self-learning architecture outperforms previous works trained with a fully
    human-labeled dataset. This is promising for commercial conversational assistant
    solutions.

  abstract: This paper presents a study to understand the issues related to using
    NLG to humanise explanations from a popular interpretable machine learning framework
    called LIME. Our study shows that self-reported rating of NLG explanation was
    higher than that for a non-NLG explanation. However, when tested for comprehension,
    the results were not as clear-cut showing the need for performing more studies
    to uncover the factors responsible for high-quality NLG explanations.

  abstract: There has been many works published for automatic sentence generation
    of a variety of domains. However, there would be still no single method available
    at present that can generate sentences for all of domains. Each domain will require
    a suitable generation method. We focus on automatic generation of Japanese advertisement
    slogans in this paper. We use our advertisement slogan database, case frame information,
    and word vector information. We employed our system to apply for a copy competition
    for human copywriters, where our advertisement slogan was left as a finalist.
    Our system could be regarded as the world first system that generates slogans
    in a practical level, as an advertising agency already employs our system in their
    business.

  abstract: Hypertagging, or supertagging for surface realization, is the process
    of assigning lexical categories to nodes in an input semantic graph. Previous
    work has shown that hypertagging significantly increases realization speed and
    quality by reducing the search space of the realizer. Building on recent work
    using LSTMs to improve accuracy on supertagging for parsing, we develop an LSTM
    hypertagging method for OpenCCG, an open source NLP toolkit for CCG. Our results
    show significant improvements in both hypertagging accuracy and downstream realization
    performance.

  abstract: We present a comparison of word-based and character-based sequence-to-sequence
    models for data-to-text natural language generation, which generate natural language
    descriptions for structured inputs. On the datasets of two recent generation challenges,
    our models achieve comparable or better automatic evaluation results than the
    best challenge submissions. Subsequent detailed statistical and human analyses
    shed light on the differences between the two input representations and the diversity
    of the generated texts. In a controlled experiment with synthetic training data
    generated from templates, we demonstrate the ability of neural models to learn
    novel combinations of the templates and thereby generalize beyond the linguistic
    structures they were trained on.

  abstract: E-commerce platforms present products using titles that summarize product
    information. These titles cannot be created by hand, therefore an algorithmic
    solution is required. The task of automatically generating these titles given
    noisy user provided titles is one way to achieve the goal. The setting requires
    the generation process to be fast and the generated title to be both human-readable
    and concise. Furthermore, we need to understand if such generated titles are usable.
    As such, we propose approaches that (i) automatically generate product titles,
    (ii) predict their quality. Our approach scales to millions of products and both
    automatic and human evaluations performed on real-world data indicate our approaches
    are effective and applicable to existing e-commerce scenarios.

  abstract: This paper presents a project about the automatic generation of persuasive
    messages in the context of the diet management. In the first part of the paper
    we introduce the basic mechanisms related to data interpretation and content selection
    for a numerical data-to-text generation architecture. In the second part of the
    paper we discuss a number of factors influencing the design of the messages. In
    particular, we consider the design of the aggregation procedure. Finally, we present
    the results of a human-based evaluation concerning this design factor.

  abstract: In this paper we study the performance of several state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence
    models applied to generation of short company descriptions. The models are evaluated
    on a newly created and publicly available company dataset that has been collected
    from Wikipedia. The dataset consists of around 51K company descriptions that can
    be used for both concept-to-text and text-to-text generation tasks. Automatic
    metrics and human evaluation scores computed on the generated company descriptions
    show promising results despite the difficulty of the task as the dataset (like
    most available datasets) has not been originally designed for machine learning.
    In addition, we perform correlation analysis between automatic metrics and human
    evaluations and show that certain automatic metrics are more correlated to human
    judgments.

  abstract: The automatic generation of stimulating questions is crucial to the development
    of intelligent cognitive exercise applications. We developed an approach that
    generates appropriate Questioning the Author queries based on novel metaphors
    in diverse syntactic relations in literature. We show that the generated questions
    are comparable to human-generated questions in terms of naturalness, sensibility,
    and depth, and score slightly higher than human-generated questions in terms of
    clarity. We also show that questions generated about novel metaphors are rated
    as cognitively deeper than questions generated about non- or conventional metaphors,
    providing evidence that metaphor novelty can be leveraged to promote cognitive
    exercise.

  abstract: 'Responses in task-oriented dialogue systems often realize multiple propositions
    whose ultimate form depends on the use of sentence planning and discourse structuring
    operations. For example a recommendation may consist of an explicitly evaluative
    utterance e.g. Chanpen Thai is the best option, along with content related by
    the justification discourse relation, e.g. It has great food and service, that
    combines multiple propositions into a single phrase. While neural generation methods
    integrate sentence planning and surface realization in one end-to-end learning
    framework, previous work has not shown that neural generators can: (1) perform
    common sentence planning and discourse structuring operations; (2) make decisions
    as to whether to realize content in a single sentence or over multiple sentences;
    (3) generalize sentence planning and discourse relation operations beyond what
    was seen in training. We systematically create large training corpora that exhibit
    particular sentence planning operations and then test neural models to see what
    they learn. We compare models without explicit latent variables for sentence planning
    with ones that provide explicit supervision during training. We show that only
    the models with additional supervision can reproduce sentence planning and discourse
    operations and generalize to situations unseen in training.'

  abstract: "In the last few years Automatic Question Generation (AQG) has attracted\
    \ increasing interest. In this paper we survey the evaluation methodologies used\
    \ in AQG. Based on a sample of 37 papers, our research shows that the systems\u2019\
    \ development has not been accompanied by similar developments in the methodologies\
    \ used for the systems\u2019 evaluation. Indeed, in the papers we examine here,\
    \ we find a wide variety of both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methodologies.\
    \ Such diverse evaluation practices make it difficult to reliably compare the\
    \ quality of different generation systems. Our study suggests that, given the\
    \ rapidly increasing level of research in the area, a common framework is urgently\
    \ needed to compare the performance of AQG systems and NLG systems more generally."

  abstract: "This paper summarises the experimental setup and results of the first\
    \ shared task on end-to-end (E2E) natural language generation (NLG) in spoken\
    \ dialogue systems. Recent end-to-end generation systems are promising since they\
    \ reduce the need for data annotation. However, they are currently limited to\
    \ small, delexicalised datasets. The E2E NLG shared task aims to assess whether\
    \ these novel approaches can generate better-quality output by learning from a\
    \ dataset containing higher lexical richness, syntactic complexity and diverse\
    \ discourse phenomena. We compare 62 systems submitted by 17 institutions, covering\
    \ a wide range of approaches, including machine learning architectures \u2013\
    \ with the majority implementing sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) \u2013\
    \ as well as systems based on grammatical rules and templates."

  abstract: 'This paper addresses the task of generating descriptions of people for
    an observer that is moving within a scene. As the observer moves, the descriptions
    of the people around him also change. A referring expression generation algorithm
    adapted to this task needs to continuously monitor the changes in the field of
    view of the observer, his relative position to the people being described, and
    the relative position of these people to any landmarks around them, and to take
    these changes into account in the referring expressions generated. This task presents
    two advantages: many of the mechanisms already available for static contexts may
    be applied with small adaptations, and it introduces the concept of changing conditions
    into the task of referring expression generation. In this paper we describe the
    design of an algorithm that takes these aspects into account in order to create
    descriptions of people within a 3D virtual environment. The evaluation of this
    algorithm has shown that, by changing the descriptions in real time according
    to the observers point of view, they are able to identify the described person
    quickly and effectively.'

  abstract: The manual creation of gold standards for named entity recognition and
    entity linking is time- and resource-intensive. Moreover, recent works show that
    such gold standards contain a large proportion of mistakes in addition to being
    difficult to maintain. We hence present Bengal, a novel automatic generation of
    such gold standards as a complement to manually created benchmarks. The main advantage
    of our benchmarks is that they can be readily generated at any time. They are
    also cost-effective while being guaranteed to be free of annotation errors. We
    compare the performance of 11 tools on benchmarks in English generated by Bengal
    and on 16 benchmarks created manually. We show that our approach can be ported
    easily across languages by presenting results achieved by 4 tools on both Brazilian
    Portuguese and Spanish. Overall, our results suggest that our automatic benchmark
    generation approach can create varied benchmarks that have characteristics similar
    to those of existing benchmarks. Our approach is open-source. Our experimental
    results are available at http://faturl.com/bengalexpinlg and the code at https://github.com/dice-group/BENGAL.

  abstract: Neural approaches to data-to-text generation generally handle rare input
    items using either delexicalisation or a copy mechanism. We investigate the relative
    impact of these two methods on two datasets (E2E and WebNLG) and using two evaluation
    settings. We show (i) that rare items strongly impact performance; (ii) that combining
    delexicalisation and copying yields the strongest improvement; (iii) that copying
    underperforms for rare and unseen items and (iv) that the impact of these two
    mechanisms greatly varies depending on how the dataset is constructed and on how
    it is split into train, dev and test.

  abstract: Till now, neural abstractive summarization methods have achieved great
    success for single document summarization (SDS). However, due to the lack of large
    scale multi-document summaries, such methods can be hardly applied to multi-document
    summarization (MDS). In this paper, we investigate neural abstractive methods
    for MDS by adapting a state-of-the-art neural abstractive summarization model
    for SDS. We propose an approach to extend the neural abstractive model trained
    on large scale SDS data to the MDS task. Our approach only makes use of a small
    number of multi-document summaries for fine tuning. Experimental results on two
    benchmark DUC datasets demonstrate that our approach can outperform a variety
    of baseline neural models.

  abstract: Developing conventional natural language generation systems requires extensive
    attention from human experts in order to craft complex sets of sentence planning
    rules. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to learn sentence planning
    rules by inducing synchronous tree substitution grammars for pairs of text plans
    and morphosyntactically-specified dependency trees. Our system is able to learn
    rules which can be used to generate novel texts after training on small datasets.

  abstract: Image captioning models are typically trained on data that is collected
    from people who are asked to describe an image, without being given any further
    task context. As we argue here, this context independence is likely to cause problems
    for transferring to task settings in which image description is bound by task
    demands. We demonstrate that careful design of data collection is required to
    obtain image descriptions which are contextually bounded to a particular meta-level
    task. As a task, we use MeetUp!, a text-based communication game where two players
    have the goal of finding each other in a visual environment. To reach this goal,
    the players need to describe images representing their current location. We analyse
    a dataset from this domain and show that the nature of image descriptions found
    in MeetUp! is diverse, dynamic and rich with phenomena that are not present in
    descriptions obtained through a simple image captioning task, which we ran for
    comparison.

  abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance in a wide range
    of NLP tasks, yet their applications to sentence generation from logical representations
    are underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a sequence-to-sequence model for
    generating sentences from logical meaning representations based on event semantics.
    We use a semantic parsing system based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)
    to obtain data annotated with logical formulas. We augment our sequence-to-sequence
    model with masking for predicates to constrain output sentences. We also propose
    a novel evaluation method for generation using Recognizing Textual Entailment
    (RTE). Combining parsing and generation, we test whether or not the output sentence
    entails the original text and vice versa. Experiments showed that our model outperformed
    a baseline with respect to both BLEU scores and accuracies in RTE.

  abstract: Image description datasets, such as Flickr30K and MS COCO, show a high
    degree of variation in the ways that crowd-workers talk about the world. Although
    this gives us a rich and diverse collection of data to work with, it also introduces
    uncertainty about how the world should be described. This paper shows the extent
    of this uncertainty in the PEOPLE-domain. We present a taxonomy of different ways
    to talk about other people. This taxonomy serves as a reference point to think
    about how other people should be described, and can be used to classify and compute
    statistics about labels applied to people.

  abstract: "In this paper we present an automatic review generator system which can\
    \ generate personalized reviews based on the user identity, product identity and\
    \ designated rating the user wishes to allot to the review. We combine this with\
    \ a sentiment analysis system which performs the complimentary task of assigning\
    \ ratings to reviews based purely on the textual content of the review. We introduce\
    \ an additional loss term to ensure cyclic consistency of the sentiment rating\
    \ of the generated review with the conditioning rating used to generate the review.\
    \ The introduction of this new loss term constraints the generation space while\
    \ forcing it to generate reviews adhering better to the requested rating. The\
    \ use of \u2018soft\u2019 generation and cyclic consistency allows us to train\
    \ our model in an end to end fashion. We demonstrate the working of our model\
    \ on product reviews from Amazon dataset."

  abstract: The task of linearization is to find a grammatical order given a set of
    words. Traditional models use statistical methods. Syntactic linearization systems,
    which generate a sentence along with its syntactic tree, have shown state-of-the-art
    performance. Recent work shows that a multilayer LSTM language model outperforms
    competitive statistical syntactic linearization systems without using syntax.
    In this paper, we study neural syntactic linearization, building a transition-based
    syntactic linearizer leveraging a feed forward neural network, observing significantly
    better results compared to LSTM language models on this task.

  abstract: One of the biggest challenges of end-to-end language generation from meaning
    representations in dialogue systems is making the outputs more natural and varied.
    Here we take a large corpus of 50K crowd-sourced utterances in the restaurant
    domain and develop text analysis methods that systematically characterize types
    of sentences in the training data. We then automatically label the training data
    to allow us to conduct two kinds of experiments with a neural generator. First,
    we test the effect of training the system with different stylistic partitions
    and quantify the effect of smaller, but more stylistically controlled training
    data. Second, we propose a method of labeling the style variants during training,
    and show that we can modify the style of the generated utterances using our stylistic
    labels. We contrast and compare these methods that can be used with any existing
    large corpus, showing how they vary in terms of semantic quality and stylistic
    control.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission to the E2E NLG Challenge. Recently,
    neural seq2seq approaches have become mainstream in NLG, often resorting to pre-
    (respectively post-) processing delexicalization (relexicalization) steps at the
    word-level to handle rare words. By contrast, we train a simple character level
    seq2seq model, which requires no pre/post-processing (delexicalization, tokenization
    or even lowercasing), with surprisingly good results. For further improvement,
    we explore two re-ranking approaches for scoring candidates. We also introduce
    a synthetic dataset creation procedure, which opens up a new way of creating artificial
    datasets for Natural Language Generation.

  abstract: In natural language generation (NLG), the task is to generate utterances
    from a more abstract input, such as structured data. An added challenge is to
    generate utterances that contain an accurate representation of the input, while
    reflecting the fluency and variety of human-generated text. In this paper, we
    report experiments with NLG models that can be used in task oriented dialogue
    systems. We explore the use of additional input to the model to encourage diversity
    and control of outputs. While our submission does not rank highly using automated
    metrics, qualitative investigation of generated utterances suggests the use of
    additional information in neural network NLG systems to be a promising research
    direction.

  abstract: E2E NLG Challenge is a shared task on generating restaurant descriptions
    from sets of key-value pairs. This paper describes the results of our participation
    in the challenge. We develop a simple, yet effective neural encoder-decoder model
    which produces fluent restaurant descriptions and outperforms a strong baseline.
    We further analyze the data provided by the organizers and conclude that the task
    can also be approached with a template-based model developed in just a few hours.

  abstract: This paper argues that a new generic approach to statistical NLG can be
    made to perform Referring Expression Generation (REG) successfully. The model
    does not only select attributes and values for referring to a target referent,
    but also performs Linguistic Realisation, generating an actual Noun Phrase. Our
    evaluations suggest that the attribute selection aspect of the algorithm exceeds
    classic REG algorithms, while the Noun Phrases generated are as similar to those
    in a previously developed corpus as were Noun Phrases produced by a new set of
    human speakers.

  abstract: In this paper we study empirically the validity of measures of referential
    success for referring expressions involving gradual properties. More specifically,
    we study the ability of several measures of referential success to predict the
    success of a user in choosing the right object, given a referring expression.
    Experimental results indicate that certain fuzzy measures of success are able
    to predict human accuracy in reference resolution. Such measures are therefore
    suitable for the estimation of the success or otherwise of a referring expression
    produced by a generation algorithm, especially in case the properties in a domain
    cannot be assumed to have crisp denotations.

  abstract: "RNN-based sequence generation is now widely used in NLP and NLG (natural\
    \ language generation). Most work focusses on how to train RNNs, even though also\
    \ decoding is not necessarily straightforward: previous work on neural MT found\
    \ seq2seq models to radically prefer short candidates, and has proposed a number\
    \ of beam search heuristics to deal with this. In this work, we assess decoding\
    \ strategies for referring expression generation with neural models. Here, expression\
    \ length is crucial: output should neither contain too much or too little information,\
    \ in order to be pragmatically adequate. We find that most beam search heuristics\
    \ developed for MT do not generalize well to referring expression generation (REG),\
    \ and do not generally outperform greedy decoding. We observe that beam search\
    \ heuristics for termination seem to override the model\u2019s knowledge of what\
    \ a good stopping point is. Therefore, we also explore a recent approach called\
    \ trainable decoding, which uses a small network to modify the RNN\u2019s hidden\
    \ state for better decoding results. We find this approach to consistently outperform\
    \ greedy decoding for REG."

  abstract: This paper describes the L2TOR intelligent tutoring system (ITS), focusing
    primarily on its output generation module. The L2TOR ITS is developed for the
    purpose of investigating the efficacy of robot-assisted second language tutoring
    in early childhood. We explain the process of generating contextually-relevant
    utterances, such as task-specific feedback messages, and discuss challenges regarding
    multimodality and multilingualism for situated natural language generation from
    a robot tutoring perspective.

  abstract: "One of the most natural ways for human robot communication is through\
    \ spoken language. Training human-robot interaction systems require access to\
    \ large datasets which are expensive to obtain and labour intensive. In this paper,\
    \ we describe an approach for learning from minimal data, using as a toy example\
    \ language understanding in spoken dialogue systems. Understanding of spoken language\
    \ is crucial because it has implications for natural language generation, i.e.\
    \ correctly understanding a user\u2019s utterance will lead to choosing the right\
    \ response/action. Finally, we discuss implications for Natural Language Generation\
    \ in Human-Robot Interaction."

  abstract: Human-robot interactions situated in a dynamic environment create a unique
    mix of challenges for conversational systems. We argue that, on the one hand,
    NLG can contribute to addressing these challenges and that, on the other hand,
    they pose interesting research problems for NLG. To illustrate our position we
    describe our research on non-humanoid robots using non-verbal signals to support
    communication.

  abstract: Modeling traditional NLG tasks with data-driven techniques has been a
    major focus of research in NLG in the past decade. We argue that existing modeling
    techniques are mostly tailored to textual data and are not sufficient to make
    NLG technology meet the requirements of agents which target fluid interaction
    and collaboration in the real world. We revisit interactive instruction giving
    as a challenge for datadriven NLG and, based on insights from previous GIVE challenges,
    propose that instruction giving should be addressed in a setting that involves
    visual grounding and spoken language. These basic design decisions will require
    NLG frameworks that are capable of monitoring their environment as well as timing
    and revising their verbal output. We believe that these are core capabilities
    for making NLG technology transferrable to interactive systems.
