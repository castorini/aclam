  abstract: In this work, we investigate whether side information is helpful in neural
    machine translation (NMT). We study various kinds of side information, including
    topical information, personal trait, then propose different ways of incorporating
    them into the existing NMT models. Our experimental results show the benefits
    of side information in improving the NMT models.

  abstract: 'Among the more typical forensic voice comparison (FVC) approaches, the
    acoustic-phonetic statistical approach is suitable for text-dependent FVC, but
    it does not fully exploit available time-varying information of speech in its
    modelling. The automatic approach, on the other hand, essentially deals with text-independent
    cases, which means temporal information is not explicitly incorporated in the
    modelling. Text-dependent likelihood ratio (LR)-based FVC studies, in particular
    those that adopt the automatic approach, are few. This preliminary LR-based FVC
    study compares two statistical models, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Gaussian
    Mixture Model (GMM), for the calculation of forensic LRs using the same speech
    data. FVC experiments were carried out using different lengths of Japanese short
    words under a forensically realistic, but challenging condition: only two speech
    tokens for model training and LR estimation. Log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr)
    was used as the assessment metric. The study demonstrates that the HMM system
    constantly outperforms the GMM system in terms of average Cllr values. However,
    words longer than three mora are needed if the advantage of the HMM is to become
    evident. With a seven-mora word, for example, the HMM outperformed the GMM by
    a Cllr value of 0.073.'

    Untrained Forced Alignment (approx. 9% error when detecting the center of words),
    speech-to-text (37% WER in the best trained models) and POS tagging (92% accuracy

  abstract: It has been demonstrated that vector-based representations of words trained
    on large text corpora encode linguistic regularities that may be exploited via
    the use of vector space arithmetic. This capability has been extensively explored
    and is generally measured via tasks which involve the automated completion of
    linguistic proportional analogies. The question remains, however, as to what extent
    it is possible to induce relations from word embeddings in a principled and systematic
    way, without the provision of exemplars or seed terms. In this paper we propose
    an extensible and efficient framework for inducing relations via the use of constraint
    satisfaction. The method is efficient, unsupervised and can be customized in various
    ways. We provide both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results.

  abstract: The key activity to design an information system is conceptual modelling
    which brings out and describes the general knowledge that is required to build
    a system. In this paper we propose a novel approach to conceptual modelling where
    the domain experts will be able to specify and construct a model using a restricted
    form of natural language. A restricted natural language is a subset of a natural
    language that has well-defined computational properties and therefore can be translated
    unambiguously into a formal notation. We will argue that a restricted natural
    language is suitable for writing precise and consistent specifications that lead
    to executable conceptual models. Using a restricted natural language will allow
    the domain experts to describe a scenario in the terminology of the application
    domain without the need to formally encode this scenario. The resulting textual
    specification can then be automatically translated into the language of the desired
    conceptual modelling framework.

    \ a content-driven machine-learning approach which is both robust to noise and\
    \ generalises to unseen document formats. In a comparison of our approach with\
    \ alternative invoice extraction systems, we observe an absolute accuracy gain\

  abstract: "In spite of the recent success of Dialogue Act (DA) classification, the\
    \ majority of prior works focus on text-based classification with oracle transcriptions,\
    \ i.e. human transcriptions, instead of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\u2019\
    s transcriptions. In spoken dialog systems, however, the agent would only have\
    \ access to noisy ASR transcriptions, which may further suffer performance degradation\
    \ due to domain shift. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of using both\
    \ acoustic and textual signals, either oracle or ASR transcriptions, and investigate\
    \ speaker domain adaptation for DA classification. Our multimodal model proves\
    \ to be superior to the unimodal models, particularly when the oracle transcriptions\
    \ are not available. We also propose an effective method for speaker domain adaptation,\
    \ which achieves competitive results."

  abstract: Cluster labeling is the assignment of representative labels to clusters
    obtained from the organization of a document collection. Once assigned, the labels
    can play an important role in applications such as navigation, search and document
    classification. However, finding appropriately descriptive labels is still a challenging
    task. In this paper, we propose various approaches for assigning labels to word
    clusters by leveraging word embeddings and the synonymity and hypernymy relations
    in the WordNet lexical ontology. Experiments carried out using the WebAP document
    dataset have shown that one of the approaches stand out in the comparison and
    is capable of selecting labels that are reasonably aligned with those chosen by
    a pool of four human annotators.

    Our experimental results suggest that character- and document-level models capture

    of compositionality, with the advantage over word-level models that they do not
    require token-level identification of MWEs in the training corpus.

  abstract: Accurate evaluation of translation has long been a difficult, yet important
    problem. Current evaluations use direct assessment (DA), based on crowd sourcing
    judgements from a large pool of workers, along with quality control checks, and
    a robust method for combining redundant judgements. In this paper we show that
    the quality control mechanism is overly conservative, which increases the time
    and expense of the evaluation. We propose a model that does not rely on a pre-processing
    step to filter workers and takes into account varying annotator reliabilities.
    Our model effectively weights each worker's scores based on the inferred precision
    of the worker, and is much more reliable than the mean of either the raw scores
    or the standardised scores. We also show that DA does not deliver on the promise
    of longitudinal evaluation, and propose redesigning the structure of the annotation
    tasks that can solve this problem.

    a variety of approaches for this task and the best results, 0.778 micro-averaged
