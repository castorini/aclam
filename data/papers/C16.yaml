  abstract: We present an efficient model selection method using boosting for transition-based
    constituency parsing. It is designed for exploring a high-dimensional search space,
    defined by a large set of feature templates, as for example is typically the case
    when parsing morphologically rich languages. Our method removes the need to manually
    define heuristic constraints, which are often imposed in current state-of-the-art
    selection methods. Our experiments for French show that the method is more efficient
    and is also capable of producing compact, state-of-the-art models.

  abstract: 'Various treebanks have been released for dependency parsing. Despite
    that treebanks may belong to different languages or have different annotation
    schemes, they contain common syntactic knowledge that is potential to benefit
    each other. This paper presents a universal framework for transfer parsing across
    multi-typed treebanks with deep multi-task learning. We consider two kinds of
    treebanks as source: the multilingual universal treebanks and the monolingual
    heterogeneous treebanks. Knowledge across the source and target treebanks are
    effectively transferred through multi-level parameter sharing. Experiments on
    several benchmark datasets in various languages demonstrate that our approach
    can make effective use of arbitrary source treebanks to improve target parsing
    models.'

  abstract: Grammar induction is the task of learning syntactic structure in a setting
    where that structure is hidden. Grammar induction from words alone is interesting
    because it is similiar to the problem that a child learning a language faces.
    Previous work has typically assumed richer but cognitively implausible input,
    such as POS tag annotated data, which makes that work less relevant to human language
    acquisition. We show that grammar induction from words alone is in fact feasible
    when the model is provided with sufficient training data, and present two new
    streaming or mini-batch algorithms for PCFG inference that can learn from millions
    of words of training data. We compare the performance of these algorithms to a
    batch algorithm that learns from less data. The minibatch algorithms outperform
    the batch algorithm, showing that cheap inference with more data is better than
    intensive inference with less data. Additionally, we show that the harmonic initialiser,
    which previous work identified as essential when learning from small POS-tag annotated
    corpora (Klein and Manning, 2004), is not superior to a uniform initialisation.

  abstract: Existing sentence regression methods for extractive summarization usually
    model sentence importance and redundancy in two separate processes. They first
    evaluate the importance f(s) of each sentence s and then select sentences to generate
    a summary based on both the importance scores and redundancy among sentences.
    In this paper, we propose to model importance and redundancy simultaneously by
    directly evaluating the relative importance f(s|S) of a sentence s given a set
    of selected sentences S. Specifically, we present a new framework to conduct regression
    with respect to the relative gain of s given S calculated by the ROUGE metric.
    Besides the single sentence features, additional features derived from the sentence
    relations are incorporated. Experiments on the DUC 2001, 2002 and 2004 multi-document
    summarization datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
    extractive summarization approaches.

  abstract: Automatic video description generation has recently been getting attention
    after rapid advancement in image caption generation. Automatically generating
    description for a video is more challenging than for an image due to its temporal
    dynamics of frames. Most of the work relied on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    and recently attentional mechanisms have also been applied to make the model learn
    to focus on some frames of the video while generating each word in a describing
    sentence. In this paper, we focus on a sequence-to-sequence approach with temporal
    attention mechanism. We analyze and compare the results from different attention
    model configuration. By applying the temporal attention mechanism to the system,
    we can achieve a METEOR score of 0.310 on Microsoft Video Description dataset,
    which outperformed the state-of-the-art system so far.

  abstract: 'Teaching large classes remains a great challenge, primarily because it
    is difficult to attend to all the student needs in a timely manner. Automatic
    text summarization systems can be leveraged to summarize the student feedback,
    submitted immediately after each lecture, but it is left to be discovered what
    makes a good summary for student responses. In this work we explore a new methodology
    that effectively extracts summary phrases from the student responses. Each phrase
    is tagged with the number of students who raise the issue. The phrases are evaluated
    along two dimensions: with respect to text content, they should be informative
    and well-formed, measured by the ROUGE metric; additionally, they shall attend
    to the most pressing student needs, measured by a newly proposed metric. This
    work is enabled by a phrase-based annotation and highlighting scheme, which is
    new to the summarization task. The phrase-based framework allows us to summarize
    the student responses into a set of bullet points and present to the instructor
    promptly.'

  abstract: We present CATENA, a sieve-based system to perform temporal and causal
    relation extraction and classification from English texts, exploiting the interaction
    between the temporal and the causal model. We evaluate the performance of each
    sieve, showing that the rule-based, the machine-learned and the reasoning components
    all contribute to achieving state-of-the-art performance on TempEval-3 and TimeBank-Dense
    data. Although causal relations are much sparser than temporal ones, the architecture
    and the selected features are mostly suitable to serve both tasks. The effects
    of the interaction between the temporal and the causal components, although limited,
    yield promising results and confirm the tight connection between the temporal
    and the causal dimension of texts.

  abstract: "Because of the increasing popularity of social media, much information\
    \ has been shared on the internet, enabling social media users to understand various\
    \ real world events. Particularly, social media-based infectious disease surveillance\
    \ has attracted increasing attention. In this work, we specifically examine influenza:\
    \ a common topic of communication on social media. The fundamental theory of this\
    \ work is that several words, such as symptom words (fever, headache, etc.), appear\
    \ in advance of flu epidemic occurrence. Consequently, past word occurrence can\
    \ contribute to estimation of the number of current patients. To employ such forecasting\
    \ words, one can first estimate the optimal time lag for each word based on their\
    \ cross correlation. Then one can build a linear model consisting of word frequencies\
    \ at different time points for nowcasting and for forecasting influenza epidemics.\
    \ Experimentally obtained results (using 7.7 million tweets of August 2012 \u2013\
    \ January 2016), the proposed model achieved the best nowcasting performance to\
    \ date (correlation ratio 0.93) and practically sufficient forecasting performance\
    \ (correlation ratio 0.91 in 1-week future prediction, and correlation ratio 0.77\
    \ in 3-weeks future prediction). This report is the first of the relevant literature\
    \ to describe a model enabling prediction of future epidemics using Twitter."

  abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is a foundational NLP task and can be
    used in a wide range of tasks. To determine the STS of two texts, hundreds of
    different STS systems exist, however, for an NLP system designer, it is hard to
    decide which system is the best one. To answer this question, an intrinsic evaluation
    of the STS systems is conducted by comparing the output of the system to human
    judgments on semantic similarity. The comparison is usually done using Pearson
    correlation. In this work, we show that relying on intrinsic evaluations with
    Pearson correlation can be misleading. In three common STS based tasks we could
    observe that the Pearson correlation was especially ill-suited to detect the best
    STS system for the task and other evaluation measures were much better suited.
    In this work we define how the validity of an intrinsic evaluation can be assessed
    and compare different intrinsic evaluation methods. Understanding of the properties
    of the targeted task is crucial and we propose a framework for conducting the
    intrinsic evaluation which takes the properties of the targeted task into account.

  abstract: Princeton WordNet is one of the most important resources for natural language
    processing, but is only available for English. While it has been translated using
    the expand approach to many other languages, this is an expensive manual process.
    Therefore it would be beneficial to have a high-quality automatic translation
    approach that would support NLP techniques, which rely on WordNet in new languages.
    The translation of wordnets is fundamentally complex because of the need to translate
    all senses of a word including low frequency senses, which is very challenging
    for current machine translation approaches. For this reason we leverage existing
    translations of WordNet in other languages to identify contextual information
    for wordnet senses from a large set of generic parallel corpora. We evaluate our
    approach using 10 translated wordnets for European languages. Our experiment shows
    a significant improvement over translation without any contextual information.
    Furthermore, we evaluate how the choice of pivot languages affects performance
    of multilingual word sense disambiguation.

  abstract: 'Interlingua based Machine Translation (MT) aims to encode multiple languages
    into a common linguistic representation and then decode sentences in multiple
    target languages from this representation. In this work we explore this idea in
    the context of neural encoder decoder architectures, albeit on a smaller scale
    and without MT as the end goal. Specifically, we consider the case of three languages
    or modalities X, Z and Y wherein we are interested in generating sequences in
    Y starting from information available in X. However, there is no parallel training
    data available between X and Y but, training data is available between X & Z and
    Z & Y (as is often the case in many real world applications). Z thus acts as a
    pivot/bridge. An obvious solution, which is perhaps less elegant but works very
    well in practice is to train a two stage model which first converts from X to
    Z and then from Z to Y. Instead we explore an interlingua inspired solution which
    jointly learns to do the following (i) encode X and Z to a common representation
    and (ii) decode Y from this common representation. We evaluate our model on two
    tasks: (i) bridge transliteration and (ii) bridge captioning. We report promising
    results in both these applications and believe that this is a right step towards
    truly interlingua inspired encoder decoder architectures.'

  abstract: This paper studies cross-lingual transfer for dependency parsing, focusing
    on very low-resource settings where delexicalized transfer is the only fully automatic
    option. We show how to boost parsing performance by rewriting the source sentences
    so as to better match the linguistic regularities of the target language. We contrast
    a data-driven approach with an approach relying on linguistically motivated rules
    automatically extracted from the World Atlas of Language Structures. Our findings
    are backed up by experiments involving 40 languages. They show that both approaches
    greatly outperform the baseline, the knowledge-driven method yielding the best
    accuracies, with average improvements of +2.9 UAS, and up to +90 UAS (absolute)
    on some frequent PoS configurations.

  abstract: Deceptive opinion spam detection has attracted significant attention from
    both business and research communities. Existing approaches are based on manual
    discrete features, which can capture linguistic and psychological cues. However,
    such features fail to encode the semantic meaning of a document from the discourse
    perspective, which limits the performance. In this paper, we empirically explore
    a neural network model to learn document-level representation for detecting deceptive
    opinion spam. In particular, given a document, the model learns sentence representations
    with a convolutional neural network, which are combined using a gated recurrent
    neural network with attention mechanism to model discourse information and yield
    a document vector. Finally, the document representation is used directly as features
    to identify deceptive opinion spam. Experimental results on three domains (Hotel,
    Restaurant, and Doctor) show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
    methods.

  abstract: Gaussian LDA integrates topic modeling with word embeddings by replacing
    discrete topic distribution over word types with multivariate Gaussian distribution
    on the embedding space. This can take semantic information of words into account.
    However, the Euclidean similarity used in Gaussian topics is not an optimal semantic
    measure for word embeddings. Acknowledgedly, the cosine similarity better describes
    the semantic relatedness between word embeddings. To employ the cosine measure
    and capture complex topic structure, we use von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture models
    to represent topics, and then develop a novel mix-vMF topic model (MvTM). Using
    public pre-trained word embeddings, we evaluate MvTM on three real-world data
    sets. Experimental results show that our model can discover more coherent topics
    than the state-of-the-art baseline models, and achieve competitive classification
    performance.

  abstract: This paper describes a Bayesian language model for predicting spontaneous
    utterances. People sometimes say unexpected words, such as fillers or hesitations,
    that cause the miss-prediction of words in normal N-gram models. Our proposed
    model considers mixtures of possible segmental contexts, that is, a kind of context-word
    selection. It can reduce negative effects caused by unexpected words because it
    represents conditional occurrence probabilities of a word as weighted mixtures
    of possible segmental contexts. The tuning of mixture weights is the key issue
    in this approach as the segment patterns becomes numerous, thus we resolve it
    by using Bayesian model. The generative process is achieved by combining the stick-breaking
    process and the process used in the variable order Pitman-Yor language model.
    Experimental evaluations revealed that our model outperformed contiguous N-gram
    models in terms of perplexity for noisy text including hesitations.

  abstract: Languages with rich morphology often introduce sparsity in language processing
    tasks. While morphological analyzers can reduce this sparsity by providing morpheme-level
    analyses for words, they will often introduce ambiguity by returning multiple
    analyses for the same surface form. The problem of disambiguating between these
    morphological parses is further complicated by the fact that a correct parse for
    a word is not only be dependent on the surface form but also on other words in
    its context. In this paper, we present a language-agnostic approach to morphological
    disambiguation. We address the problem of using context in morphological disambiguation
    by presenting several LSTM-based neural architectures that encode long-range surface-level
    and analysis-level contextual dependencies. We applied our approach to Turkish,
    Russian, and Arabic to compare effectiveness across languages, matching state-of-the-art
    results in two of the three languages. Our results also demonstrate that while
    context plays a role in learning how to disambiguate, the type and amount of context
    needed varies between languages.

  abstract: Existing asynchronous parallel learning methods are only for the sparse
    feature models, and they face new challenges for the dense feature models like
    neural networks (e.g., LSTM, RNN). The problem for dense features is that asynchronous
    parallel learning brings gradient errors derived from overwrite actions. We show
    that gradient errors are very common and inevitable. Nevertheless, our theoretical
    analysis shows that the learning process with gradient errors can still be convergent
    towards the optimum of objective functions for many practical applications. Thus,
    we propose a simple method AsynGrad for asynchronous parallel learning with gradient
    error. Base on various dense feature models (LSTM, dense-CRF) and various NLP
    tasks, experiments show that AsynGrad achieves substantial improvement on training
    speed, and without any loss on accuracy.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we empirically explore the effects of various kinds of
    skip connections in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate
    three kinds of skip connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) skip connections
    to the gates, (b) skip connections to the internal states and (c) skip connections
    to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that skip connections
    to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using
    gated identity functions as skip mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel
    skip connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models
    and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results

  abstract: Summarization aims to represent source documents by a shortened passage.
    Existing methods focus on the extraction of key information, but often neglect
    coherence. Hence the generated summaries suffer from a lack of readability. To
    address this problem, we have developed a graph-based method by exploring the
    links between text to produce coherent summaries. Our approach involves finding
    a sequence of sentences that best represent the key information in a coherent
    way. In contrast to the previous methods that focus only on salience, the proposed
    method addresses both coherence and informativeness based on textual linkages.
    We conduct experiments on the DUC2004 summarization task data set. A performance
    comparison reveals that the summaries generated by the proposed system achieve
    comparable results in terms of the ROUGE metric, and show improvements in readability
    by human evaluation.

  abstract: A key component in surface realization in natural language generation
    is to choose concrete syntactic relationships to express a target meaning. We
    develop a new method for syntactic choice based on learning a stochastic tree
    grammar in a neural architecture. This framework can exploit state-of-the-art
    methods for modeling word sequences and generalizing across vocabulary. We also
    induce embeddings to generalize over elementary tree structures and exploit a
    tree recurrence over the input structure to model long-distance influences between
    NLG choices. We evaluate the models on the task of linearizing unannotated dependency
    trees, documenting the contribution of our modeling techniques to improvements
    in both accuracy and run time.

  abstract: This paper studies the abstractive multi-document summarization for event-oriented
    news texts through event information extraction and abstract representation. Fine-grained
    event mentions and semantic relations between them are extracted to build a unified
    and connected event semantic link network, an abstract representation of source
    texts. A network reduction algorithm is proposed to summarize the most salient
    and coherent event information. New sentences with good linguistic quality are
    automatically generated and selected through sentences over-generation and greedy-selection
    processes. Experimental results on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets show that our
    system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive
    baselines under both pyramid and ROUGE evaluation metrics.

  abstract: "Extracting summaries via integer linear programming and submodularity\
    \ are popular and successful techniques in extractive multi-document summarization.\
    \ However, many interesting optimization objectives are neither submodular nor\
    \ factorizable into an integer linear program. We address this issue and present\
    \ a general optimization framework where any function of input documents and a\
    \ system summary can be plugged in. Our framework includes two kinds of summarizers\
    \ \u2013 one based on genetic algorithms, the other using a swarm intelligence\
    \ approach. In our experimental evaluation, we investigate the optimization of\
    \ two information-theoretic summary evaluation metrics and find that our framework\
    \ yields competitive results compared to several strong summarization baselines.\
    \ Our comparative analysis of the genetic and swarm summarizers reveals interesting\

  abstract: This paper presents a deep learning architecture for the semantic decoder
    component of a Statistical Spoken Dialogue System. In a slot-filling dialogue,
    the semantic decoder predicts the dialogue act and a set of slot-value pairs from
    a set of n-best hypotheses returned by the Automatic Speech Recognition. Most
    current models for spoken language understanding assume (i) word-aligned semantic
    annotations as in sequence taggers and (ii) delexicalisation, or a mapping of
    input words to domain-specific concepts using heuristics that try to capture morphological
    variation but that do not scale to other domains nor to language variation (e.g.,
    morphology, synonyms, paraphrasing ). In this work the semantic decoder is trained
    using unaligned semantic annotations and it uses distributed semantic representation
    learning to overcome the limitations of explicit delexicalisation. The proposed
    architecture uses a convolutional neural network for the sentence representation
    and a long-short term memory network for the context representation. Results are
    presented for the publicly available DSTC2 corpus and an In-car corpus which is
    similar to DSTC2 but has a significantly higher word error rate (WER).

  abstract: Predictive incremental parsing produces syntactic representations of sentences
    as they are produced, e.g. by typing or speaking. In order to generate connected
    parses for such unfinished sentences, upcoming word types can be hypothesized
    and structurally integrated with already realized words. For example, the presence
    of a determiner as the last word of a sentence prefix may indicate that a noun
    will appear somewhere in the completion of that sentence, and the determiner can
    be attached to the predicted noun. We combine the forward-looking parser predictions
    with backward-looking N-gram histories and analyze in a set of experiments the
    impact on language models, i.e. stronger discriminative power but also higher
    data sparsity. Conditioning N-gram models, MaxEnt models or RNN-LMs on parser
    predictions yields perplexity reductions of about 6%. Our method (a) retains online
    decoding capabilities and (b) incurs relatively little computational overhead
    which sets it apart from previous approaches that use syntax for language modeling.
    Our method is particularly attractive for modular systems that make use of a syntax
    parser anyway, e.g. as part of an understanding pipeline where predictive parsing
    improves language modeling at no additional cost.

  abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of disfluency detection using the
    encoder-decoder framework. We treat disfluency detection as a sequence-to-sequence
    problem and propose a neural attention-based model which can efficiently model
    the long-range dependencies between words and make the resulting sentence more
    likely to be grammatically correct. Our model firstly encode the source sentence
    with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) and then use the neural
    attention as a pointer to select an ordered sub sequence of the input as the output.
    Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art f-score of 86.7%
    on the commonly used English Switchboard test set. We also evaluate the performance
    of our model on the in-house annotated Chinese data and achieve a significantly
    higher f-score compared to the baseline of CRF-based approach.

  abstract: Sequence labeling architectures use word embeddings for capturing similarity,
    but suffer when handling previously unseen or rare words. We investigate character-level
    extensions to such models and propose a novel architecture for combining alternative
    word representations. By using an attention mechanism, the model is able to dynamically
    decide how much information to use from a word- or character-level component.
    We evaluated different architectures on a range of sequence labeling datasets,
    and character-level extensions were found to improve performance on every benchmark.
    In addition, the proposed attention-based architecture delivered the best results
    even with a smaller number of trainable parameters.

  abstract: Previous studies on Thai Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) mostly assumed
    sentence ends at a space disambiguation problem, which classified space either
    as an indicator for Sentence Boundary (SB) or non-Sentence Boundary (nSB). In
    this paper, we propose a word labeling approach which treats space as a normal
    word, and detects SB between any two words. This removes the restriction for SB
    to be oc-curred only at space and makes our system more robust for modern Thai
    writing. It is because in modern Thai writing, space is not consistently used
    to indicate SB. As syntactic information contributes to better SBD, we further
    propose a joint Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging and SBD framework based on Factorial
    Conditional Random Field (FCRF) model. We compare the performance of our proposed
    ap-proach with reported methods on ORCHID corpus. We also performed experiments
    of FCRF model on the TaLAPi corpus. The results show that the word labelling approach
    has better performance than pre-vious space-based classification approaches and
    FCRF joint model outperforms LCRF model in terms of SBD in all experiments.

  abstract: We propose a new approach to PoS tagging where in a first step, we assign
    a coarse-grained tag corresponding to the main syntactic category. Based on this
    high-precision decision, in the second step we utilize specially trained fine-grained
    models with heavily reduced decision complexity. By analyzing the system under
    oracle conditions, we show that there is a quite large potential for significantly
    outperforming a competitive baseline. When we take error-propagation from the
    coarse-grained tagging into account, our approach is on par with the state of
    the art. Our approach also allows tailoring the tagger towards recognizing single
    word classes which are of interest e.g. for researchers searching for specific
    phenomena in large corpora. In a case study, we significantly outperform a standard
    model that also makes use of the same optimizations.

  abstract: Development of hand crafted rule for syllabifying words of a language
    is an expensive task. This paper proposes several data-driven methods for automatic
    syllabification of words written in Manipuri language. Manipuri is one of the
    scheduled Indian languages. First, we propose a language-independent rule-based
    approach formulated using entropy based phonotactic segmentation. Second, we project
    the syllabification problem as a sequence labeling problem and investigate its
    effect using various sequence labeling approaches. Third, we combine the effect
    of sequence labeling and rule-based method and investigate the performance of
    the hybrid approach. From various experimental observations, it is evident that
    the proposed methods outperform the baseline rule-based method. The entropy based
    phonotactic segmentation provides a word accuracy of 96%, CRF (sequence labeling
    approach) provides 97% and hybrid approach provides 98% word accuracy.

  abstract: In the context of natural language processing, representation learning
    has emerged as a newly active research subject because of its excellent performance
    in many applications. Learning representations of words is a pioneering study
    in this school of research. However, paragraph (or sentence and document) embedding
    learning is more suitable/reasonable for some tasks, such as sentiment classification
    and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we are aware, there is only
    a dearth of research focusing on launching unsupervised paragraph embedding methods.
    Classic paragraph embedding methods infer the representation of a given paragraph
    by considering all of the words occurring in the paragraph. Consequently, those
    stop or function words that occur frequently may mislead the embedding learning
    process to produce a misty paragraph representation. Motivated by these observations,
    our major contributions are twofold. First, we propose a novel unsupervised paragraph
    embedding method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at not only
    distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but also excluding
    the general background information to produce a more informative low-dimensional
    vector representation for the paragraph. We evaluate the proposed EV model on
    benchmark sentiment classification and multi-document summarization tasks. The
    experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed
    embedding method. Second, in view of the increasing importance of spoken content
    processing, an extension of the EV model, named the denoising essence vector (D-EV)
    model, is proposed. The D-EV model not only inherits the advantages of the EV
    model but also can infer a more robust representation for a given spoken paragraph
    against imperfect speech recognition. The utility of the D-EV model is evaluated
    on a spoken document summarization task, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed
    embedding method in relation to several well-practiced and state-of-the-art summarization
    methods.

  abstract: This paper introduces a continuous system capable of automatically producing
    the most adequate speaking style to synthesize a desired target text. This is
    done thanks to a joint modeling of the acoustic and lexical parameters of the
    speaker models by adapting the CVSM projection of the training texts using MR-HMM
    techniques. As such, we consider that as long as sufficient variety in the training
    data is available, we should be able to model a continuous lexical space into
    a continuous acoustic space. The proposed continuous automatic text to speech
    system was evaluated by means of a perceptual evaluation in order to compare them
    with traditional approaches to the task. The system proved to be capable of conveying
    the correct expressiveness (average adequacy of 3.6) with an expressive strength
    comparable to oracle traditional expressive speech synthesis (average of 3.6)
    although with a drop in speech quality mainly due to the semi-continuous nature
    of the data (average quality of 2.9). This means that the proposed system is capable
    of improving traditional neutral systems without requiring any additional user
    interaction.

  abstract: "Speech prosody is known to be central in advanced communication technologies.\
    \ However, despite the advances of theoretical studies in speech prosody, so far,\
    \ no large scale prosody annotated resources that would facilitate empirical research\
    \ and the development of empirical computational approaches are available. This\
    \ is to a large extent due to the fact that current common prosody annotation\
    \ conventions offer a descriptive framework of intonation contours and phrasing\
    \ based on labels. This makes it difficult to reach a satisfactory inter-annotator\
    \ agreement during the annotation of gold standard annotations and, subsequently,\
    \ to create consistent large scale annotations. To address this problem, we present\
    \ an annotation schema for prominence and boundary labeling of prosodic phrases\
    \ based upon acoustic parameters and a tagger for prosody annotation at the prosodic\
    \ phrase level. Evaluation proves that inter-annotator agreement reaches satisfactory\
    \ values, from 0.60 to 0.80 Cohen\u2019s kappa, while the prosody tagger achieves\
    \ acceptable recall and f-measure figures for five spontaneous samples used in\
    \ the evaluation of monologue and dialogue formats in English and Spanish. The\
    \ work presented in this paper is a first step towards a semi-automatic acquisition\
    \ of large corpora for empirical prosodic analysis."

  abstract: 'In Computational Linguistics, Hindi and Urdu are not viewed as a monolithic
    entity and have received separate attention with respect to their text processing.
    From part-of-speech tagging to machine translation, models are separately trained
    for both Hindi and Urdu despite the fact that they represent the same language.
    The reasons mainly are their divergent literary vocabularies and separate orthographies,
    and probably also their political status and the social perception that they are
    two separate languages. In this article, we propose a simple but efficient approach
    to bridge the lexical and orthographic differences between Hindi and Urdu texts.
    With respect to text processing, addressing the differences between the Hindi
    and Urdu texts would be beneficial in the following ways: (a) instead of training
    separate models, their individual resources can be augmented to train single,
    unified models for better generalization, and (b) their individual text processing
    applications can be used interchangeably under varied resource conditions. To
    remove the script barrier, we learn accurate statistical transliteration models
    which use sentence-level decoding to resolve word ambiguity. Similarly, we learn
    cross-register word embeddings from the harmonized Hindi and Urdu corpora to nullify
    their lexical divergences. As a proof of the concept, we evaluate our approach
    on the Hindi and Urdu dependency parsing under two scenarios: (a) resource sharing,
    and (b) resource augmentation. We demonstrate that a neural network-based dependency
    parser trained on augmented, harmonized Hindi and Urdu resources performs significantly
    better than the parsing models trained separately on the individual resources.
    We also show that we can achieve near state-of-the-art results when the parsers
    are used interchangeably.'

  abstract: Syntax plays an important role in the task of predicting the semantic
    structure of a sentence. But syntactic phenomena such as alternations, control
    and raising tend to obfuscate the relation between syntax and semantics. In this
    paper we predict the semantic structure of a sentence using a deeper syntax than
    what is usually done. This deep syntactic representation abstracts away from purely
    syntactic phenomena and proposes a structural organization of the sentence that
    is closer to the semantic representation. Experiments conducted on a French corpus
    annotated with semantic frames showed that a semantic parser reaches better performances
    with such a deep syntactic input.

  abstract: We present a dependency to constituent tree conversion technique that
    aims to improve constituent parsing accuracies by leveraging dependency treebanks
    available in a wide variety in many languages. The technique works in two steps.
    First, a partial constituent tree is derived from a dependency tree with a very
    simple deterministic algorithm that is both language and dependency type independent.
    Second, a complete high accuracy constituent tree is derived with a constraint-based
    parser, which uses the partial constituent tree as external constraints. Evaluated
    on Section 22 of the WSJ Treebank, the technique achieves the state-of-the-art
    conversion F-score 95.6. When applied to English Universal Dependency treebank
    and German CoNLL2006 treebank, the converted treebanks added to the human-annotated
    constituent parser training corpus improve parsing F-scores significantly for
    both languages.

  abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) are pervasive in natural languages and often
    have both idiomatic and compositional readings, which leads to high syntactic
    ambiguity. We show that for some MWE types idiomatic readings are usually the
    correct ones. We propose a heuristic for an A* parser for Tree Adjoining Grammars
    which benefits from this knowledge by promoting MWE-oriented analyses. This strategy
    leads to a substantial reduction in the parsing search space in case of true positive
    MWE occurrences, while avoiding parsing failures in case of false positives.

  abstract: 'This work focuses on the development of linguistic analysis tools for
    resource-poor languages. We use a parallel corpus to produce a multilingual word
    representation based only on sentence level alignment. This representation is
    combined with the annotated source side (resource-rich language) of the parallel
    corpus to train text analysis tools for resource-poor languages. Our approach
    is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and has the following advantages:
    (a) it does not use word alignment information, (b) it does not assume any knowledge
    about foreign languages, which makes it applicable to a wide range of resource-poor
    languages, (c) it provides truly multilingual taggers. In a previous study, we
    proposed a method based on Simple RNN to automatically induce a Part-Of-Speech
    (POS) tagger. In this paper, we propose an improvement of our neural model. We
    investigate the Bidirectional RNN and the inclusion of external information (for
    instance low level information from Part-Of-Speech tags) in the RNN to train a
    more complex tagger (for instance, a multilingual super sense tagger). We demonstrate
    the validity and genericity of our method by using parallel corpora (obtained
    by manual or automatic translation). Our experiments are conducted to induce cross-lingual
    POS and super sense taggers.'

  abstract: 'Annotation projection is a practical method to deal with the low resource
    problem in incident languages (IL) processing. Previous methods on annotation
    projection mainly relied on word alignment results without any training process,
    which led to noise propagation caused by word alignment errors. In this paper,
    we focus on the named entity recognition (NER) task and propose a weakly-supervised
    framework to project entity annotations from English to IL through bitexts. Instead
    of directly relying on word alignment results, this framework combines advantages
    of rule-based methods and deep learning methods by implementing two steps: First,
    generates a high-confidence entity annotation set on IL side with strict searching
    methods; Second, uses this high-confidence set to weakly supervise the model training.
    The model is finally used to accomplish the projecting process. Experimental results
    on two low-resource ILs show that the proposed method can generate better annotations
    projected from English-IL parallel corpora. The performance of IL name tagger
    can also be improved significantly by training on the newly projected IL annotation
    set.'

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning archtecture which
    is highly efficient for sentiment analysis in resource-poor languages. We learn
    sentiment embedded vectors from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These
    are augmented to a set of optimized features selected through a multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) framework. The sentiment augmented optimized vector obtained
    at the end is used for the training of SVM for sentiment classification. We evaluate
    our proposed approach for coarse-grained (i.e. sentence level) as well as fine-grained
    (i.e. aspect level) sentiment analysis on four Hindi datasets covering varying
    domains. In order to show that our proposed method is generic in nature we also
    evaluate it on two benchmark English datasets. Evaluation shows that the results
    of the proposed method are consistent across all the datasets and often outperforms
    the state-of-art systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first
    attempt where such a deep learning model is used for less-resourced languages
    such as Hindi.

  abstract: In Sanskrit, the phonemes at the word boundaries undergo changes to form
    new phonemes through a process called as sandhi. A fused sentence can be segmented
    into multiple possible segmentations. We propose a word segmentation approach
    that predicts the most semantically valid segmentation for a given sentence. We
    treat the problem as a query expansion problem and use the path-constrained random
    walks framework to predict the correct segments.

  abstract: In this paper, we first build a manually annotated named entity corpus
    of Mongolian. Then, we propose three morphological processing methods and study
    comprehensive features, including syllable features, lexical features, context
    features, morphological features and semantic features in Mongolian named entity
    recognition. Moreover, we also evaluate the influence of word cluster features
    on the system and combine all features together eventually. The experimental result
    shows that segmenting each suffix into an individual token achieves better results
    than deleting suffixes or using the suffixes as feature. The system based on segmenting
    suffixes with all proposed features yields benchmark result of F-measure=84.65
    on this corpus.

  abstract: When making clinical decisions, practitioners need to rely on the most
    relevant evidence available. However, accessing a vast body of medical evidence
    and confronting with the issue of information overload can be challenging and
    time consuming. This paper proposes an effective summarizer for medical evidence
    by utilizing both UMLS and WordNet. Given a clinical query and a set of relevant
    abstracts, our aim is to generate a fluent, well-organized, and compact summary
    that answers the query. Analysis via ROUGE metrics shows that using WordNet as
    a general-purpose lexicon helps to capture the concepts not covered by the UMLS
    Metathesaurus, and hence significantly increases the performance. The effectiveness
    of our proposed approach is demonstrated by conducting a set of experiments over
    a specialized evidence-based medicine (EBM) corpus - which has been gathered and
    annotated for the purpose of biomedical text summarization.

  abstract: "In order to organize the large number of products listed in e-commerce\
    \ sites, each product is usually assigned to one of the multi-level categories\
    \ in the taxonomy tree. It is a time-consuming and difficult task for merchants\
    \ to select proper categories within thousands of options for the products they\
    \ sell. In this work, we propose an automatic classification tool to predict the\
    \ matching category for a given product title and description. We used a combination\
    \ of two different neural models, i.e., deep belief nets and deep autoencoders,\
    \ for both titles and descriptions. We implemented a selective reconstruction\
    \ approach for the input layer during the training of the deep neural networks,\
    \ in order to scale-out for large-sized sparse feature vectors. GPUs are utilized\
    \ in order to train neural networks in a reasonable time. We have trained our\
    \ models for around 150 million products with a taxonomy tree with at most 5 levels\
    \ that contains 28,338 leaf categories. Tests with millions of products show that\

  abstract: Product classification is the task of automatically predicting a taxonomy
    path for a product in a predefined taxonomy hierarchy given a textual product
    description or title. For efficient product classification we require a suitable
    representation for a document (the textual description of a product) feature vector
    and efficient and fast algorithms for prediction.To address the above challenges,
    we propose a new distributional semantics representation for document vector formation.
    We also develop a new two-level ensemble approach utilising (with respect to the
    taxonomy tree) path-wise, node-wise and depth-wise classifiers to reduce error
    in the final product classification task. Our experiments show the effectiveness
    of the distributional representation and the ensemble approach on data sets from
    a leading e-commerce platform and achieve improved results on various evaluation
    metrics compared to earlier approaches.

  abstract: Query relevance ranking and sentence saliency ranking are the two main
    tasks in extractive query-focused summarization. Previous supervised summarization
    systems often perform the two tasks in isolation. However, since reference summaries
    are the trade-off between relevance and saliency, using them as supervision, neither
    of the two rankers could be trained well. This paper proposes a novel summarization
    system called AttSum, which tackles the two tasks jointly. It automatically learns
    distributed representations for sentences as well as the document cluster. Meanwhile,
    it applies the attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of human
    behavior when a query is given. Extensive experiments are conducted on DUC query-focused
    summarization benchmark datasets. Without using any hand-crafted features, AttSum
    achieves competitive performance. We also observe that the sentences recognized
    to focus on the query indeed meet the query need.

  abstract: "A news article summary usually consists of 2-3 key sentences that reflect\
    \ the gist of that news article. In this paper we explore using public posts following\
    \ a new article to improve automatic summary generation for the news article.\
    \ We propose different approaches to incorporate information from public posts,\
    \ including using frequency information from the posts to re-estimate bigram weights\
    \ in the ILP-based summarization model and to re-weight a dependency tree edge\u2019\
    s importance for sentence compression, directly selecting sentences from posts\
    \ as the final summary, and finally a strategy to combine the summarization results\
    \ generated from news articles and posts. Our experiments on data collected from\
    \ Facebook show that relevant public posts provide useful information and can\
    \ be effectively leveraged to improve news article summarization results."

  abstract: "Abstractive summarisation is not yet common amongst today\u2019s deployed\
    \ and research systems. Most existing systems either extract sentences or compress\
    \ individual sentences. In this paper, we present a summariser that works by a\
    \ different paradigm. It is a further development of an existing summariser that\
    \ has an incremental, proposition-based content selection process but lacks a\
    \ natural language (NL) generator for the final output. Using an NL generator,\
    \ we can now produce the summary text to directly reflect the selected propositions.\
    \ Our evaluation compares textual quality of our system to the earlier preliminary\
    \ output method, and also uses ROUGE to compare to various summarisers that use\
    \ the traditional method of sentence extraction, followed by compression. Our\
    \ results suggest that cutting out the middle-man of sentence extraction can lead\
    \ to better abstractive summaries."

  abstract: We propose a method for learning semantic CCG parsers by projecting annotations
    via a parallel corpus. The method opens an avenue towards cheaply creating multilingual
    semantic parsers mapping open-domain text to formal meaning representations. A
    first cross-lingually learned Dutch (from English) semantic parser obtains f-scores
    ranging from 42.99% to 69.22% depending on the level of label informativity taken
    into account, compared to 58.40% to 78.88% for the underlying source-language
    system. These are promising numbers compared to state-of-the-art semantic parsing
    in open domains.

  abstract: "We propose a dependency parsing pipeline, in which the parsing of long-distance\
    \ projections and localized dependencies are explicitly decomposed at the input\
    \ level. A chosen baseline dependency parsing model performs only on \u2018carved\u2019\
    \ sequences at the second stage, which are transformed from coarse constituent\
    \ parsing outputs at the first stage. When k-best constituent parsing outputs\
    \ are kept, a third-stage is required to search for an optimal combination of\
    \ the overlapped dependency subtrees. In this sense, our dependency model is subtree-factored.\
    \ We explore alternative approaches for scoring subtrees, including feature-based\
    \ models as well as continuous representations. The search for optimal subset\
    \ to combine is formulated as an ILP problem. This framework especially benefits\
    \ the models poor on long sentences, generally improving baselines by 0.75-1.28\
    \ (UAS) on English, achieving comparable performance with high-order models but\
    \ faster. For Chinese, the most notable increase is as high as 3.63 (UAS) when\
    \ the proposed framework is applied to first-order parsing models."

  abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying and labeling predicate-argument
    structures in sentences with semantic frame and role labels. A known challenge
    in SRL is the large number of low-frequency exceptions in training data, which
    are highly context-specific and difficult to generalize. To overcome this challenge,
    we propose the use of instance-based learning that performs no explicit generalization,
    but rather extrapolates predictions from the most similar instances in the training
    data. We present a variant of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification with composite
    features to identify nearest neighbors for SRL. We show that high-quality predictions
    can be derived from a very small number of similar instances. In a comparative
    evaluation we experimentally demonstrate that our instance-based learning approach
    significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art systems on both in-domain and
    out-of-domain data, reaching F1-scores of 89,28% and 79.91% respectively.

  abstract: Keystroke dynamics have been extensively used in psycholinguistic and
    writing research to gain insights into cognitive processing. But do keystroke
    logs contain actual signal that can be used to learn better natural language processing
    models? We postulate that keystroke dynamics contain information about syntactic
    structure that can inform shallow syntactic parsing. To test this hypothesis,
    we explore labels derived from keystroke logs as auxiliary task in a multi-task
    bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM). Our results show promising results
    on two shallow syntactic parsing tasks, chunking and CCG supertagging. Our model
    is simple, has the advantage that data can come from distinct sources, and produces
    models that are significantly better than models trained on the text annotations
    alone.

  abstract: Compound words with unmarked word boundaries are problematic for many
    tasks in NLP and computational linguistics, including information extraction,
    machine translation, and syllabification. This paper introduces a simple, proof-of-concept
    language modeling approach to automatic compound segmentation, as applied to Finnish.
    This approach utilizes an off-the-shelf morphological analyzer to split training
    words into their constituent morphemes. A language model is subsequently trained
    on ngrams composed of morphemes, morpheme boundaries, and word boundaries. Linguistic
    constraints are then used to weed out phonotactically ill-formed segmentations,
    thereby allowing the language model to select the best grammatical segmentation.
    This approach achieves an accuracy of ~97%.

  abstract: "Knowledge embedding, which projects triples in a given knowledge base\
    \ to d-dimensional vectors, has attracted considerable research efforts recently.\
    \ Most existing approaches treat the given knowledge base as a set of triplets,\
    \ each of whose representation is then learned separately. However, as a fact,\
    \ triples are connected and depend on each other. In this paper, we propose a\
    \ graph aware knowledge embedding method (GAKE), which formulates knowledge base\
    \ as a directed graph, and learns representations for any vertices or edges by\
    \ leveraging the graph\u2019s structural information. We introduce three types\
    \ of graph context for embedding: neighbor context, path context, and edge context,\
    \ each reflects properties of knowledge from different perspectives. We also design\
    \ an attention mechanism to learn representative power of different vertices or\
    \ edges. To validate our method, we conduct several experiments on two tasks.\
    \ Experimental results suggest that our method outperforms several state-of-art\
    \ knowledge embedding models."

  abstract: For automatic chatting systems, it is indeed a great challenge to reply
    the given query considering the conversation history, rather than based on the
    query only. This paper proposes a deep neural network to address the context-aware
    response ranking problem by end-to-end learning, so as to help to select conversationally
    relevant candidate. By combining the multi-column convolutional layer and the
    recurrent layer, our model is able to model the semantics of the utterance sequence
    by grasping the semantic clue within the conversation, on the basis of the effective
    representation for each sentence. Especially, the network utilizes attention pooling
    to further emphasis the importance of essential words in conversations, thus the
    representations of contexts tend to be more meaningful and the performance of
    candidate ranking is notably improved. Meanwhile, due to the adoption of attention
    pooling, it is possible to visualize the semantic clues. The experimental results
    on the large amount of conversation data from social media have shown that our
    approach is promising for quantifying the conversational relevance of responses,
    and indicated its good potential for building practical IR based chat-bots.

  abstract: Besides providing the relevant information, amusing users has been an
    important role of the web. Many web sites provide serendipitous (unexpected but
    relevant) information to draw user traffic. In this paper, we study the representative
    scenario of mining an amusing quiz. An existing approach leverages a knowledge
    base to mine an unexpected property then find quiz questions on such property,
    based on prototype theory in cognitive science. However, existing deterministic
    model is vulnerable to noise in the knowledge base. Therefore, we instead propose
    to leverage probabilistic approach to build a prototype that can overcome noise.
    Our extensive empirical study shows that our approach not only significantly outperforms
    baselines by 0.06 in accuracy, and 0.11 in serendipity but also shows higher relevance
    than the traditional relevance-pursuing baseline using TF-IDF.

  abstract: "Personal writings have inspired researchers in the fields of linguistics\
    \ and psychology to study the relationship between language and culture to better\
    \ understand the psychology of people across different cultures. In this paper,\
    \ we explore this relation by developing cross-cultural word models to identify\
    \ words with cultural bias \u2013 i.e., words that are used in significantly different\
    \ ways by speakers from different cultures. Focusing specifically on two cultures:\
    \ United States and Australia, we identify a set of words with significant usage\
    \ differences, and further investigate these words through feature analysis and\
    \ topic modeling, shedding light on the attributes of language that contribute\
    \ to these differences."

  abstract: Cyberbullying statistics are shocking, the number of affected young people
    is increasing dramatically with the affordability of mobile technology devices
    combined with a growing number of social networks. This paper proposes a framework
    to analyse Tweets with the goal to identify cyberharassment in social networks
    as an important step to protect people from cyberbullying. The proposed framework
    incorporates latent or hidden variables with supervised learning to determine
    potential bullying cases resembling short blogging type texts such as Tweets.
    It uses the LIWC2007 - tool that translates Tweet messages into 67 numeric values,
    representing 67 word categories. The output vectors are then used as features
    for four different classifiers implemented in Weka. Tests on all four classifiers
    delivered encouraging predictive capability of Tweet messages. Overall it was
    found that the use of numeric psychometric values outperformed the same algorithms
    using both filtered and unfiltered words as features. The best performing algorithms
    was Random Forest with an F1-value of 0.947 using psychometric features compared
    to a value of 0.847 for the same algorithm using words as features.

  abstract: Learning syntactic categories is a fundamental task in language acquisition.
    Previous studies show that co-occurrence patterns of preceding and following words
    are essential to group words into categories. However, the neighboring words,
    or frames, are rarely repeated exactly in the data. This creates data sparsity
    and hampers learning for frame based models. In this work, we propose a paradigmatic
    representation of word context which uses probable substitutes instead of frames.
    Our experiments on child-directed speech show that models based on probable substitutes
    learn more accurate categories with fewer examples compared to models based on
    frames.

  abstract: "In this paper, we aim to investigate the coordination of interlocutors\
    \ behavior in different emotional segments. Conversational coordination between\
    \ the interlocutors is the tendency of speakers to predict and adjust each other\
    \ accordingly on an ongoing conversation. In order to find such a coordination,\
    \ we investigated 1) lexical similarities between the speakers in each emotional\
    \ segments, 2) correlation between the interlocutors using psycholinguistic features,\
    \ such as linguistic styles, psychological process, personal concerns among others,\
    \ and 3) relation of interlocutors turn-taking behaviors such as competitiveness.\
    \ To study the degree of coordination in different emotional segments, we conducted\
    \ our experiments using real dyadic conversations collected from call centers\
    \ in which agent\u2019s emotional state include empathy and customer\u2019s emotional\
    \ states include anger and frustration. Our findings suggest that the most coordination\
    \ occurs between the interlocutors inside anger segments, where as, a little coordination\
    \ was observed when the agent was empathic, even though an increase in the amount\
    \ of non-competitive overlaps was observed. We found no significant difference\
    \ between anger and frustration segment in terms of turn-taking behaviors. However,\
    \ the length of pause significantly decreases in the preceding segment of anger\
    \ where as it increases in the preceding segment of frustration."

  abstract: We propose a hierarchical clustering approach designed to group linguistic
    features for supervised machine learning that is inspired by variationist linguistics.
    The method makes it possible to abstract away from the individual feature occurrences
    by grouping features together that behave alike with respect to the target class,
    thus providing a new, more general perspective on the data. On the one hand, it
    reduces data sparsity, leading to quantitative performance gains. On the other,
    it supports the formation and evaluation of hypotheses about individual choices
    of linguistic structures. We explore the method using features based on verb subcategorization
    information and evaluate the approach in the context of the Native Language Identification
    (NLI) task.

  abstract: 'Previous linguistic research on scientific writing has shown that language
    use in the scientific domain varies considerably in register and style over time.
    In this paper we investigate the introduction of information theory inspired features
    to study long term diachronic change on three levels: lexis, part-of-speech and
    syntax. Our approach is based on distinguishing between sentences from 19th and
    20th century scientific abstracts using supervised classification models. To the
    best of our knowledge, the introduction of information theoretic features to this
    task is novel. We show that these features outperform more traditional features,
    such as token or character n-grams, while leading to more compact models. We present
    a detailed analysis of feature informativeness in order to gain a better understanding
    of diachronic change on different linguistic levels.'

  abstract: Recent work for learning word representations has applied successfully
    to many NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis and question answering. However,
    most of these models assume a single vector per word type without considering
    polysemy and homonymy. In this paper, we present an extension to the CBOW model
    which not only improves the quality of embeddings but also makes embeddings suitable
    for polysemy. It differs from most of the related work in that it learns one semantic
    center embedding and one context bias instead of training multiple embeddings
    per word type. Different context leads to different bias which is defined as the
    weighted average embeddings of local context. Experimental results on similarity
    task and analogy task show that the word representations learned by the proposed
    method outperform the competitive baselines.

  abstract: In this work we tackle the challenge of identifying rhythmic patterns
    in poetry written in English. Although poetry is a literary form that makes use
    standard meters usually repeated among different authors, we will see in this
    paper how performing such analyses is a difficult task in machine learning due
    to the unexpected deviations from such standard patterns. After breaking down
    some examples of classical poetry, we apply a number of NLP techniques for the
    scansion of poetry, training and testing our systems against a human-annotated
    corpus. With these experiments, our purpose is establish a baseline of automatic
    scansion of poetry using NLP tools in a straightforward manner and to raise awareness
    of the difficulties of this task.

  abstract: "In order to apply computational linguistic analyses and pass information\
    \ to downstream applications, transcriptions of speech obtained via automatic\
    \ speech recognition (ASR) need to be divided into smaller meaningful units, in\
    \ a task we refer to as \u2018speech-unit (SU) delimitation\u2019. We closely\
    \ recreate the automatic delimitation system described by Lee and Glass (2012),\
    \ \u2018Sentence detection using multiple annotations\u2019, Proceedings of INTERSPEECH,\
    \ which combines a prosodic model, language model and speech-unit length model\
    \ in log-linear fashion. Since state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)\
    \ tools have been developed to deal with written text and its characteristic sentence-like\
    \ units, SU delimitation helps bridge the gap between ASR and NLP, by normalising\
    \ spoken data into a more canonical format. Previous work has focused on native\
    \ speaker recordings; we test the system of Lee and Glass (2012) on non-native\
    \ speaker (or \u2018learner\u2019) data, achieving performance above the state-of-the-art.\

  abstract: Parallelism is an important rhetorical device. We propose a machine learning
    approach for automated sentence parallelism identification in student essays.
    We build an essay dataset with sentence level parallelism annotated. We derive
    features by combining generalized word alignment strategies and the alignment
    measures between word sequences. The experimental results show that sentence parallelism
    can be effectively identified with a F1 score of 82% at pair-wise level and 72%
    at parallelism chunk level.Based on this approach, we automatically identify sentence
    parallelism in more than 2000 student essays and study the correlation between
    the use of sentence parallelism and the types and quality of essays.

  abstract: In this paper we analyze the effectiveness of using linguistic knowledge
    from coreference and anaphora resolution for improving the performance for supervised
    keyphrase extraction. In order to verify the impact of these features, we define
    a baseline keyphrase extraction system and evaluate its performance on a standard
    dataset using different machine learning algorithms. Then, we consider new sets
    of features by adding combinations of the linguistic features we propose and we
    evaluate the new performance of the system. We also use anaphora and coreference
    resolution to transform the documents, trying to simulate the cohesion process
    performed by the human mind. We found that our approach has a slightly positive
    impact on the performance of automatic keyphrase extraction, in particular when
    considering the ranking of the results.

  abstract: Finding authentic examples of grammatical constructions is central in
    constructionist approaches to linguistics, language processing, and second language
    learning. In this paper, we address this problem as an information retrieval (IR)
    task. To facilitate research in this area, we built a benchmark collection by
    annotating the occurrences of six constructions in a Swedish corpus. Furthermore,
    we implemented a simple and flexible retrieval system for finding construction
    occurrences, in which the user specifies a ranking function using lexical-semantic
    similarities (lexicon-based or distributional). The system was evaluated using
    standard IR metrics on the new benchmark, and we saw that lexical-semantical rerankers
    improve significantly over a purely surface-oriented system, but must be carefully
    tailored for each individual construction.

  abstract: We propose a new method of automatically extracting learner errors from
    parallel English as a Second Language (ESL) sentences in an effort to regularise
    annotation formats and reduce inconsistencies. Specifically, given an original
    and corrected sentence, our method first uses a linguistically enhanced alignment
    algorithm to determine the most likely mappings between tokens, and secondly employs
    a rule-based function to decide which alignments should be merged. Our method
    beats all previous approaches on the tested datasets, achieving state-of-the-art
    results for automatic error extraction.

  abstract: "Linguistic typology provides features that have a potential of uncovering\
    \ deep phylogenetic relations among the world\u2019s languages. One of the key\
    \ challenges in using typological features for phylogenetic inference is that\
    \ horizontal (spatial) transmission obscures vertical (phylogenetic) signals.\
    \ In this paper, we characterize typological features with respect to the relative\
    \ strength of vertical and horizontal transmission. To do this, we first construct\
    \ (1) a spatial neighbor graph of languages and (2) a phylogenetic neighbor graph\
    \ by collapsing known language families. We then develop an autologistic model\
    \ that predicts a feature\u2019s distribution from these two graphs. In the experiments,\
    \ we managed to separate vertically and/or horizontally stable features from unstable\
    \ ones, and the results are largely consistent with previous findings."

  abstract: "The modifications that foreign loanwords undergo when adapted into Japanese\
    \ have been the subject of much study in linguistics. The scholarly interest of\
    \ the topic can be attributed to the fact that Japanese loanwords undergo a complex\
    \ series of phonological adaptations, something which has been puzzling scholars\
    \ for decades. While previous studies of Japanese loanword accommodation have\
    \ focused on specific phonological phenomena of limited scope, the current study\
    \ leverages computational methods to provide a more complete description of all\
    \ the sound changes that occur when adopting English words into Japanese. To investigate\
    \ this, we have developed a parallel corpus of 250 English transcriptions and\
    \ their respective Japanese equivalents. These words were then used to develop\
    \ a wide-coverage finite state transducer based phonological grammar that mimics\
    \ the behavior of the Japanese adaption process. By developing rules with the\
    \ goal of accounting completely for a large number of borrowing and analyzing\
    \ forms mistakenly generated by the system, we discovered an internal inconsistency\
    \ inside the loanword phonology of the Japanese language, something arguably underestimated\
    \ by previous studies. The result of the investigation suggests that there are\
    \ multiple \u2018dimensions\u2019 that shape the output form of the current Japanese\
    \ loanwords. These dimensions include orthography, phonetics, and historical changes."

  abstract: We present a linguistic analysis of a set of English and Spanish verb+noun
    combinations (VNCs), and a method to use this information to improve VNC identification.
    Firstly, a sample of frequent VNCs are analysed in-depth and tagged along lexico-semantic
    and morphosyntactic dimensions, obtaining satisfactory inter-annotator agreement
    scores. Then, a VNC identification experiment is undertaken, where the analysed
    linguistic data is combined with chunking information and syntactic dependencies.
    A comparison between the results of the experiment and the results obtained by
    a basic detection method shows that VNC identification can be greatly improved
    by using linguistic information, as a large number of additional occurrences are
    detected with high precision.

  abstract: We study the problem of detecting sentences describing adverse drug reactions
    (ADRs) and frame the problem as binary classification. We investigate different
    neural network (NN) architectures for ADR classification. In particular, we propose
    two new neural network models, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) by
    concatenating convolutional neural networks with recurrent neural networks, and
    Convolutional Neural Network with Attention (CNNA) by adding attention weights
    into convolutional neural networks. We evaluate various NN architectures on a
    Twitter dataset containing informal language and an Adverse Drug Effects (ADE)
    dataset constructed by sampling from MEDLINE case reports. Experimental results
    show that all the NN architectures outperform the traditional maximum entropy
    classifiers trained from n-grams with different weighting strategies considerably
    on both datasets. On the Twitter dataset, all the NN architectures perform similarly.
    But on the ADE dataset, CNN performs better than other more complex CNN variants.
    Nevertheless, CNNA allows the visualisation of attention weights of words when
    making classification decisions and hence is more appropriate for the extraction
    of word subsequences describing ADRs.

  abstract: Misuse of Chinese prepositions is one of common word usage errors in grammatical
    error diagnosis. In this paper, we adopt the Chinese Gigaword corpus and HSK corpus
    as L1 and L2 corpora, respectively. We explore gated recurrent neural network
    model (GRU), and an ensemble of GRU model and maximum entropy language model (GRU-ME)
    to select the best preposition from 43 candidates for each test sentence. The
    experimental results show the advantage of the GRU models over simple RNN and
    n-gram models. We further analyze the effectiveness of linguistic information
    such as word boundary and part-of-speech tag in this task.

  abstract: We describe and evaluate a character-level tagger for language-independent
    Named Entity Recognition (NER). Instead of words, a sentence is represented as
    a sequence of characters. The model consists of stacked bidirectional LSTMs which
    inputs characters and outputs tag probabilities for each character. These probabilities
    are then converted to consistent word level named entity tags using a Viterbi
    decoder. We are able to achieve close to state-of-the-art NER performance in seven
    languages with the same basic model using only labeled NER data and no hand-engineered
    features or other external resources like syntactic taggers or Gazetteers.

  abstract: Historical texts are challenging for natural language processing because
    they differ linguistically from modern texts and because of their lack of orthographical
    and grammatical standardisation. We use a character-level neural network to build
    a part-of-speech (POS) tagger that can process historical data directly without
    requiring a separate spelling normalisation stage. Its performance in a Swedish
    verb identification and a German POS tagging task is similar to that of a two-stage
    model. We analyse the performance of this tagger and a more traditional baseline
    system, discuss some of the remaining problems for tagging historical data and
    suggest how the flexibility of our neural tagger could be exploited to address
    diachronic divergences in morphology and syntax in early modern Swedish with the
    help of data from closely related languages.

  abstract: The goal of keyphrase extraction is to automatically identify the most
    salient phrases from documents. The technique has a wide range of applications
    such as rendering a quick glimpse of a document, or extracting key content for
    further use. While previous work often assumes keyphrases are a static property
    of a given documents, in many applications, the appropriate set of keyphrases
    that should be extracted depends on the set of documents that are being considered
    together. In particular, good keyphrases should not only accurately describe the
    content of a document, but also reveal what discriminates it from the other documents.
    In this paper, we study this problem of extracting discriminative keyphrases.
    In particularly, we propose to use the hierarchical semantic structure between
    candidate keyphrases to promote keyphrases that have the right level of specificity
    to clearly distinguish the target document from others. We show that such knowledge
    can be used to construct better discriminative keyphrase extraction systems that
    do not assume a static, fixed set of keyphrases for a document. We show how this
    helps identify key expertise of authors from their papers, as well as competencies
    covered by online courses within different domains.

  abstract: On microblogging services, people usually use hashtags to mark microblogs,
    which have a specific theme or content, making them easier for users to find.
    Hence, how to automatically recommend hashtags for microblogs has received much
    attention in recent years. Previous deep neural network-based hashtag recommendation
    approaches converted the task into a multi-class classification problem. However,
    most of these methods only took the microblog itself into consideration. Motivated
    by the intuition that the history of users should impact the recommendation procedure,
    in this work, we extend end-to-end memory networks to perform this task. We incorporate
    the histories of users into the external memory and introduce a hierarchical attention
    mechanism to select more appropriate histories. To train and evaluate the proposed
    method, we also construct a dataset based on microblogs collected from Twitter.
    Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly outperform
    state-of-the-art methods. By incorporating the hierarchical attention mechanism,
    the relative improvement in the proposed method over the state-of-the-art method
    is around 67.9% in the F1-score.

  abstract: Topics generated by topic models are typically represented as list of
    terms. To reduce the cognitive overhead of interpreting these topics for end-users,
    we propose labelling a topic with a succinct phrase that summarises its theme
    or idea. Using Wikipedia document titles as label candidates, we compute neural
    embeddings for documents and words to select the most relevant labels for topics.
    Comparing to a state-of-the-art topic labelling system, our methodology is simpler,
    more efficient and finds better topic labels.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a new memory-bounded left-corner parsing model for
    unsupervised raw-text syntax induction, using unsupervised hierarchical hidden
    Markov models (UHHMM). We deploy this algorithm to shed light on the extent to
    which human language learners can discover hierarchical syntax through distributional
    statistics alone, by modeling two widely-accepted features of human language acquisition
    and sentence processing that have not been simultaneously modeled by any existing
    grammar induction algorithm: (1) a left-corner parsing strategy and (2) limited
    working memory capacity. To model realistic input to human language learners,
    we evaluate our system on a corpus of child-directed speech rather than typical
    newswire corpora. Results beat or closely match those of three competing systems.'

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the annotation projection of semantic units
    in a practical setting. Previous approaches have focused on using parallel corpora
    for semantic transfer. We evaluate an alternative approach using loosely parallel
    corpora that does not require the corpora to be exact translations of each other.
    We developed a method that transfers semantic annotations from one language to
    another using sentences aligned by entities, and we extended it to include alignments
    by entity-like linguistic units. We conducted our experiments on a large scale
    using the English, Swedish, and French language editions of Wikipedia. Our results
    show that the annotation projection using entities in combination with loosely
    parallel corpora provides a viable approach to extending previous attempts. In
    addition, it allows the generation of proposition banks upon which semantic parsers
    can be trained.

    and language relatedness from raw words for cognate identification. Compared to
    previous works, we train and test on larger and realistic datasets; and, show
    that siamese architectures consistently perform better than traditional linear

  abstract: This paper investigates differential topic models (dTM) for summarizing
    the differences among document groups. Starting from a simple probabilistic generative
    model, we propose dTM-SAGE that explicitly models the deviations on group-specific
    word distributions to indicate how words are used differen-tially across different
    document groups from a background word distribution. It is more effective to capture
    unique characteristics for comparing document groups. To generate dTM-based comparative
    summaries, we propose two sentence scoring methods for measuring the sentence
    discriminative capacity. Experimental results on scientific papers dataset show
    that our dTM-based comparative summari-zation methods significantly outperform
    the generic baselines and the state-of-the-art comparative summarization methods
    under ROUGE metrics.

  abstract: "Coherent extracts are a novel type of summary combining the advantages\
    \ of manually created abstractive summaries, which are fluent but difficult to\
    \ evaluate, and low-quality automatically created extractive summaries, which\
    \ lack coherence and structure. We use a corpus of heterogeneous documents to\
    \ address the issue that information seekers usually face \u2013 a variety of\
    \ different types of information sources. We directly extract information from\
    \ these, but minimally redact and meaningfully order it to form a coherent text.\
    \ Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that quantitative results\
    \ are not sufficient to judge the quality of a summary and that other quality\
    \ criteria, such as coherence, should also be taken into account. We find that\
    \ our manually created corpus is of high quality and that it has the potential\
    \ to bridge the gap between reference corpora of abstracts and automatic methods\
    \ producing extracts. Our corpus is available to the research community for further\
    \ development."

  abstract: "Chinese poetry generation is a very challenging task in natural language\
    \ processing. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage poetry generating method\
    \ which first plans the sub-topics of the poem according to the user\u2019s writing\
    \ intent, and then generates each line of the poem sequentially, using a modified\
    \ recurrent neural network encoder-decoder framework. The proposed planning-based\
    \ method can ensure that the generated poem is coherent and semantically consistent\
    \ with the user\u2019s intent. A comprehensive evaluation with human judgments\
    \ demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poetry\
    \ generating methods and the poem quality is somehow comparable to human poets."

  abstract: We examine the task of aggregation in the context of text-to-text generation.
    We introduce a new aggregation task which frames the process as grouping input
    sentence fragments into clusters that are to be expressed as a single output sentence.
    We extract datasets for this task from a corpus using an automatic extraction
    process. Based on the results of a user study, we develop two gold-standard clusterings
    and corresponding evaluation methods for each dataset. We present a hierarchical
    clustering framework for predicting aggregation decisions on this task, which
    outperforms several baselines and can serve as a reference in future work.

  abstract: Unexpected events such as accidents, natural disasters and terrorist attacks
    represent an information situation where it is crucial to give users access to
    important and non-redundant information as early as possible. Incremental update
    summarization (IUS) aims at summarizing events which develop over time. In this
    paper, we propose a combination of sequential clustering and contextual importance
    measures to identify important sentences in a stream of documents in a timely
    manner. Sequential clustering is used to cluster similar sentences. The created
    clusters are scored by a contextual importance measure which identifies important
    information as well as redundant information. Experiments on the TREC Temporal
    Summarization 2015 shared task dataset show that our system achieves superior
    results compared to the best participating systems.

  abstract: "Recently Wen et al. (2015) have proposed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\
    \ approach to the generation of utterances from dialog acts, and shown that although\
    \ their model requires less effort to develop than a rule-based system, it is\
    \ able to improve certain aspects of the utterances, in particular their naturalness.\
    \ However their system employs generation at the word-level, which requires one\
    \ to pre-process the data by substituting named entities with placeholders. This\
    \ pre-processing prevents the model from handling some contextual effects and\
    \ from managing multiple occurrences of the same attribute. Our approach uses\
    \ a character-level model, which unlike the word-level model makes it possible\
    \ to learn to \u201Ccopy\u201D information from the dialog act to the target without\
    \ having to pre-process the input. In order to avoid generating non-words and\
    \ inventing information not present in the input, we propose a method for incorporating\
    \ prior knowledge into the RNN in the form of a weighted finite-state automaton\
    \ over character sequences. Automatic and human evaluations show improved performance\
    \ over baselines on several evaluation criteria."

  abstract: Readers usually rely on abstracts to identify relevant medical information
    from scientific articles. Abstracts are also essential to advanced information
    retrieval methods. More than 50 thousand scientific publications in PubMed lack
    author-generated abstracts, and the relevancy judgements for these papers have
    to be based on their titles alone. In this paper, we propose a hybrid summarization
    technique that aims to select the most pertinent sentences from articles to generate
    an extractive summary in lieu of a missing abstract. We combine i) health outcome
    detection, ii) keyphrase extraction, and iii) textual entailment recognition between
    sentences. We evaluate our hybrid approach and analyze the improvements of multi-factor
    summarization over techniques that rely on a single method, using a collection
    of 295 manually generated reference summaries. The obtained results show that
    the hybrid approach outperforms the baseline techniques with an improvement of
    13% in recall and 4% in F1 score.

  abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is the task of generating natural language
    from a meaning representation. Current rule-based approaches require domain-specific
    and manually constructed linguistic resources, while most machine-learning based
    approaches rely on aligned training data and/or phrase templates. The latter are
    needed to restrict the search space for the structured prediction task defined
    by the unaligned datasets. In this work we propose the use of imitation learning
    for structured prediction which learns an incremental model that handles the large
    search space by avoiding explicit enumeration of the outputs. We focus on the
    Locally Optimal Learning to Search framework which allows us to train against
    non-decomposable loss functions such as the BLEU or ROUGE scores while not assuming
    gold standard alignments. We evaluate our approach on three datasets using both
    automatic measures and human judgements and achieve results comparable to the
    state-of-the-art approaches developed for each of them.

  abstract: We propose a phrase-based approach for generating product review summaries.
    The main idea of our method is to leverage phrase properties to choose a subset
    of optimal phrases for generating the final summary. Specifically, we exploit
    two phrase properties, popularity and specificity. Popularity describes how popular
    the phrase is in the original reviews. Specificity describes how descriptive a
    phrase is in comparison to generic comments. We formalize the phrase selection
    procedure as an optimization problem and solve it using integer linear programming
    (ILP). An aspect-based bigram language model is used for generating the final
    summary with the selected phrases. Experiments show that our summarizer outperforms
    the other baselines.

  abstract: We present a novel approach to automated question generation that improves
    upon prior work both from a technology perspective and from an assessment perspective.
    Our system is aimed at engaging language learners by generating multiple-choice
    questions which utilize specific inference steps over multiple sentences, namely
    coreference resolution and paraphrase detection. The system also generates correct
    answers and semantically-motivated phrase-level distractors as answer choices.
    Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our approach requires a larger number
    of inference steps, which necessitate deeper semantic understanding of texts than
    a traditional single-sentence approach.

  abstract: Despite the growing number of Computational Construction Grammar implementations,
    the field is still lacking evaluation methods to compare grammar fragments across
    different platforms. Moreover, the hand-crafted nature of most grammars requires
    profiling tools to understand the complex interactions between constructions of
    different types. This paper presents a number of evaluation measures, partially
    based on existing measures in the field of semantic parsing, that are especially
    relevant for reversible grammar formalisms. The measures are tested on a grammar
    fragment for European Portuguese clitic placement that is currently under development.

  abstract: Methods for text simplification using the framework of statistical machine
    translation have been extensively studied in recent years. However, building the
    monolingual parallel corpus necessary for training the model requires costly human
    annotation. Monolingual parallel corpora for text simplification have therefore
    been built only for a limited number of languages, such as English and Portuguese.
    To obviate the need for human annotation, we propose an unsupervised method that
    automatically builds the monolingual parallel corpus for text simplification using
    sentence similarity based on word embeddings. For any sentence pair comprising
    a complex sentence and its simple counterpart, we employ a many-to-one method
    of aligning each word in the complex sentence with the most similar word in the
    simple sentence and compute sentence similarity by averaging these word similarities.
    The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed
    method in a monolingual parallel corpus construction task for English text simplification.
    The results also demonstrated the superior accuracy in text simplification that
    use the framework of statistical machine translation trained using the corpus
    built by the proposed method to that using the existing corpora.

  abstract: 'This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and
    distributed representations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation
    (MT). This study is made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation
    metric: METEOR. METEOR enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological
    similarity) between an automatic and a reference translation. Our experiments
    are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014. We show that distributed
    representations are a good alternative to lexico-semanticresources for MT evaluation
    and they can even bring interesting additional information. The augmented versions
    of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our Github page.'

  abstract: "One of the main obstacles, hampering method development and comparative\
    \ evaluation of named entity recognition in social media, is the lack of a sizeable,\
    \ diverse, high quality annotated corpus, analogous to the CoNLL\u20192003 news\
    \ dataset. For instance, the biggest Ritter tweet corpus is only 45,000 tokens\
    \ \u2013 a mere 15% the size of CoNLL\u20192003. Another major shortcoming is\
    \ the lack of temporal, geographic, and author diversity. This paper introduces\
    \ the Broad Twitter Corpus (BTC), which is not only significantly bigger, but\
    \ sampled across different regions, temporal periods, and types of Twitter users.\
    \ The gold-standard named entity annotations are made by a combination of NLP\
    \ experts and crowd workers, which enables us to harness crowd recall while maintaining\
    \ high quality. We also measure the entity drift observed in our dataset (i.e.\
    \ how entity representation varies over time), and compare to newswire. The corpus\
    \ is released openly, including source text and intermediate annotations."

  abstract: Semantic text processing faces the challenge of defining the relation
    between lexical expressions and the world to which they make reference within
    a period of time. It is unclear whether the current test sets used to evaluate
    disambiguation tasks are representative for the full complexity considering this
    time-anchored relation, resulting in semantic overfitting to a specific period
    and the frequent phenomena within. We conceptualize and formalize a set of metrics
    which evaluate this complexity of datasets. We provide evidence for their applicability
    on five different disambiguation tasks. To challenge semantic overfitting of disambiguation
    systems, we propose a time-based, metric-aware method for developing datasets
    in a systematic and semi-automated manner, as well as an event-based QA task.

  abstract: There are growing needs for patent analysis using Natural Language Processing
    (NLP)-based approaches. Although NLP-based approaches can extract various information
    from patents, there are very few approaches proposed to extract those parts what
    inventors regard as novel or having an inventive step compared to all existing
    works ever. To extract such parts is difficult even for human annotators except
    for well-trained experts. This causes many difficulties in analyzing patents.
    We propose a novel approach to automatically extract such keywords that relate
    to novelties or inventive steps from patent claims using the structure of the
    claims. In addition, we also propose a new framework of evaluating our approach.
    The experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing keyword extraction
    methods significantly in many technical fields.

  abstract: Event extraction has become one of the most important topics in information
    extraction, but to date, there is very limited work on leveraging cross-lingual
    training to boost performance. We propose a new event extraction approach that
    trains on multiple languages using a combination of both language-dependent and
    language-independent features, with particular focus on the case where target
    domain training data is of very limited size. We show empirically that multilingual
    training can boost performance for the tasks of event trigger extraction and event
    argument extraction on the Chinese ACE 2005 dataset.

    level unigram language models to train a conditional random fields (CRF) model
    for classifying input words into various languages. We test our proposed framework
    and compare it to the state-of-the-art published systems on standard data sets
    from several language pairs: English-Spanish, Nepali-English, English-Hindi, Arabizi
    (Refers to Arabic written using the Latin/Roman script)-English, Arabic-Engari
    (Refers to English written using Arabic script), Modern Standard Arabic(MSA)-Egyptian,
    Levantine-MSA, Gulf-MSA, one more English-Spanish, and one more MSA-EGY. The overall
    weighted average F-score of each language pair are 96.4%, 97.3%, 98.0%, 97.0%,
    98.9%, 86.3%, 88.2%, 90.6%, 95.2%, and 85.0% respectively. The results show that

  abstract: In community question answering (cQA), the quality of answers are determined
    by the matching degree between question-answer pairs and the correlation among
    the answers. In this paper, we show that the dependency between the answer quality
    labels also plays a pivotal role. To validate the effectiveness of label dependency,
    we propose two neural network-based models, with different combination modes of
    Convolutional Neural Net-works, Long Short Term Memory and Conditional Random
    Fields. Extensive experi-ments are taken on the dataset released by the SemEval-2015
    cQA shared task. The first model is a stacked ensemble of the networks. It achieves
    58.96% on macro averaged F1, which improves the state-of-the-art neural network-based
    method by 2.82% and outper-forms the Top-1 system in the shared task by 1.77%.
    The second is a simple attention-based model whose input is the connection of
    the question and its corresponding answers. It produces promising results with
    58.29% on overall F1 and gains the best performance on the Good and Bad categories.

  abstract: Identification of Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) lies at the heart of many
    natural language processing applications. In this research, we deal with a particular
    type of Hebrew MWEs, Verb-Noun MWEs (VN-MWEs), which combine a verb and a noun
    with or without other words. Most prior work on MWEs classification focused on
    linguistic and statistical information. In this paper, we claim that it is essential
    to utilize semantic information. To this end, we propose a semantically motivated
    indicator for classifying VN-MWE and define features that are related to various
    semantic spaces and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework.
    We empirically demonstrate that our semantic feature set yields better performance
    than the common linguistic and statistical feature sets and that combining semantic
    features contributes to the VN-MWEs identification task.

  abstract: 'Semantic relation classification remains a challenge in natural language
    processing. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical recurrent neural network
    that is capable of extracting information from raw sentences for relation classification.
    Our model has several distinctive features: (1) Each sentence is divided into
    three context subsequences according to two annotated nominals, which allows the
    model to encode each context subsequence independently so as to selectively focus
    as on the important context information; (2) The hierarchical model consists of
    two recurrent neural networks (RNNs): the first one learns context representations
    of the three context subsequences respectively, and the second one computes semantic
    composition of these three representations and produces a sentence representation
    for the relationship classification of the two nominals. (3) The attention mechanism
    is adopted in both RNNs to encourage the model to concentrate on the important
    information when learning the sentence representations. Experimental results on
    the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset demonstrate that our model is comparable to the
    state-of-the-art without using any hand-crafted features.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes a unified neural architecture for identifying and
    classifying multi-typed semantic relations between words in a sentence. We investigate
    two typical and well-studied tasks: semantic role labeling (SRL) which identifies
    the relations between predicates and arguments, and relation classification (RC)
    which focuses on the relation between two entities or nominals. While mostly studied
    separately in prior work, we show that the two tasks can be effectively connected
    and modeled using a general architecture. Experiments on CoNLL-2009 benchmark
    datasets show that our SRL models significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches.
    Our RC models also yield competitive performance with the best published records.
    Furthermore, we show that the two tasks can be trained jointly with multi-task
    learning, resulting in additive significant improvements for SRL.'

  abstract: 'We present a successful collaboration of word embeddings and co-training
    to tackle in the most difficult test case of semantic role labeling: predicting
    out-of-domain and unseen semantic frames. Despite the fact that co-training is
    a successful traditional semi-supervised method, its application in SRL is very
    limited especially when a huge amount of labeled data is available. In this work,
    co-training is used together with word embeddings to improve the performance of
    a system trained on a large training dataset. We also introduce a semantic role
    labeling system with a simple learning architecture and effective inference that
    is easily adaptable to semi-supervised settings with new training data and/or
    new features. On the out-of-domain testing set of the standard benchmark CoNLL
    2009 data our simple approach achieves high performance and improves state-of-the-art
    results.'

  abstract: Compositional distributional semantic models (CDSMs) have successfully
    been applied to the task of predicting the meaning of a range of linguistic constructions.
    Their performance on semi-compositional word formation process of (morphological)
    derivation, however, has been extremely variable, with no large-scale empirical
    investigation to date. This paper fills that gap, performing an analysis of CDSM
    predictions on a large dataset (over 30,000 German derivationally related word
    pairs). We use linear regression models to analyze CDSM performance and obtain
    insights into the linguistic factors that influence how predictable the distributional
    context of a derived word is going to be. We identify various such factors, notably
    part of speech, argument structure, and semantic regularity.

  abstract: 'We present a model of visually-grounded language learning based on stacked
    gated recurrent neural networks which learns to predict visual features given
    an image description in the form of a sequence of phonemes. The learning task
    resembles that faced by human language learners who need to discover both structure
    and meaning from noisy and ambiguous data across modalities. We show that our
    model indeed learns to predict features of the visual context given phonetically
    transcribed image descriptions, and show that it represents linguistic information
    in a hierarchy of levels: lower layers in the stack are comparatively more sensitive
    to form, whereas higher layers are more sensitive to meaning.'

  abstract: Several recent studies have shown that eye movements during reading provide
    information about grammatical and syntactic processing, which can assist the induction
    of NLP models. All these studies have been limited to English, however. This study
    shows that gaze and part of speech (PoS) correlations largely transfer across
    English and French. This means that we can replicate previous studies on gaze-based
    PoS tagging for French, but also that we can use English gaze data to assist the
    induction of French NLP models.

  abstract: Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts
    of two input sentences, and simply ignore the dissimilar parts, which usually
    give us some clues and semantic meanings about the sentences. In this work, we
    propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities
    by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model represents
    each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word
    based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed
    into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching
    vector. After this, a two-channel CNN model is employed to capture features by
    composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is
    estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our
    model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task,
    and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.

  abstract: "Determining the intended sense of words in text \u2013 word sense disambiguation\
    \ (WSD) \u2013 is a long-standing problem in natural language processing. Recently,\
    \ researchers have shown promising results using word vectors extracted from a\
    \ neural network language model as features in WSD algorithms. However, a simple\
    \ average or concatenation of word vectors for each word in a text loses the sequential\
    \ and syntactic information of the text. In this paper, we study WSD with a sequence\
    \ learning neural net, LSTM, to better capture the sequential and syntactic patterns\
    \ of the text. To alleviate the lack of training data in all-words WSD, we employ\
    \ the same LSTM in a semi-supervised label propagation classifier. We demonstrate\
    \ state-of-the-art results, especially on verbs."

  abstract: "Neural network training has been shown to be advantageous in many natural\
    \ language processing applications, such as language modelling or machine translation.\
    \ In this paper, we describe in detail a novel domain adaptation mechanism in\
    \ neural network training. Instead of learning and adapting the neural network\
    \ on millions of training sentences \u2013 which can be very time-consuming or\
    \ even infeasible in some cases \u2013 we design a domain adaptation gating mechanism\
    \ which can be used in recurrent neural networks and quickly learn the out-of-domain\
    \ knowledge directly from the word vector representations with little speed overhead.\
    \ In our experiments, we use the recurrent neural network language model (LM)\
    \ as a case study. We show that the neural LM perplexity can be reduced by 7.395\
    \ and 12.011 using the proposed domain adaptation mechanism on the Penn Treebank\
    \ and News data, respectively. Furthermore, we show that using the domain-adapted\
    \ neural LM to re-rank the statistical machine translation n-best list on the\
    \ French-to-English language pair can significantly improve translation quality."

  abstract: Evaluation of machine translation (MT) into morphologically rich languages
    (MRL) has not been well studied despite posing many challenges. In this paper,
    we explore the use of embeddings obtained from different levels of lexical and
    morpho-syntactic linguistic analysis and show that they improve MT evaluation
    into an MRL. Specifically we report on Arabic, a language with complex and rich
    morphology. Our results show that using a neural-network model with different
    input representations produces results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art
    for MT evaluation into Arabic, by almost over 75% increase in correlation with
    human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation quality task. More importantly, we demonstrate
    the usefulness of morpho-syntactic representations to model sentence similarity
    for MT evaluation and address complex linguistic phenomena of Arabic.

  abstract: "In this paper we describe and evaluate methods to perform ensemble prediction\
    \ in neural machine translation (NMT). We compare two methods of ensemble set\
    \ induction: sampling parameter initializations for an NMT system, which is a\
    \ relatively established method in NMT (Sutskever et al., 2014), and NMT systems\
    \ translating from different source languages into the same target language, i.e.,\
    \ multi-source ensembles, a method recently introduced by Firat et al. (2016).\
    \ We are motivated by the observation that for different language pairs systems\
    \ make different types of mistakes. We propose several methods with different\
    \ degrees of parameterization to combine individual predictions of NMT systems\
    \ so that they mutually compensate for each other\u2019s mistakes and improve\
    \ overall performance. We find that the biggest improvements can be obtained from\
    \ a context-dependent weighting scheme for multi-source ensembles. This result\
    \ offers stronger support for the linguistic motivation of using multi-source\
    \ ensembles than previous approaches. Evaluation is carried out for German and\
    \ French into English translation. The best multi-source ensemble method achieves\
    \ an improvement of up to 2.2 BLEU points over the strongest single-source ensemble\
    \ baseline, and a 2 BLEU improvement over a multi-source ensemble baseline."

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoding method for phrase-based statistical
    machine translation which directly uses multiple preordering candidates as a graph
    structure. Compared with previous phrase-based decoding methods, our method is
    based on a simple left-to-right dynamic programming in which no decoding-time
    reordering is performed. As a result, its runtime is very fast and implementing
    the algorithm becomes easy. Our system does not depend on specific preordering
    methods as long as they output multiple preordering candidates, and it is trivial
    to employ existing preordering methods into our system. In our experiments for
    translating diverse 11 languages into English, the proposed method outperforms
    conventional phrase-based decoder in terms of translation qualities under comparable
    or faster decoding time.

  abstract: "Community Question Answering (cQA) forums have become a popular medium\
    \ for soliciting direct answers to specific questions of users from experts or\
    \ other experienced users on a given topic. However, for a given question, users\
    \ sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers\
    \ to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To alleviate\
    \ this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict the quality\
    \ of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP systems either\
    \ learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or b) Deep Learning\
    \ (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required feature representations.\
    \ In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as - \u201CDeep Feature\
    \ Fusion Network (DFFN)\u201D which combines the advantages of both hand-crafted\
    \ features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along\
    \ with its metadata, the DFFN architecture independently - a) learns features\
    \ from the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and b) computes hand-crafted features using\
    \ various external resources and then combines them using a fully connected neural\
    \ network trained to predict the final answer quality. DFFN is end-end differentiable\
    \ and trained as a single system. We propose two different DFFN architectures\
    \ which vary mainly in the way they model the input question/answer pair - DFFN-CNN\
    \ uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and DFFN-BLNA uses a Bi-directional\
    \ LSTM with Neural Attention (BLNA). Both these proposed variants of DFFN (DFFN-CNN\
    \ and DFFN-BLNA) achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard SemEval-2015\
    \ and SemEval-2016 benchmark datasets and outperforms baseline approaches which\
    \ individually employ either HCF or DL based techniques alone."

  abstract: Identifying events of a specific type is a challenging task as events
    in texts are described in numerous and diverse ways. Aiming to resolve high complexities
    of event descriptions, previous work (Huang and Riloff, 2013) proposes multi-faceted
    event recognition and a bootstrapping method to automatically acquire both event
    facet phrases and event expressions from unannotated texts. However, to ensure
    high quality of learned phrases, this method is constrained to only learn phrases
    that match certain syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a bilingual
    structure projection algorithm that explores linguistic divergences between two
    languages (Chinese and English) and mines new phrases with new syntactic structures,
    which have been ignored in the previous work. Experiments show that our approach
    can successfully find novel event phrases and structures, e.g., phrases headed
    by nouns. Furthermore, the newly mined phrases are capable of recognizing additional
    event descriptions and increasing the recall of event recognition.

  abstract: Previous studies on temporal relation extraction focus on mining sentence-level
    information or enforcing coherence on different temporal relation types among
    various event mentions in the same sentence or neighboring sentences, largely
    ignoring those discourse-level temporal relations in nonadjacent sentences. In
    this paper, we propose a discourse-level global inference model to mine those
    temporal relations between event mentions in document-level, especially in nonadjacent
    sentences. Moreover, we provide various kinds of discourse-level constraints,
    which derived from event semantics, to further improve our global inference model.
    Evaluation on a Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our discourse-level
    global inference model over two strong baselines.

  abstract: Nowadays, neural networks play an important role in the task of relation
    classification. By designing different neural architectures, researchers have
    improved the performance to a large extent in comparison with traditional methods.
    However, existing neural networks for relation classification are usually of shallow
    architectures (e.g., one-layer convolutional neural networks or recurrent networks).
    They may fail to explore the potential representation space in different abstraction
    levels. In this paper, we propose deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for relation
    classification to tackle this challenge. Further, we propose a data augmentation
    method by leveraging the directionality of relations. We evaluated our DRNNs on
    the SemEval-2010 Task 8, and achieve an F1-score of 86.1%, outperforming previous
    state-of-the-art recorded results.

  abstract: Distant supervision is an efficient approach that automatically generates
    labeled data for relation extraction (RE). Traditional distantly supervised RE
    systems rely heavily on handcrafted features, and hence suffer from error propagation.
    Recently, a neural network architecture has been proposed to automatically extract
    features for relation classification. However, this approach follows the traditional
    expressed-at-least-once assumption, and fails to make full use of information
    across different sentences. Moreover, it ignores the fact that there can be multiple
    relations holding between the same entity pair. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance
    multi-label convolutional neural network for distantly supervised RE. It first
    relaxes the expressed-at-least-once assumption, and employs cross-sentence max-pooling
    so as to enable information sharing across different sentences. Then it handles
    overlapping relations by multi-label learning with a neural network classifier.
    Experimental results show that our approach performs significantly and consistently
    better than state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract: "We propose an approach to Named Entity Disambiguation that avoids a problem\
    \ of standard work on the task (likewise affecting fully supervised, weakly supervised,\
    \ or distantly supervised machine learning techniques): the treatment of name\
    \ mentions referring to people with no (or very little) coverage in the textual\
    \ training data is systematically incorrect. We propose to indirectly take into\
    \ account the property information for the \u201Cnon-prominent\u201D name bearers,\
    \ such as nationality and profession (e.g., for a Canadian law professor named\
    \ Michael Jackson, with no Wikipedia article, it is very hard to obtain reliable\
    \ textual training data). The target property information for the entities is\
    \ directly available from name authority files, or inferrable, e.g., from listings\
    \ of sportspeople etc. Our proposed approach employs topic modeling to exploit\
    \ textual training data based on entities sharing the relevant properties. In\
    \ experiments with a pilot implementation of the general approach, we show that\
    \ the approach does indeed work well for name/referent pairs with limited textual\
    \ coverage in the training data."

  abstract: In Natural Language Generation (NLG), one important limitation is the
    lack of common benchmarks on which to train, evaluate and compare data-to-text
    generators. In this paper, we make one step in that direction and introduce a
    method for automatically creating an arbitrary large repertoire of data units
    that could serve as input for generation. Using both automated metrics and a human
    evaluation, we show that the data units produced by our method are both diverse
    and coherent.

  abstract: Sentence compression is a way to perform text simplification and is usually
    handled in a monolingual setting. In this paper, we study ways to extend sentence
    compression in a bilingual context, where the goal is to obtain parallel compressions
    of parallel sentences. This can be beneficial for a series of multilingual natural
    language processing (NLP) tasks. We compare two ways to take bilingual information
    into account when compressing parallel sentences. Their efficiency is contrasted
    on a parallel corpus of News articles.

  abstract: In the age of information exploding, multi-document summarization is attracting
    particular attention for the ability to help people get the main ideas in a short
    time. Traditional extractive methods simply treat the document set as a group
    of sentences while ignoring the global semantics of the documents. Meanwhile,
    neural document model is effective on representing the semantic content of documents
    in low-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose a document-level reconstruction
    framework named DocRebuild, which reconstructs the documents with summary sentences
    through a neural document model and selects summary sentences to minimize the
    reconstruction error. We also apply two strategies, sentence filtering and beamsearch,
    to improve the performance of our method. Experimental results on the benchmark
    datasets DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 show that DocRebuild is effective and outperforms
    the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms.

  abstract: The search space in grammar-based natural language generation tasks can
    get very large, which is particularly problematic when generating long utterances
    or paragraphs. Using surface realization with OpenCCG as an example, we show that
    we can effectively detect partial solutions (edges) which cannot ultimately be
    part of a complete sentence because of their syntactic category. Formulating the
    completion of an edge into a sentence as finding a solution path in a large state-transition
    system, we demonstrate a connection to AI Planning which is concerned with this
    kind of problem. We design a compilation from OpenCCG into AI Planning allowing
    the detection of infeasible edges via AI Planning dead-end detection methods (proving
    the absence of a solution to the compilation). Our experiments show that this
    can filter out large fractions of infeasible edges in, and thus benefit the performance
    of, complex realization processes.

  abstract: 'Research in multi-document summarization has focused on newswire corpora
    since the early beginnings. However, the newswire genre provides genre-specific
    features such as sentence position which are easy to exploit in summarization
    systems. Such easy to exploit genre-specific features are available in other genres
    as well. We therefore present the new hMDS corpus for multi-document summarization,
    which contains heterogeneous source documents from multiple text genres, as well
    as summaries with different lengths. For the construction of the corpus, we developed
    a novel construction approach which is suited to build large and heterogeneous
    summarization corpora with little effort. The method reverses the usual process
    of writing summaries for given source documents: it combines already available
    summaries with appropriate source documents. In a detailed analysis, we show that
    our new corpus is significantly different from the homogeneous corpora commonly
    used, and that it is heterogeneous along several dimensions. Our experimental
    evaluation using well-known state-of-the-art summarization systems shows that
    our corpus poses new challenges in the field of multi-document summarization.
    Last but not least, we make our corpus publicly available to the research community
    at the corpus web page https://github.com/AIPHES/hMDS.'

  abstract: Sentiment polarity lexicons are key resources for sentiment analysis,
    and researchers have invested a lot of efforts in their manual creation. However,
    there has been a recent shift towards automatically extracted lexicons, which
    are orders of magnitude larger and perform much better. These lexicons are typically
    mined using bootstrapping, starting from very few seed words whose polarity is
    given, e.g., 50-60 words, and sometimes even just 5-6. Here we demonstrate that
    much higher-quality lexicons can be built by starting with hundreds of words and
    phrases as seeds, especially when they are in-domain. Thus, we combine (i) mid-sized
    high-quality manually crafted lexicons as seeds and (ii) bootstrapping, in order
    to build large-scale lexicons.

  abstract: Emotion classification from text typically requires some degree of word-emotion
    association, either gathered from pre-existing emotion lexicons or calculated
    using some measure of semantic relatedness. Most emotion lexicons contain a fixed
    number of emotion categories and provide a rather limited coverage. Current measures
    of computing semantic relatedness, on the other hand, do not adapt well to the
    specific task of word-emotion association and therefore, yield average results.
    In this work, we propose an unsupervised method of learning word-emotion association
    from large text corpora, called Selective Co-occurrences (SECO), by leveraging
    the property of mutual exclusivity generally exhibited by emotions. Extensive
    evaluation, using just one seed word per emotion category, indicates the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach over three emotion lexicons and two state-of-the-art
    models of word embeddings on three datasets from different domains.

  abstract: NBSVM is one of the most popular methods for text classification and has
    been widely used as baselines for various text representation approaches. It uses
    Naive Bayes (NB) feature to weight sparse bag-of-n-grams representation. N-gram
    captures word order in short context and NB feature assigns more weights to those
    important words. However, NBSVM suffers from sparsity problem and is reported
    to be exceeded by newly proposed distributed (dense) text representations learned
    by neural networks. In this paper, we transfer the n-grams and NB weighting to
    neural models. We train n-gram embeddings and use NB weighting to guide the neural
    models to focus on important words. In fact, our methods can be viewed as distributed
    (dense) counterparts of sparse bag-of-n-grams in NBSVM. We discover that n-grams
    and NB weighting are also effective in distributed representations. As a result,
    our models achieve new strong baselines on 9 text classification datasets, e.g.
    on IMDB dataset, we reach performance of 93.5% accuracy, which exceeds previous
    state-of-the-art results obtained by deep neural models. All source codes are

  abstract: "Sarcasm detection is a key task for many natural language processing\
    \ tasks. In sentiment analysis, for example, sarcasm can flip the polarity of\
    \ an \u201Capparently positive\u201D sentence and, hence, negatively affect polarity\
    \ detection performance. To date, most approaches to sarcasm detection have treated\
    \ the task primarily as a text categorization problem. Sarcasm, however, can be\
    \ expressed in very subtle ways and requires a deeper understanding of natural\
    \ language that standard text categorization techniques cannot grasp. In this\
    \ work, we develop models based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network\
    \ for extracting sentiment, emotion and personality features for sarcasm detection.\
    \ Such features, along with the network\u2019s baseline features, allow the proposed\
    \ models to outperform the state of the art on benchmark datasets. We also address\
    \ the often ignored generalizability issue of classifying data that have not been\
    \ seen by the models at learning phase."

  abstract: Cross-lingual sentiment classification (CLSC) seeks to use resources from
    a source language in order to detect sentiment and classify text in a target language.
    Almost all research into CLSC has been carried out at sentence and document level,
    although this level of granularity is often less useful. This paper explores methods
    for performing aspect-based cross-lingual sentiment classification (aspect-based
    CLSC) for under-resourced languages. Given the limited nature of parallel data
    for many languages, we would like to make the most of this resource for our task.
    We compare zero-shot learning, bilingual word embeddings, stacked denoising autoencoder
    representations and machine translation techniques for aspect-based CLSC. Each
    of these approaches requires differing amounts of parallel data. We show that
    models based on distributed semantics can achieve comparable results to machine
    translation on aspect-based CLSC and give an analysis of the errors found for
    each method.

  abstract: Emotions in code-switching text can be expressed in either monolingual
    or bilingual forms. However, relatively little research has emphasized on code-switching
    text. In this paper, we propose a Bilingual Attention Network (BAN) model to aggregate
    the monolingual and bilingual informative words to form vectors from the document
    representation, and integrate the attention vectors to predict the emotion. The
    experiments show that the effectiveness of the proposed model. Visualization of
    the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative
    words.

  abstract: Most neural network models for document classification on social media
    focus on text information to the neglect of other information on these platforms.
    In this paper, we classify post stance on social media channels and develop UTCNN,
    a neural network model that incorporates user tastes, topic tastes, and user comments
    on posts. UTCNN not only works on social media texts, but also analyzes texts
    in forums and message boards. Experiments performed on Chinese Facebook data and
    English online debate forum data show that UTCNN achieves a 0.755 macro average
    f-score for supportive, neutral, and unsupportive stance classes on Facebook data,
    which is significantly better than models in which either user, topic, or comment
    information is withheld. This model design greatly mitigates the lack of data
    for the minor class. In addition, UTCNN yields a 0.842 accuracy on English online
    debate forum data, which also significantly outperforms results from previous
    work, showing that UTCNN performs well regardless of language or platform.

  abstract: Human languages have multiple strategies that allow us to discriminate
    objects in a vast variety of contexts. Colours have been extensively studied from
    this point of view. In particular, previous research in artificial language evolution
    has shown how artificial languages may emerge based on specific strategies to
    distinguish colours. Still, it has not been shown how several strategies of diverse
    complexity can be autonomously managed by artificial agents . We propose an intrinsic
    motivation system that allows agents in a population to create a shared artificial
    language and progressively increase its expressive power. Our results show that
    with such a system agents successfully regulate their language development, which
    indicates a relation between population size and consistency in the emergent communicative
    systems.

  abstract: Evocation is a directed yet weighted semantic relationship between lexicalized
    concepts. Although evocation relations are considered potentially useful in several
    semantic NLP tasks, the prediction of the evocation relation between an arbitrary
    pair of concepts remains difficult, since evocation relationships cover a broader
    range of semantic relations rooted in human perception and experience. This paper
    presents a supervised learning approach to predict the strength (by regression)
    and to determine the directionality (by classification) of the evocation relation
    that might hold between a pair of lexicalized concepts. Empirical results that
    were obtained by investigating useful features are shown, indicating that a combination
    of the proposed features largely outperformed individual baselines, and also suggesting
    that semantic relational vectors computed from existing semantic vectors for lexicalized
    concepts were indeed effective for both the prediction of strength and the determination
    of directionality.

  abstract: 'Exploring language usage through frequency analysis in large corpora
    is a defining feature in most recent work in corpus and computational linguistics.
    From a psycholinguistic perspective, however, the corpora used in these contributions
    are often not representative of language usage: they are either domain-specific,
    limited in size, or extracted from unreliable sources. In an effort to address
    this limitation, we introduce SubIMDB, a corpus of everyday language spoken text
    we created which contains over 225 million words. The corpus was extracted from
    38,102 subtitles of family, comedy and children movies and series, and is the
    first sizeable structured corpus of subtitles made available. Our experiments
    show that word frequency norms extracted from this corpus are more effective than
    those from well-known norms such as Kucera-Francis, HAL and SUBTLEXus in predicting
    various psycholinguistic properties of words, such as lexical decision times,
    familiarity, age of acquisition and simplicity. We also provide evidence that
    contradict the long-standing assumption that the ideal size for a corpus can be
    determined solely based on how well its word frequencies correlate with lexical
    decision times.'

  abstract: Language students are most engaged while reading texts at an appropriate
    difficulty level. However, existing methods of evaluating text difficulty focus
    mainly on vocabulary and do not prioritize grammatical features, hence they do
    not work well for language learners with limited knowledge of grammar. In this
    paper, we introduce grammatical templates, the expert-identified units of grammar
    that students learn from class, as an important feature of text difficulty evaluation.
    Experimental classification results show that grammatical template features significantly
    improve text difficulty prediction accuracy over baseline readability features
    by 7.4%. Moreover,we build a simple and human-understandable text difficulty evaluation
    approach with 87.7% accuracy, using only 5 grammatical template features.

  abstract: We analyze the performance of encoder-decoder neural models and compare
    them with well-known established methods. The latter represent different classes
    of traditional approaches that are applied to the monotone sequence-to-sequence
    tasks OCR post-correction, spelling correction, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion,
    and lemmatization. Such tasks are of practical relevance for various higher-level
    research fields including digital humanities, automatic text correction, and speech
    recognition. We investigate how well generic deep-learning approaches adapt to
    these tasks, and how they perform in comparison with established and more specialized
    methods, including our own adaptation of pruned CRFs.

  abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) completion adds new facts to a KG by making inferences
    from existing facts. Most existing methods ignore the time information and only
    learn from time-unknown fact triples. In dynamic environments that evolve over
    time, it is important and challenging for knowledge graph completion models to
    take into account the temporal aspects of facts. In this paper, we present a novel
    time-aware knowledge graph completion model that is able to predict links in a
    KG using both the existing facts and the temporal information of the facts. To
    incorporate the happening time of facts, we propose a time-aware KG embedding
    model using temporal order information among facts. To incorporate the valid time
    of facts, we propose a joint time-aware inference model based on Integer Linear
    Programming (ILP) using temporal consistencyinformationasconstraints. Wefurtherintegratetwomodelstomakefulluseofglobal
    temporal information. We empirically evaluate our models on time-aware KG completion
    task. Experimental results show that our time-aware models achieve the state-of-the-art
    on temporal facts consistently.

  abstract: Ordinal regression which is known with learning to rank has long been
    used in information retrieval (IR). Learning to rank algorithms, have been tailored
    in document ranking, information filtering, and building large aligned corpora
    successfully. In this paper, we propose to use this algorithm for query modeling
    in cross-language environments. To this end, first we build a query-generated
    training data using pseudo-relevant documents to the query and all translation
    candidates. The pseudo-relevant documents are obtained by top-ranked documents
    in response to a translation of the original query. The class of each candidate
    in the training data is determined based on presence/absence of the candidate
    in the pseudo-relevant documents. We learn an ordinal regression model to score
    the candidates based on their relevance to the context of the query, and after
    that, we construct a query-dependent translation model using a softmax function.
    Finally, we re-weight the query based on the obtained model. Experimental results
    on French, German, Spanish, and Italian CLEF collections demonstrate that the
    proposed method achieves better results compared to state-of-the-art cross-language
    information retrieval methods, particularly in long queries with large training
    data.

  abstract: In real-world data, e.g., from Web forums, text is often contaminated
    with redundant or irrelevant content, which leads to introducing noise in machine
    learning algorithms. In this paper, we apply Long Short-Term Memory networks with
    an attention mechanism, which can select important parts of text for the task
    of similar question retrieval from community Question Answering (cQA) forums.
    In particular, we use the attention weights for both selecting entire sentences
    and their subparts, i.e., word/chunk, from shallow syntactic trees. More interestingly,
    we apply tree kernels to the filtered text representations, thus exploiting the
    implicit features of the subtree space for learning question reranking. Our results
    show that the attention-based pruning allows for achieving the top position in
    the cQA challenge of SemEval 2016, with a relatively large gap from the other
    participants while greatly decreasing running time.

  abstract: 'This work focuses on answering single-relation factoid questions over
    Freebase. Each question can acquire the answer from a single fact of form (subject,
    predicate, object) in Freebase. This task, simple question answering (SimpleQA),
    can be addressed via a two-step pipeline: entity linking and fact selection. In
    fact selection, we match the subject entity in a fact candidate with the entity
    mention in the question by a character-level convolutional neural network (char-CNN),
    and match the predicate in that fact with the question by a word-level CNN (word-CNN).
    This work makes two main contributions. (i) A simple and effective entity linker
    over Freebase is proposed. Our entity linker outperforms the state-of-the-art
    entity linker over SimpleQA task. (ii) A novel attentive maxpooling is stacked
    over word-CNN, so that the predicate representation can be matched with the predicate-focused
    question representation more effectively. Experiments show that our system sets
    new state-of-the-art in this task.'

  abstract: The exchangeability assumption in topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    (LDA) often results in inferring inconsistent topics for the words of text spans
    like noun-phrases, which are usually expected to be topically coherent. We propose
    copulaLDA, that extends LDA by integrating part of the text structure to the model
    and relaxes the conditional independence assumption between the word-specific
    latent topics given the per-document topic distributions. To this end, we assume
    that the words of text spans like noun-phrases are topically bound and we model
    this dependence with copulas. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of
    copulaLDA on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation tasks on several publicly
    available corpora.

  abstract: In modern text annotation projects, crowdsourced annotations are often
    aggregated using item response models or by majority vote. Recently, item response
    models enhanced with generative data models have been shown to yield substantial
    benefits over those with conditional or no data models. However, suitable generative
    data models do not exist for many tasks, such as semantic labeling tasks. When
    no generative data model exists, we demonstrate that similar benefits may be derived
    by conditionally modeling documents that have been previously embedded in a semantic
    space using recent work in vector space models. We use this approach to show state-of-the-art
    results on a variety of semantic annotation aggregation tasks.

  abstract: Interactive-predictive machine translation (IPMT) is a translation mode
    which combines machine translation technology and human behaviours. In the IPMT
    system, the utilization of the prefix greatly affects the interaction efficiency.
    However, state-of-the-art methods filter translation hypotheses mainly according
    to their matching results with the prefix on character level, and the advantage
    of the prefix is not fully developed. Focusing on this problem, this paper mines
    the deep constraints of prefix on syntactic level to improve the performance of
    IPMT systems. Two syntactic subtree matching rules based on phrase structure grammar
    are proposed to filter the translation hypotheses more strictly. Experimental
    results on LDC Chinese-English corpora show that the proposed method outperforms
    state-of-the-art phrase-based IPMT system while keeping comparable decoding speed.

  abstract: In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has demonstrated state-of-the-art
    machine translation (MT) performance. It is a new approach to MT, which tries
    to learn a set of parameters to maximize the conditional probability of target
    sentences given source sentences. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
    improve the translation performance in NMT by conveying topic knowledge during
    translation. The proposed topic-informed NMT can increase the likelihood of selecting
    words from the same topic and domain for translation. Experimentally, we demonstrate
    that topic-informed NMT can achieve a 1.15 (3.3% relative) and 1.67 (5.4% relative)
    absolute improvement in BLEU score on the Chinese-to-English language pair using
    NIST 2004 and 2005 test sets, respectively, compared to NMT without topic information.

  abstract: We introduce a distribution based model to learn bilingual word embeddings
    from monolingual data. It is simple, effective and does not require any parallel
    data or any seed lexicon. We take advantage of the fact that word embeddings are
    usually in form of dense real-valued low-dimensional vector and therefore the
    distribution of them can be accurately estimated. A novel cross-lingual learning
    objective is proposed which directly matches the distributions of word embeddings
    in one language with that in the other language. During the joint learning process,
    we dynamically estimate the distributions of word embeddings in two languages
    respectively and minimize the dissimilarity between them through standard back
    propagation algorithm. Our learned bilingual word embeddings allow to group each
    word and its translations together in the shared vector space. We demonstrate
    the utility of the learned embeddings on the task of finding word-to-word translations
    from monolingual corpora. Our model achieved encouraging performance on data in
    both related languages and substantially different languages.

  abstract: Recently, the development of neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly
    improved the translation quality of automatic machine translation. While most
    sentences are more accurate and fluent than translations by statistical machine
    translation (SMT)-based systems, in some cases, the NMT system produces translations
    that have a completely different meaning. This is especially the case when rare
    words occur. When using statistical machine translation, it has already been shown
    that significant gains can be achieved by simplifying the input in a preprocessing
    step. A commonly used example is the pre-reordering approach. In this work, we
    used phrase-based machine translation to pre-translate the input into the target
    language. Then a neural machine translation system generates the final hypothesis
    using the pre-translation. Thereby, we use either only the output of the phrase-based
    machine translation (PBMT) system or a combination of the PBMT output and the
    source sentence. We evaluate the technique on the English to German translation
    task. Using this approach we are able to outperform the PBMT system as well as
    the baseline neural MT system by up to 2 BLEU points. We analyzed the influence
    of the quality of the initial system on the final result.

  abstract: With the success of word embedding methods in various Natural Language
    Processing tasks, all the field of distributional semantics has experienced a
    renewed interest. Beside the famous word2vec, recent studies have presented efficient
    techniques to build distributional thesaurus; in particular, Claveau et al. (2014)
    have already shown that Information Retrieval (IR) tools and concepts can be successfully
    used to build a thesaurus. In this paper, we address the problem of the evaluation
    of such thesauri or embedding models and compare their results. Through several
    experiments and by evaluating directly the results with reference lexicons, we
    show that the recent IR-based distributional models outperform state-of-the-art
    systems such as word2vec. Following the work of Claveau and Kijak (2016), we use
    IR as an applicative framework to indirectly evaluate the generated thesaurus.
    Here again, this task-based evaluation validates the IR approach used to build
    the thesaurus. Moreover, it allows us to compare these results with those from
    the direct evaluation framework used in the literature. The observed differences
    bring these evaluation habits into question.

  abstract: We propose a new word embedding model, inspired by GloVe, which is formulated
    as a feasible least squares optimization problem. In contrast to existing models,
    we explicitly represent the uncertainty about the exact definition of each word
    vector. To this end, we estimate the error that results from using noisy co-occurrence
    counts in the formulation of the model, and we model the imprecision that results
    from including uninformative context words. Our experimental results demonstrate
    that this model compares favourably with existing word embedding models.

  abstract: Most distributional lexico-semantic models derive their representations
    based on external language resources such as text corpora. In this study, we propose
    that internal language models, that are more closely aligned to the mental representations
    of words could provide important insights into cognitive science, including linguistics.
    Doing so allows us to reflect upon theoretical questions regarding the structure
    of the mental lexicon, and also puts into perspective a number of assumptions
    underlying recently proposed distributional text-based models. In particular,
    we focus on word-embedding models which have been proposed to learn aspects of
    word meaning in a manner similar to humans. These are contrasted with internal
    language models derived from a new extensive data set of word associations. Using
    relatedness and similarity judgments we evaluate these models and find that the
    word-association-based internal language models consistently outperform current
    state-of-the art text-based external language models, often with a large margin.
    These results are not just a performance improvement; they also have implications
    for our understanding of how distributional knowledge is used by people.

  abstract: We propose a novel word embedding-based hypernym generation model that
    jointly learns clusters of hyponym-hypernym relations, i.e., hypernymy, and projections
    from hyponym to hypernym embeddings. Most of the recent hypernym detection models
    focus on a hypernymy classification problem that determines whether a pair of
    words is in hypernymy or not. These models do not directly deal with a hypernym
    generation problem in that a model generates hypernyms for a given word. Differently
    from previous studies, our model jointly learns the clusters and projections with
    adjusting the number of clusters so that the number of clusters can be determined
    depending on the learned projections and vice versa. Our model also boosts the
    performance by incorporating inner product-based similarity measures and negative
    examples, i.e., sampled non-hypernyms, into our objectives in learning. We evaluated
    our joint learning models on the task of Japanese and English hypernym generation
    and showed a significant improvement over an existing pipeline model. Our model
    also compared favorably to existing distributed hypernym detection models on the
    English hypernym classification task.

  abstract: "Information status plays an important role in discourse processing. According\
    \ to the hearer\u2019s common sense knowledge and his comprehension of the preceding\
    \ text, a discourse entity could be old, mediated or new. In this paper, we propose\
    \ an attention-based LSTM model to address the problem of fine-grained information\
    \ status classification in an incremental manner. Our approach resembles how human\
    \ beings process the task, i.e., decide the information status of the current\
    \ discourse entity based on its preceding context. Experimental results on the\
    \ ISNotes corpus (Markert et al., 2012) reveal that (1) despite its moderate result,\
    \ our model with only word embedding features captures the necessary semantic\
    \ knowledge needed for the task by a large extent; and (2) when incorporating\
    \ with additional several simple features, our model achieves the competitive\
    \ results compared to the state-of-the-art approach (Hou et al., 2013) which heavily\
    \ depends on lots of hand-crafted semantic features."

    potential connective candidates by string matching, eliminate non-discourse usages
    from them with a binary classifier, resolve linking ambiguities among connective
    components by ranking, disambiguate relation types by a multiway classifier, and
    determine the argument boundaries by conditional random fields. The experiments
    on Chinese Discourse Treebank show that the F1 scores of 0.7506, 0.7693, 0.7458,

  abstract: We experiment with different ways of training LSTM networks to predict
    RST discourse trees. The main challenge for RST discourse parsing is the limited
    amounts of training data. We combat this by regularizing our models using task
    supervision from related tasks as well as alternative views on discourse structures.
    We show that a simple LSTM sequential discourse parser takes advantage of this
    multi-view and multi-task framework with 12-15% error reductions over our baseline
    (depending on the metric) and results that rival more complex state-of-the-art
    parsers.

  abstract: For the task of implicit discourse relation recognition, traditional models
    utilizing manual features can suffer from data sparsity problem. Neural models
    provide a solution with distributed representations, which could encode the latent
    semantic information, and are suitable for recognizing semantic relations between
    argument pairs. However, conventional vector representations usually adopt embeddings
    at the word level and cannot well handle the rare word problem without carefully
    considering morphological information at character level. Moreover, embeddings
    are assigned to individual words independently, which lacks of the crucial contextual
    information. This paper proposes a neural model utilizing context-aware character-enhanced
    embeddings to alleviate the drawbacks of the current word level representation.
    Our experiments show that the enhanced embeddings work well and the proposed model
    obtains state-of-the-art results.

  abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for measuring non-cooperation in
    dialogue. The key idea is that linguistic non-cooperation can be measured in terms
    of the extent to which dialogue participants deviate from conventions regarding
    the proper introduction and discharging of conversational obligations (e.g., the
    obligation to respond to a question). Previous work on non cooperation has focused
    mainly on non-linguistic task-related non-cooperation or modelled non-cooperation
    in terms of special rules describing non-cooperative behaviours. In contrast,
    we start from rules for normal/correct dialogue behaviour - i.e., a dialogue game
    - which in principle can be derived from a corpus of cooperative dialogues, and
    provide a quantitative measure for the degree to which participants comply with
    these rules. We evaluated the model on a corpus of political interviews, with
    encouraging results. The model predicts accurately the degree of cooperation for
    one of the two dialogue game roles (interviewer) and also the relative cooperation
    for both roles (i.e., which interlocutor in the conversation was most cooperative).
    Being able to measure cooperation has applications in many areas from the analysis
    - manual, semi and fully automatic - of natural language interactions to human-like
    virtual personal assistants, tutoring agents, sophisticated dialogue systems,
    and role-playing virtual humans.

  abstract: Cross document event coreference (CDEC) is an important task that aims
    at aggregating event-related information across multiple documents. We revisit
    the evaluation for CDEC, and discover that past works have adopted different,
    often inconsistent, evaluation settings, which either overlook certain mistakes
    in coreference decisions, or make assumptions that simplify the coreference task
    considerably. We suggest a new evaluation methodology which overcomes these limitations,
    and allows for an accurate assessment of CDEC systems. Our new evaluation setting
    better reflects the corpus-wide information aggregation ability of CDEC systems
    by separating event-coreference decisions made across documents from those made
    within a document. In addition, we suggest a better baseline for the task and
    semi-automatically identify several inconsistent annotations in the evaluation
    dataset.

  abstract: This study proposes a computational model of the discourse segments in
    lyrics to understand and to model the structure of lyrics. To test our hypothesis
    that discourse segmentations in lyrics strongly correlate with repeated patterns,
    we conduct the first large-scale corpus study on discourse segments in lyrics.
    Next, we propose the task to automatically identify segment boundaries in lyrics
    and train a logistic regression model for the task with the repeated pattern and
    textual features. The results of our empirical experiments illustrate the significance
    of capturing repeated patterns in predicting the boundaries of discourse segments
    in lyrics.

  abstract: In this paper we focus on the problem of dialog act (DA) labelling. This
    problem has recently attracted a lot of attention as it is an important sub-part
    of an automatic question answering system, which is currently in great demand.
    Traditional methods tend to see this problem as a sequence labelling task and
    deals with it by applying classifiers with rich features. Most of the current
    neural network models still omit the sequential information in the conversation.
    Henceforth, we apply a novel multi-level gated recurrent neural network (GRNN)
    with non-textual information to predict the DA tag. Our model not only utilizes
    textual information, but also makes use of non-textual and contextual information.
    In comparison, our model has shown significant improvement over previous works
    on Switchboard Dialog Act (SWDA) task by over 6%.

  abstract: Music information retrieval has emerged as a mainstream research area
    in the past two decades. Experiments on music mood classification have been performed
    mainly on Western music based on audio, lyrics and a combination of both. Unfortunately,
    due to the scarcity of digitalized resources, Indian music fares poorly in music
    mood retrieval research. In this paper, we identified the mood taxonomy and prepared
    multimodal mood annotated datasets for Hindi and Western songs. We identified
    important audio and lyric features using correlation based feature selection technique.
    Finally, we developed mood classification systems using Support Vector Machines
    and Feed Forward Neural Networks based on the features collected from audio, lyrics,
    and a combination of both. The best performing multimodal systems achieved F-measures
    of 75.1 and 83.5 for classifying the moods of the Hindi and Western songs respectively
    using Feed Forward Neural Networks. A comparative analysis indicates that the
    selected features work well for mood classification of the Western songs and produces
    better results as compared to the mood classification systems for Hindi songs.

  abstract: While automatic response generation for building chatbot systems has drawn
    a lot of attention recently, there is limited understanding on when we need to
    consider the linguistic context of an input text in the generation process. The
    task is challenging, as messages in a conversational environment are short and
    informal, and evidence that can indicate a message is context dependent is scarce.
    After a study of social conversation data crawled from the web, we observed that
    some characteristics estimated from the responses of messages are discriminative
    for identifying context dependent messages. With the characteristics as weak supervision,
    we propose using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn a classifier.
    Our method carries out text representation and classifier learning in a unified
    framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly
    outperform baseline methods on accuracy of classification.

  abstract: Identifying dialogue acts and dialogue modes during tutorial interactions
    is an extremely crucial sub-step in understanding patterns of effective tutor-tutee
    interactions. In this work, we develop a novel joint inference method that labels
    each utterance in a tutoring dialogue session with a dialogue act and a specific
    mode from a set of pre-defined dialogue acts and modes, respectively. Specifically,
    we develop our joint model using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), a framework that
    combines first-order logic with probabilities, and is thus capable of representing
    complex, uncertain knowledge. We define first-order formulas in our MLN that encode
    the inter-dependencies between dialogue modes and more fine-grained dialogue actions.
    We then use a joint inference to jointly label the modes as well as the dialogue
    acts in an utterance. We compare our system against a pipeline system based on
    SVMs on a real-world dataset with tutoring sessions of over 500 students. Our
    results show that the joint inference system is far more effective than the pipeline
    system in mode detection, and improves over the performance of the pipeline system
    by about 6 points in F1 score. The joint inference system also performs much better
    than the pipeline system in the context of labeling modes that highlight important
    pedagogical steps in tutoring.

  abstract: In this study, we applied a deep LSTM structure to classify dialogue acts
    (DAs) in open-domain conversations. We found that the word embeddings parameters,
    dropout regularization, decay rate and number of layers are the parameters that
    have the largest effect on the final system accuracy. Using the findings of these
    experiments, we trained a deep LSTM network that outperforms the state-of-the-art
    on the Switchboard corpus by 3.11%, and MRDA by 2.2%.

  abstract: An interactive Question Answering (QA) system frequently encounters non-sentential
    (incomplete) questions. These non-sentential questions may not make sense to the
    system when a user asks them without the context of conversation. The system thus
    needs to take into account the conversation context to process the question. In
    this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder decoder network
    that can generate a complete (intended) question, given an incomplete question
    and conversation context. RNN encoder decoder networks have been show to work
    well when trained on a parallel corpus with millions of sentences, however it
    is extremely hard to obtain conversation data of this magnitude. We therefore
    propose to decompose the original problem into two separate simplified problems
    where each problem focuses on an abstraction. Specifically, we train a semantic
    sequence model to learn semantic patterns, and a syntactic sequence model to learn
    linguistic patterns. We further combine syntactic and semantic sequence models
    to generate an ensemble model. Our model achieves a BLEU score of 30.15 as compared
    to 18.54 using a standard RNN encoder decoder model.

  abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component of question
    answering(QA) systems which has a significant impact on system quality. Most tranditional
    QA systems based on templates or rules tend to generate rigid and stylised responses
    without the natural variation of human language. Furthermore, such methods need
    an amount of work to generate the templates or rules. To address this problem,
    we propose a Context-Aware LSTM model for NLG. The model is completely driven
    by data without manual designed templates or rules. In addition, the context information,
    including the question to be answered, semantic values to be addressed in the
    response, and the dialogue act type during interaction, are well approached in
    the neural network model, which enables the model to produce variant and informative
    responses. The quantitative evaluation and human evaluation show that CA-LSTM
    obtains state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract: This work proposes a new confidence measure for evaluating text-to-speech
    alignment systems outputs, which is a key component for many applications, such
    as semi-automatic corpus anonymization, lips syncing, film dubbing, corpus preparation
    for speech synthesis and speech recognition acoustic models training. This confidence
    measure exploits deep neural networks that are trained on large corpora without
    direct supervision. It is evaluated on an open-source spontaneous speech corpus
    and outperforms a confidence score derived from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech
    aligner. We further show that this confidence measure can be used to fine-tune
    the output of this aligner and improve the quality of the resulting alignment.

  abstract: "In many applications such as personal digital assistants, there is a\
    \ constant need for new domains to increase the system\u2019s coverage of user\
    \ queries. A conventional approach is to learn a separate model every time a new\
    \ domain is introduced. This approach is slow, inefficient, and a bottleneck for\
    \ scaling to a large number of domains. In this paper, we introduce a framework\
    \ that allows us to have a single model that can handle all domains: including\
    \ unknown domains that may be created in the future as long as they are covered\
    \ in the master schema. The key idea is to remove the need for distinguishing\
    \ domains by explicitly predicting the schema of queries. Given permitted schema\
    \ of a query, we perform constrained decoding on a lattice of slot sequences allowed\

  abstract: Training good word embeddings requires large amounts of data. Out-of-vocabulary
    words will still be encountered at test-time, leaving these words without embeddings.
    To overcome this lack of embeddings for rare words, existing methods leverage
    morphological features to generate embeddings. While the existing methods use
    computationally-intensive rule-based (Soricut and Och, 2015) or tool-based (Botha
    and Blunsom, 2014) morphological analysis to generate embeddings, our system applies
    a computationally-simpler sub-word search on words that have existing embeddings.
    Embeddings of the sub-word search results are then combined using string similarity
    functions to generate rare word embeddings. We augmented pre-trained word embeddings
    with these novel embeddings and evaluated on a rare word similarity task, obtaining
    up to 3 times improvement in correlation over the original set of embeddings.
    Applying our technique to embeddings trained on larger datasets led to on-par
    performance with the existing state-of-the-art for this task. Additionally, while
    analysing augmented embeddings in a log-bilinear language model, we observed up
    to 50% reduction in rare word perplexity in comparison to other more complex language
    models.

  abstract: We introduce the task of detecting cross-lingual marketing blunders, which
    occur if a trade name resembles an inappropriate or negatively connotated word
    in a target language. To this end, we suggest a formal task definition and a semi-automatic
    method based the propagation of pragmatic labels from Wiktionary across sense-disambiguated
    translations. Our final tool assists users by providing clues for problematic
    names in any language, which we simulate in two experiments on detecting previously
    occurred marketing blunders and identifying relevant clues for established international
    brands. We conclude the paper with a suggested research roadmap for this new task.
    To initiate further research, we publish our online demo along with the source
    code and data at http://uby.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/blunder/.

  abstract: We present Ambient Search, an open source system for displaying and retrieving
    relevant documents in real time for speech input. The system works ambiently,
    that is, it unobstructively listens to speech streams in the background, identifies
    keywords and keyphrases for query construction and continuously serves relevant
    documents from its index. Query terms are ranked with Word2Vec and TF-IDF and
    are continuously updated to allow for ongoing querying of a document collection.
    The retrieved documents, in our case Wikipedia articles, are visualized in real
    time in a browser interface. Our evaluation shows that Ambient Search compares
    favorably to another implicit information retrieval system on speech streams.
    Furthermore, we extrinsically evaluate multiword keyphrase generation, showing
    positive impact for manual transcriptions.

  abstract: "The lack of a sufficient amount of data tailored for a task is a well-recognized\
    \ problem for many statistical NLP methods. In this paper, we explore whether\
    \ data sparsity can be successfully tackled when classifying language proficiency\
    \ levels in the domain of learner-written output texts. We aim at overcoming data\
    \ sparsity by incorporating knowledge in the trained model from another domain\
    \ consisting of input texts written by teaching professionals for learners. We\
    \ compare different domain adaptation techniques and find that a weighted combination\
    \ of the two types of data performs best, which can even rival systems based on\
    \ considerably larger amounts of in-domain data. Moreover, we show that normalizing\
    \ errors in learners\u2019 texts can substantially improve classification when\
    \ level-annotated in-domain data is not available."

  abstract: Textual information is of critical importance for automatic user classification
    in social media. However, most previous studies model textual features in a single
    perspective while the text in a user homepage typically possesses different styles
    of text, such as original message and comment from others. In this paper, we propose
    a novel approach, namely ensemble LSTM, to user classification by incorporating
    multiple textual perspectives. Specifically, our approach first learns a LSTM
    representation with a LSTM recurrent neural network and then presents a joint
    learning method to integrating all naturally-divided textual perspectives. Empirical
    studies on two basic user classification tasks, i.e., gender classification and
    age classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to
    user classification with multiple textual perspectives.

  abstract: "We extend classic review mining work by building a binary classifier\
    \ that predicts whether a review of a documentary film was written by an expert\
    \ or a layman with 90.70% accuracy (F1 score), and compare the characteristics\
    \ of the predicted classes. A variety of standard lexical and syntactic features\
    \ was used for this supervised learning task. Our results suggest that experts\
    \ write comparatively lengthier and more detailed reviews that feature more complex\
    \ grammar and a higher diversity in their vocabulary. Layman reviews are more\
    \ subjective and contextualized in peoples\u2019 everyday lives. Our error analysis\
    \ shows that laymen are about twice as likely to be mistaken as experts than vice\
    \ versa. We argue that the type of author might be a useful new feature for improving\
    \ the accuracy of predicting the rating, helpfulness and authenticity of reviews.\
    \ Finally, the outcomes of this work might help researchers and practitioners\

  abstract: Representing structured events as vectors in continuous space offers a
    new way for defining dense features for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
    Prior work has proposed effective methods to learn event representations that
    can capture syntactic and semantic information over text corpus, demonstrating
    their effectiveness for downstream tasks such as event-driven stock prediction.
    On the other hand, events extracted from raw texts do not contain background knowledge
    on entities and relations that they are mentioned. To address this issue, this
    paper proposes to leverage extra information from knowledge graph, which provides
    ground truth such as attributes and properties of entities and encodes valuable
    relations between entities. Specifically, we propose a joint model to combine
    knowledge graph information into the objective function of an event embedding
    learning model. Experiments on event similarity and stock market prediction show
    that our model is more capable of obtaining better event embeddings and making
    more accurate prediction on stock market volatilities.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to learn distributed representations
    of users and items from text comments for recommendation systems. Traditional
    recommendation algorithms, e.g. collaborative filtering and matrix completion,
    are not designed to exploit the key information hidden in the text comments, while
    existing opinion mining methods do not provide direct support to recommendation
    systems with useful features on users and items. Our approach attempts to construct
    vectors to represent profiles of users and items under a unified framework to
    maximize word appearance likelihood. Then, the vector representations are used
    for a recommendation task in which we predict scores on unobserved user-item pairs
    without given texts. The recommendation-aware distributed representation approach
    is fully supported by effective and efficient learning algorithms over massive
    text archive. Our empirical evaluations on real datasets show that our system
    outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline systems.

  abstract: Long-distance semantic dependencies are crucial for lexical choice in
    statistical machine translation. In this paper, we study semantic dependencies
    between verbs and their arguments by modeling selectional preferences in the context
    of machine translation. We incorporate preferences that verbs impose on subjects
    and objects into translation. In addition, bilingual selectional preferences between
    source-side verbs and target-side arguments are also investigated. Our experiments
    on Chinese-to-English translation tasks with large-scale training data demonstrate
    that statistical machine translation using verbal selectional preferences can
    achieve statistically significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline.

  abstract: Existing approaches for evaluating word order in machine translation work
    with metrics computed directly over a permutation of word positions in system
    output relative to a reference translation. However, every permutation factorizes
    into a permutation tree (PET) built of primal permutations, i.e., atomic units
    that do not factorize any further. In this paper we explore the idea that permutations
    factorizing into (on average) shorter primal permutations should represent simpler
    ordering as well. Consequently, we contribute Permutation Complexity, a class
    of metrics over PETs and their extension to forests, and define tight metrics,
    a sub-class of metrics implementing this idea. Subsequently we define example
    tight metrics and empirically test them in word order evaluation. Experiments
    on the WMT13 data sets for ten language pairs show that a tight metric is more
    often than not better than the baselines.

  abstract: Conventional attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) conducts
    dynamic alignment in generating the target sentence. By repeatedly reading the
    representation of source sentence, which keeps fixed after generated by the encoder
    (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the attention mechanism has greatly enhanced state-of-the-art
    NMT. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, called INTERACTIVE ATTENTION,
    which models the interaction between the decoder and the representation of source
    sentence during translation by both reading and writing operations. INTERACTIVE
    ATTENTION can keep track of the interaction history and therefore improve the
    translation performance. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation task
    show that INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can achieve significant improvements over both
    the previous attention-based NMT baseline and some state-of-the-art variants of
    attention-based NMT (i.e., coverage models (Tu et al., 2016)). And neural machine
    translator with our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can outperform the open source attention-based
    NMT system Groundhog by 4.22 BLEU points and the open source phrase-based system
    Moses by 3.94 BLEU points averagely on multiple test sets.

  abstract: Automated short-answer grading is key to help close the automation loop
    for large-scale, computerised testing in education. A wide range of features on
    different levels of linguistic processing has been proposed so far. We investigate
    the relative importance of the different types of features across a range of standard
    corpora (both from a language skill and content assessment context, in English
    and in German). We find that features on the lexical, text similarity and dependency
    level often suffice to approximate full-model performance. Features derived from
    semantic processing particularly benefit the linguistically more varied answers
    in content assessment corpora.

  abstract: Violence is a serious problems for cities like Chicago and has been exacerbated
    by the use of social media by gang-involved youths for taunting rival gangs. We
    present a corpus of tweets from a young and powerful female gang member and her
    communicators, which we have annotated with discourse intention, using a deep
    read to understand how and what triggered conversations to escalate into aggression.
    We use this corpus to develop a part-of-speech tagger and phrase table for the
    variant of English that is used and a classifier for identifying tweets that express
    grieving and aggression.

  abstract: "Nowadays, social media has become a popular platform for companies to\
    \ understand their customers. It provides valuable opportunities to gain new insights\
    \ into how a person\u2019s opinion about a product is influenced by his friends.\
    \ Though various approaches have been proposed to study the opinion formation\
    \ problem, they all formulate opinions as the derived sentiment values either\
    \ discrete or continuous without considering the semantic information. In this\
    \ paper, we propose a Content-based Social Influence Model to study the implicit\
    \ mechanism underlying the change of opinions. We then apply the learned model\
    \ to predict users\u2019 future opinions. The advantages of the proposed model\
    \ is the ability to handle the semantic information and to learn two influence\
    \ components including the opinion influence of the content information and the\
    \ social relation factors. In the experiments conducted on Twitter datasets, our\
    \ model significantly outperforms other popular opinion formation models."

  abstract: We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for learning and weighting
    symbolically-defined constraints to populate a log-linear model. The model jointly
    infers a vector of binary constraint values for each candidate output and likely
    definitions for these constraints, combining observations of the output classes
    with a (potentially infinite) grammar over potential constraint definitions. We
    present results on a small morphophonological system, English regular plurals,
    as a test case. The inferred constraints, based on a grammar of articulatory features,
    perform as well as theoretically-defined constraints on both observed and novel
    forms of English regular plurals. The learned constraint values and definitions
    also closely resemble standard constraints defined within phonological theory.

  abstract: This paper explores the role of tense information in Chinese causal analysis.
    Both tasks of causal type classification and causal directionality identification
    are experimented to show the significant improvement gained from tense features.
    To automatically extract the tense features, a Chinese tense predictor is proposed.
    Based on large amount of parallel data, our semi-supervised approach improves
    the dependency-based convolutional neural network (DCNN) models for Chinese tense
    labelling and thus the causal analysis.

  abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variants have been widely used
    to discover latent topics in textual documents. However, some of topics generated
    by LDA may be noisy with irrelevant words scattering across these topics. We name
    this kind of words as topic-indiscriminate words, which tend to make topics more
    ambiguous and less interpretable by humans. In our work, we propose a new topic
    model named TWLDA, which assigns low weights to words with low topic discriminating
    power (ability). Our experimental results show that the proposed approach, which
    effectively reduces the number of topic-indiscriminate words in discovered topics,
    improves the effectiveness of LDA.

  abstract: "Deep learning techniques are increasingly popular in the textual entailment\
    \ task, overcoming the fragility of traditional discrete models with hard alignments\
    \ and logics. In particular, the recently proposed attention models (Rockt\xE4\
    schel et al., 2015; Wang and Jiang, 2015) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by\
    \ computing soft word alignments between the premise and hypothesis sentences.\
    \ However, there remains a major limitation: this line of work completely ignores\
    \ syntax and recursion, which is helpful in many traditional efforts. We show\
    \ that it is beneficial to extend the attention model to tree nodes between premise\
    \ and hypothesis. More importantly, this subtree-level attention reveals information\
    \ about entailment relation. We study the recursive composition of this subtree-level\
    \ entailment relation, which can be viewed as a soft version of the Natural Logic\
    \ framework (MacCartney and Manning, 2009). Experiments show that our structured\
    \ attention and entailment composition model can correctly identify and infer\
    \ entailment relations from the bottom up, and bring significant improvements\
    \ in accuracy."

  abstract: Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are crucial lexico-semantic units in any
    language. However, most work on MWEs has been focused on standard monolingual
    corpora. In this work, we examine MWE usage on Twitter - an inherently multilingual
    medium with an extremely short average text length that is often replete with
    grammatical errors. In this work we present a new graph based, language agnostic
    method for automatically extracting MWEs from tweets. We show how our method outperforms
    standard Association Measures. We also present a novel unsupervised evaluation
    technique to ascertain the accuracy of MWE extraction.

  abstract: Event extraction is a difficult information extraction task. Li et al.
    (2014) explore the benefits of modeling event extraction and two related tasks,
    entity mention and relation extraction, jointly. This joint system achieves state-of-the-art
    performance in all tasks. However, as a system operating only at the sentence
    level, it misses valuable information from other parts of the document. In this
    paper, we present an incremental easy-first approach to make the global context
    of the entire document available to the intra-sentential, state-of-the-art event
    extractor. We show that our method robustly increases performance on two datasets,
    namely ACE 2005 and TAC 2015.

  abstract: Recently, end-to-end memory networks have shown promising results on Question
    Answering task, which encode the past facts into an explicit memory and perform
    reasoning ability by making multiple computational steps on the memory. However,
    memory networks conduct the reasoning on sentence-level memory to output coarse
    semantic vectors and do not further take any attention mechanism to focus on words,
    which may lead to the model lose some detail information, especially when the
    answers are rare or unknown words. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical
    Memory Networks, dubbed HMN. First, we encode the past facts into sentence-level
    memory and word-level memory respectively. Then, k-max pooling is exploited following
    reasoning module on the sentence-level memory to sample the -max pooling is exploited
    following reasoning module on the sentence-level memory to sample the k most relevant
    sentences to a question and feed these sentences into attention mechanism on the
    word-level memory to focus the words in the selected sentences. Finally, the prediction
    is jointly learned over the outputs of the sentence-level reasoning module and
    the word-level attention mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that
    our approach successfully conducts answer selection on unknown words and achieves
    a better performance than memory networks. most relevant sentences to a question
    and feed these sentences into attention mechanism on the word-level memory to
    focus the words in the selected sentences. Finally, the prediction is jointly
    learned over the outputs of the sentence-level reasoning module and the word-level
    attention mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully
    conducts answer selection on unknown words and achieves a better performance than
    memory networks.

  abstract: Previous studies have highlighted the necessity for entity linking systems
    to capture the local entity-mention similarities and the global topical coherence.
    We introduce a novel framework based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent
    neural networks to simultaneously model the local and global features for entity
    linking. The proposed model benefits from the capacity of convolutional neural
    networks to induce the underlying representations for local contexts and the advantage
    of recurrent neural networks to adaptively compress variable length sequences
    of predictions for global constraints. Our evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates
    the effectiveness of the model and yields the state-of-the-art performance on
    such datasets. In addition, we examine the entity linking systems on the domain
    adaptation setting that further demonstrates the cross-domain robustness of the
    proposed model.

  abstract: Aspect extraction identifies relevant features from a textual description
    of an entity, e.g., a phone, and is typically targeted to product descriptions,
    reviews, and other short texts as an enabling task for, e.g., opinion mining and
    information retrieval. Current aspect extraction methods mostly focus on aspect
    terms and often neglect interesting modifiers of the term or embed them in the
    aspect term without proper distinction. Moreover, flat syntactic structures are
    often assumed, resulting in inaccurate extractions of complex aspects. This paper
    studies the problem of structured aspect extraction, a variant of traditional
    aspect extraction aiming at a fine-grained extraction of complex (i.e., hierarchical)
    aspects. We propose an unsupervised and scalable method for structured aspect
    extraction consisting of statistical noun phrase clustering, cPMI-based noun phrase
    segmentation, and hierarchical pattern induction. Our evaluation shows a substantial
    improvement over existing methods in terms of both quality and computational efficiency.

  abstract: The conventional solution for handling sparsely labelled data is extensive
    feature engineering. This is time consuming and task and domain specific. We present
    a novel approach for learning embedded features that aims to alleviate this problem.
    Our approach jointly learns embeddings at different levels of granularity (word,
    sentence and document) along with the class labels. The intuition is that topic
    semantics represented by embeddings at multiple levels results in better classification.
    We evaluate this approach in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings on two
    sparsely labelled classification tasks, outperforming the handcrafted models and
    several embedding baselines.

  abstract: We present an approach to mathematical information retrieval (MIR) that
    exploits a special kind of technical terminology, referred to as a mathematical
    type. In this paper, we present and evaluate a type detection mechanism and show
    its positive effect on the retrieval of research-level mathematics. Our best model,
    which performs query expansion with a type-aware embedding space, strongly outperforms
    standard IR models with state-of-the-art query expansion (vector space-based and
    language modelling-based), on a relatively new corpus of research-level queries.

  abstract: Term co-occurrence in a sentence or paragraph is a powerful and often
    overlooked feature for text matching in document retrieval. In our experiments
    with matching email-style query messages to webpages, such term co-occurrence
    helped greatly to filter and rank documents, compared to matching document-size
    bags-of-words. The paper presents the results of the experiments as well as a
    text-matching model where the query shapes the vector space, a document is modelled
    by two or three vectors in this vector space, and the query-document similarity
    score depends on the length of the vectors and the relationships between them.

  abstract: Relation classification is the task of classifying the semantic relations
    between entity pairs in text. Observing that existing work has not fully explored
    using different representations for relation instances, especially in order to
    better handle the asymmetry of relation types, in this paper, we propose a neural
    network based method for relation classification that combines the raw sequence
    and the shortest dependency path representations of relation instances and uses
    mirror instances to perform pairwise relation classification. We evaluate our
    proposed models on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset. The empirical results show
    that with two additional features, our model achieves the state-of-the-art result
    of F1 score of 85.7.

  abstract: Answer selection is a core component in any question-answering systems.
    It aims to select correct answer sentences for a given question from a pool of
    candidate sentences. In recent years, many deep learning methods have been proposed
    and shown excellent results for this task. However, these methods typically require
    extensive parameter (and hyper-parameter) tuning, which give rise to efficiency
    issues for large-scale datasets, and potentially make them less portable across
    new datasets and domains (as re-tuning is usually required). In this paper, we
    propose an extremely efficient hybrid model (FastHybrid) that tackles the problem
    from both an accuracy and scalability point of view. FastHybrid is a light-weight
    model that requires little tuning and adaptation across different domains. It
    combines a fast deep model (which will be introduced in the method section) with
    an initial information retrieval model to effectively and efficiently handle answer
    selection. We introduce a new efficient attention mechanism in the hybrid model
    and demonstrate its effectiveness on several QA datasets. Experimental results
    show that although the hybrid uses no training data, its accuracy is often on-par
    with supervised deep learning techniques, while significantly reducing training
    and tuning costs across different domains.

  abstract: A spatial information extraction system retrieves spatial entities and
    their relationships for geological searches and reasoning. Spatial information
    systems have been developed mainly for English text, e.g., through the SpaceEval
    competition. Some of the techniques are useful but not directly applicable to
    Korean text, because of linguistic differences and the lack of language resources.
    In this paper, we propose a Korean spatial entity extraction model and a spatial
    relation extraction model; the spatial entity extraction model uses word vectors
    to alleviate the over generation and the spatial relation extraction mod-el uses
    dependency parse labels to find the proper arguments in relations. Experiments
    with Korean text show that the two models are effective for spatial information
    extraction.

  abstract: Recent trend in question answering (QA) systems focuses on using structured
    knowledge bases (KBs) to find answers. While these systems are able to provide
    more precise answers than information retrieval (IR) based QA systems, the natural
    incompleteness of KB inevitably limits the question scope that the system can
    answer. In this paper, we present a hybrid question answering (hybrid-QA) system
    which exploits both structured knowledge base and free text to answer a question.
    The main challenge is to recognize the meaning of a question using these two resources,
    i.e., structured KB and free text. To address this, we map relational phrases
    to KB predicates and textual relations simultaneously, and further develop an
    integer linear program (ILP) model to infer on these candidates and provide a
    globally optimal solution. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our system
    can benefit from both structured KB and free text, outperforming the state-of-the-art
    systems.

  abstract: "Distributed word representation is an efficient method for capturing\
    \ semantic and syntactic word relations. In this work, we introduce an extension\
    \ to the continuous bag-of-words model for learning word representations efficiently\
    \ by using implicit structure information. Instead of relying on a syntactic parser\
    \ which might be noisy and slow to build, we compute weights representing probabilities\
    \ of syntactic relations based on the Huffman softmax tree in an efficient heuristic.\
    \ The constructed \u201Cimplicit graphs\u201D from these weights show that these\
    \ weights contain useful implicit structure information. Extensive experiments\
    \ performed on several word similarity and word analogy tasks show gains compared\
    \ to the basic continuous bag-of-words model."

  abstract: With the development and the advancement of social networks, forums, blogs
    and online sales, a growing number of Arabs are expressing their opinions on the
    web. In this paper, a scheme of Arabic sentiment classification, which evaluates
    and detects the sentiment polarity from Arabic reviews and Arabic social media,
    is studied. We investigated in several architectures to build a quality neural
    word embeddings using a 3.4 billion words corpus from a collected 10 billion words
    web-crawled corpus. Moreover, a convolutional neural network trained on top of
    pre-trained Arabic word embeddings is used for sentiment classification to evaluate
    the quality of these word embeddings. The simulation results show that the proposed
    scheme outperforms the existed methods on 4 out of 5 balanced and unbalanced datasets.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis of short texts is challenging because of the limited
    contextual information they usually contain. In recent years, deep learning models
    such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
    have been applied to text sentiment analysis with comparatively remarkable results.
    In this paper, we describe a jointed CNN and RNN architecture, taking advantage
    of the coarse-grained local features generated by CNN and long-distance dependencies
    learned via RNN for sentiment analysis of short texts. Experimental results show
    an obvious improvement upon the state-of-the-art on three benchmark corpora, MR,
    SST1 and SST2, with 82.28%, 51.50% and 89.95% accuracy, respectively.

  abstract: "Rumour stance classification, the task that determines if each tweet\
    \ in a collection discussing a rumour is supporting, denying, questioning or simply\
    \ commenting on the rumour, has been attracting substantial interest. Here we\
    \ introduce a novel approach that makes use of the sequence of transitions observed\
    \ in tree-structured conversation threads in Twitter. The conversation threads\
    \ are formed by harvesting users\u2019 replies to one another, which results in\
    \ a nested tree-like structure. Previous work addressing the stance classification\
    \ task has treated each tweet as a separate unit. Here we analyse tweets by virtue\
    \ of their position in a sequence and test two sequential classifiers, Linear-Chain\
    \ CRF and Tree CRF, each of which makes different assumptions about the conversational\
    \ structure. We experiment with eight Twitter datasets, collected during breaking\
    \ news, and show that exploiting the sequential structure of Twitter conversations\
    \ achieves significant improvements over the non-sequential methods. Our work\
    \ is the first to model Twitter conversations as a tree structure in this manner,\

  abstract: Sarcasm detection has been modeled as a binary document classification
    task, with rich features being defined manually over input documents. Traditional
    models employ discrete manual features to address the task, with much research
    effect being devoted to the design of effective feature templates. We investigate
    the use of neural network for tweet sarcasm detection, and compare the effects
    of the continuous automatic features with discrete manual features. In particular,
    we use a bi-directional gated recurrent neural network to capture syntactic and
    semantic information over tweets locally, and a pooling neural network to extract
    contextual features automatically from history tweets. Results show that neural
    features give improved accuracies for sarcasm detection, with different error
    distributions compared with discrete manual features.

  abstract: The automated comparison of points of view between two politicians is
    a very challenging task, due not only to the lack of annotated resources, but
    also to the different dimensions participating to the definition of agreement
    and disagreement. In order to shed light on this complex task, we first carry
    out a pilot study to manually annotate the components involved in detecting agreement
    and disagreement. Then, based on these findings, we implement different features
    to capture them automatically via supervised classification. We do not focus on
    debates in dialogical form, but we rather consider sets of documents, in which
    politicians may express their position with respect to different topics in an
    implicit or explicit way, like during an electoral campaign. We create and make
    available three different datasets.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis (SA) using code-mixed data from social media has several
    applications in opinion mining ranging from customer satisfaction to social campaign
    analysis in multilingual societies. Advances in this area are impeded by the lack
    of a suitable annotated dataset. We introduce a Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed
    dataset for sentiment analysis and perform empirical analysis comparing the suitability
    and performance of various state-of-the-art SA methods in social media. In this
    paper, we introduce learning sub-word level representations in our LSTM (Subword-LSTM)
    architecture instead of character-level or word-level representations. This linguistic
    prior in our architecture enables us to learn the information about sentiment
    value of important morphemes. This also seems to work well in highly noisy text
    containing misspellings as shown in our experiments which is demonstrated in morpheme-level
    feature maps learned by our model. Also, we hypothesize that encoding this linguistic
    prior in the Subword-LSTM architecture leads to the superior performance. Our
    system attains accuracy 4-5% greater than traditional approaches on our dataset,
    and also outperforms the available system for sentiment analysis in Hi-En code-mixed
    text by 18%.

  abstract: Aspect phrase grouping is an important task in aspect-level sentiment
    analysis. It is a challenging problem due to polysemy and context dependency.
    We propose an Attention-based Deep Distance Metric Learning (ADDML) method, by
    considering aspect phrase representation as well as context representation. First,
    leveraging the characteristics of the review text, we automatically generate aspect
    phrase sample pairs for distant supervision. Second, we feed word embeddings of
    aspect phrases and their contexts into an attention-based neural network to learn
    feature representation of contexts. Both aspect phrase embedding and context embedding
    are used to learn a deep feature subspace for measure the distances between aspect
    phrases for K-means clustering. Experiments on four review datasets show that
    the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art strong baseline methods.

  abstract: Nowadays, neural networks play an important role in the task of relation
    classification. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional
    neural network architecture for this task. Our model makes full use of word embedding,
    part-of-speech tag embedding and position embedding information. Word level attention
    mechanism is able to better determine which parts of the sentence are most influential
    with respect to the two entities of interest. This architecture enables learning
    some important features from task-specific labeled data, forgoing the need for
    external knowledge such as explicit dependency structures. Experiments on the
    SemEval-2010 Task 8 benchmark dataset show that our model achieves better performances
    than several state-of-the-art neural network models and can achieve a competitive
    performance just with minimal feature engineering.

  abstract: This paper proposes a novel context-aware joint entity and word-level
    relation extraction approach through semantic composition of words, introducing
    a Table Filling Multi-Task Recurrent Neural Network (TF-MTRNN) model that reduces
    the entity recognition and relation classification tasks to a table-filling problem
    and models their interdependencies. The proposed neural network architecture is
    capable of modeling multiple relation instances without knowing the corresponding
    relation arguments in a sentence. The experimental results show that a simple
    approach of piggybacking candidate entities to model the label dependencies from
    relations to entities improves performance. We present state-of-the-art results
    with improvements of 2.0% and 2.7% for entity recognition and relation classification,
    respectively on CoNLL04 dataset.

  abstract: Parallel sentence representations are important for bilingual and cross-lingual
    tasks in natural language processing. In this paper, we explore a bilingual autoencoder
    approach to model parallel sentences. We extract sentence-level global descriptors
    (e.g. min, max) from word embeddings, and construct two monolingual autoencoders
    over these descriptors on the source and target language. In order to tightly
    connect the two autoencoders with bilingual correspondences, we force them to
    share the same decoding parameters and minimize a corpus-level semantic distance
    between the two languages. Being optimized towards a joint objective function
    of reconstruction and semantic errors, our bilingual antoencoder is able to learn
    continuous-valued latent representations for parallel sentences. Experiments on
    both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations on statistical machine translation tasks
    show that our autoencoder achieves substantial improvements over the baselines.

  abstract: "In this paper we combine two strands of machine translation (MT) research:\
    \ automatic post-editing (APE) and multi-engine (system combination) MT. APE systems\
    \ learn a target-language-side second stage MT system from the data produced by\
    \ human corrected output of a first stage MT system, to improve the output of\
    \ the first stage MT in what is essentially a sequential MT system combination\
    \ architecture. At the same time, there is a rich research literature on parallel\
    \ MT system combination where the same input is fed to multiple engines and the\
    \ best output is selected or smaller sections of the outputs are combined to obtain\
    \ improved translation output. In the paper we show that parallel system combination\
    \ in the APE stage of a sequential MT-APE combination yields substantial translation\
    \ improvements both measured in terms of automatic evaluation metrics as well\
    \ as in terms of productivity improvements measured in a post-editing experiment.\
    \ We also show that system combination on the level of APE alignments yields further\
    \ improvements. Overall our APE system yields statistically significant improvement\
    \ of 5.9% relative BLEU over a strong baseline (English\u2013Italian Google MT)\
    \ and 21.76% productivity increase in a human post-editing experiment with professional\
    \ translators."

  abstract: Research in statistical machine translation (SMT) is largely driven by
    formal translation tasks, while translating informal text is much more challenging.
    In this paper we focus on SMT for the informal genre of dialogues, which has rarely
    been addressed to date. Concretely, we investigate the effect of dialogue acts,
    speakers, gender, and text register on SMT quality when translating fictional
    dialogues. We first create and release a corpus of multilingual movie dialogues
    annotated with these four dialogue-specific aspects. When measuring translation
    performance for each of these variables, we find that BLEU fluctuations between
    their categories are often significantly larger than randomly expected. Following
    this finding, we hypothesize and show that SMT of fictional dialogues benefits
    from adaptation towards dialogue acts and registers. Finally, we find that male
    speakers are harder to translate and use more vulgar language than female speakers,
    and that vulgarity is often not preserved during translation.

  abstract: The phrase table is considered to be the main bilingual resource for the
    phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model. During translation,
    a source sentence is decomposed into several phrases. The best match of each source
    phrase is selected among several target-side counterparts within the phrase table,
    and processed by the decoder to generate a sentence-level translation. The best
    match is chosen according to several factors, including a set of bilingual features.
    PBSMT engines by default provide four probability scores in phrase tables which
    are considered as the main set of bilingual features. Our goal is to enrich that
    set of features, as a better feature set should yield better translations. We
    propose new scores generated by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which indicate
    the semantic relatedness of phrase pairs. We evaluate our model in different experimental
    settings with different language pairs. We observe significant improvements when
    the proposed features are incorporated into the PBSMT pipeline.

  abstract: "We introduce a novel task Anecdote Recognition and Recommendation. An\
    \ anecdote is a story with a point revealing account of an individual person.\
    \ Recommending proper anecdotes can be used as evidence to support argumentative\
    \ writing or as a clue for further reading. We represent an anecdote as a structured\
    \ tuple \u2014 < person, story, implication >. Anecdote recognition runs on archived\
    \ argumentative essays. We extract narratives containing events of a person as\
    \ the anecdote story. More importantly, we uncover the anecdote implication, which\
    \ reveals the meaning and topic of an anecdote. Our approach depends on discourse\
    \ role identification. Discourse roles such as thesis, main ideas and support\
    \ help us locate stories and their implications in essays. The experiments show\
    \ that informative and interpretable anecdotes can be recognized. These anecdotes\
    \ are used for anecdote recommendation. The anecdote recommender can recommend\

  abstract: "Discourse parsing is a popular technique widely used in text understanding,\
    \ sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks. However, for most discourse parsers,\
    \ the performance varies significantly across different discourse relations. In\
    \ this paper, we first validate the underfitting hypothesis, i.e., the less frequent\
    \ a relation is in the training data, the poorer the performance on that relation.\
    \ We then explore how to increase the number of positive training instances, without\
    \ resorting to manually creating additional labeled data. We propose a training\
    \ data enrichment framework that relies on co-training of two different discourse\
    \ parsers on unlabeled documents. Importantly, we show that co-training alone\
    \ is not sufficient. The framework requires a filtering step to ensure that only\
    \ \u201Cgood quality\u201D unlabeled documents can be used for enrichment and\
    \ re-training. We propose and evaluate two ways to perform the filtering. The\
    \ first is to use an agreement score between the two parsers. The second is to\
    \ use only the confidence score of the faster parser. Our empirical results show\
    \ that agreement score can help to boost the performance on infrequent relations,\
    \ and that the confidence score is a viable approximation of the agreement score\
    \ for infrequent relations."

  abstract: Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)-style annotation focuses on labeling local
    discourse relations between text spans and typically ignores larger discourse
    contexts. In this paper we propose two approaches to infer discourse relations
    in a paragraph-level context from annotated PDTB labels. We investigate the utility
    of inferring such discourse information using the task of revision classification.
    Experimental results demonstrate that the inferred information can significantly
    improve classification performance compared to baselines, not only when PDTB annotation
    comes from humans but also from automatic parsers.

  abstract: "Aspect-level analysis of sentiments contained in a review text is important\
    \ to reveal a detailed picture of consumer opinions. While a plethora of methods\
    \ have been traditionally employed for this task, majority focus has been on analyzing\
    \ only aspect-centered local information. However, incorporating context information\
    \ from non-local aspect neighbors may capture richer structure in review text\
    \ and enhance prediction. This may especially be helpful to resolve ambiguous\
    \ predictions. The context around an aspect can be incorporated using semantic\
    \ relations within text and inter-label dependencies in the output. On the output\
    \ side, this becomes a structured prediction task. However, non-local label correlations\
    \ are computationally heavy and intractable to infer for structured prediction\
    \ models like Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, some prior intuition\
    \ is required to incorporate non-local context. Thus, inspired by previous research\
    \ on multi-stage prediction, we propose a two-level model for aspect-based analysis.\
    \ The proposed model uses predicted probability estimates from first level to\
    \ incorporate neighbor information in the second level. The model is evaluated\
    \ on data taken from SemEval Workshops and Bing Liu\u2019s review collection.\
    \ It shows comparatively better performance against few existing methods. Overall,\
    \ we get prediction accuracy in a range of 83-88% and almost 3-4 point increment\
    \ against baseline (first level only) scores."

  abstract: In the literature, various supervised learning approaches have been adopted
    to address the task of reader emotion classification. However, the classification
    performance greatly suffers when the size of the labeled data is limited. In this
    paper, we propose a two-view label propagation approach to semi-supervised reader
    emotion classification by exploiting two views, namely source text and response
    text in a label propagation algorithm. Specifically, our approach depends on two
    word-document bipartite graphs to model the relationship among the samples in
    the two views respectively. Besides, the two bipartite graphs are integrated by
    linking each source text sample with its corresponding response text sample via
    a length-sensitive transition probability. In this way, our two-view label propagation
    approach to semi-supervised reader emotion classification largely alleviates the
    reliance on the strong sufficiency and independence assumptions of the two views,
    as required in co-training. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
    of our two-view label propagation approach to semi-supervised reader emotion classification.

  abstract: Classifying the stance expressed in online microblogging social media
    is an emerging problem in opinion mining. We propose a probabilistic approach
    to stance classification in tweets, which models stance, target of stance, and
    sentiment of tweet, jointly. Instead of simply conjoining the sentiment or target
    variables as extra variables to the feature space, we use a novel formulation
    to incorporate three-way interactions among sentiment-stance-input variables and
    three-way interactions among target-stance-input variables. The proposed specification
    intuitively aims to discriminate sentiment features from target features for stance
    classification. In addition, regularizing a single stance classifier, which handles
    all targets, acts as a soft weight-sharing among them. We demonstrate that discriminative
    training of this model achieves the state-of-the-art results in supervised stance
    classification, and its generative training obtains competitive results in the
    weakly supervised setting.

  abstract: An important difference between traditional AI systems and human intelligence
    is the human ability to harness commonsense knowledge gleaned from a lifetime
    of learning and experience to make informed decisions. This allows humans to adapt
    easily to novel situations where AI fails catastrophically due to a lack of situation-specific
    rules and generalization capabilities. Commonsense knowledge also provides background
    information that enables humans to successfully operate in social situations where
    such knowledge is typically assumed. Since commonsense consists of information
    that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task. Previous
    versions of SenticNet were focused on collecting this kind of knowledge for sentiment
    analysis but they were heavily limited by their inability to generalize. SenticNet
    4 overcomes such limitations by leveraging on conceptual primitives automatically
    generated by means of hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction.

  abstract: Existing work learning distributed representations of knowledge base entities
    has largely failed to incorporate rich categorical structure, and is unable to
    induce category representations. We propose a new framework that embeds entities
    and categories jointly into a semantic space, by integrating structured knowledge
    and taxonomy hierarchy from large knowledge bases. Our framework enables to compute
    meaningful semantic relatedness between entities and categories in a principled
    way, and can handle both single-word and multiple-word concepts. Our method shows
    significant improvement on the tasks of concept categorization and dataless hierarchical
    classification.

  abstract: Topic modeling and word embedding are two important techniques for deriving
    latent semantics from data. General-purpose topic models typically work in coarse
    granularity by capturing word co-occurrence at the document/sentence level. In
    contrast, word embedding models usually work in much finer granularity by modeling
    word co-occurrence within small sliding windows. With the aim of deriving latent
    semantics by considering word co-occurrence at different levels of granularity,
    we propose a novel model named Latent Topic Embedding (LTE), which seamlessly
    integrates topic generation and embedding learning in one unified framework. We
    further propose an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm to estimate the parameters
    of interest. By retaining the individual advantages of topic modeling and word
    embedding, LTE results in better latent topics and word embedding. Extensive experiments
    verify the superiority of LTE over the state-of-the-arts.

  abstract: Word embeddings have been demonstrated to benefit NLP tasks impressively.
    Yet, there is room for improvements in the vector representations, because current
    word embeddings typically contain unnecessary information, i.e., noise. We propose
    two novel models to improve word embeddings by unsupervised learning, in order
    to yield word denoising embeddings. The word denoising embeddings are obtained
    by strengthening salient information and weakening noise in the original word
    embeddings, based on a deep feed-forward neural network filter. Results from benchmark
    tasks show that the filtered word denoising embeddings outperform the original
    word embeddings.

  abstract: Semantic classification of words using distributional features is usually
    based on the semantic similarity of words. We show on two different datasets that
    a trained classifier using the distributional features directly gives better results.
    We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-relational Matrix Factorization
    (MRMF) to train classifiers. Both give similar results. However, MRMF, that was
    not used for semantic classification with distributional features before, can
    easily be extended with more matrices containing more information from different
    sources on the same problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel approach
    by including information from WordNet. Thus we show, that MRMF provides an interesting
    approach for building semantic classifiers that (1) gives better results than
    unsupervised approaches based on vector similarity, (2) gives similar results
    as other supervised methods and (3) can naturally be extended with other sources
    of information in order to improve the results.

  abstract: Prepositions are very common and very ambiguous, and understanding their
    sense is critical for understanding the meaning of the sentence. Supervised corpora
    for the preposition-sense disambiguation task are small, suggesting a semi-supervised
    approach to the task. We show that signals from unannotated multilingual data
    can be used to improve supervised preposition-sense disambiguation. Our approach
    pre-trains an LSTM encoder for predicting the translation of a preposition, and
    then incorporates the pre-trained encoder as a component in a supervised classification
    system, and fine-tunes it for the task. The multilingual signals consistently
    improve results on two preposition-sense datasets.

  abstract: 'Recognising and understanding irony is crucial for the improvement natural
    language processing tasks including sentiment analysis. In this study, we describe
    the construction of an English Twitter corpus and its annotation for irony based
    on a newly developed fine-grained annotation scheme. We also explore the feasibility
    of automatic irony recognition by exploiting a varied set of features including
    lexical, syntactic, sentiment and semantic (Word2Vec) information. Experiments
    on a held-out test set show that our irony classifier benefits from this combined
    information, yielding an F1-score of 67.66%. When explicit hashtag information
    like #irony is included in the data, the system even obtains an F1-score of 92.77%.
    A qualitative analysis of the output reveals that recognising irony that results
    from a polarity clash appears to be (much) more feasible than recognising other
    forms of ironic utterances (e.g., descriptions of situational irony).'

  abstract: When processing arguments in online user interactive discourse, it is
    often necessary to determine their bases of support. In this paper, we describe
    a supervised approach, based on deep neural networks, for classifying the claims
    made in online arguments. We conduct experiments using convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) on two claim data sets compiled
    from online user comments. Using different types of distributional word embeddings,
    but without incorporating any rich, expensive set of features, we achieve a significant
    improvement over the state of the art for one data set (which categorizes arguments
    as factual vs. emotional), and performance comparable to the state of the art
    on the other data set (which categorizes propositions according to their verifiability).
    Our approach has the advantages of using a generalized, simple, and effective
    methodology that works for claim categorization on different data sets and tasks.

  abstract: "Some expressions can be ambiguous between idiomatic and literal interpretations\
    \ depending on the context they occur in, e.g., \u2018sales hit the roof\u2019\
    \ vs. \u2018hit the roof of the car\u2019. We present a novel method of classifying\
    \ whether a given instance is literal or idiomatic, focusing on verb-noun constructions.\
    \ We report state-of-the-art results on this task using an approach based on the\
    \ hypothesis that the distributions of the contexts of the idiomatic phrases will\
    \ be different from the contexts of the literal usages. We measure contexts by\
    \ using projections of the words into vector space. For comparison, we implement\
    \ Fazly et al. (2009)\u2019s, Sporleder and Li (2009)\u2019s, and Li and Sporleder\
    \ (2010b)\u2019s methods and apply them to our data. We provide experimental results\

  abstract: Several tasks in argumentation mining and debating, question-answering,
    and natural language inference involve classifying a sequence in the context of
    another sequence (referred as bi-sequence classification). For several single
    sequence classification tasks, the current state-of-the-art approaches are based
    on recurrent and convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, for bi-sequence
    classification problems, there is not much understanding as to the best deep learning
    architecture. In this paper, we attempt to get an understanding of this category
    of problems by extensive empirical evaluation of 19 different deep learning architectures
    (specifically on different ways of handling context) for various problems originating
    in natural language processing like debating, textual entailment and question-answering.
    Following the empirical evaluation, we offer our insights and conclusions regarding
    the architectures we have considered. We also establish the first deep learning
    baselines for three argumentation mining tasks.

    into the empirically justified choice of optimal training methods and parameters.
    The overall low reliability we observe, nevertheless, casts doubt on the suitability
    of word neighborhoods in embedding spaces as a basis for qualitative conclusions
    on synchronic and diachronic lexico-semantic matters, an issue currently high
    up in the agenda of Digital Humanities.

  abstract: In this paper, we outline an approach to build graph-based reverse dictionaries
    using word definitions. A reverse dictionary takes a phrase as an input and outputs
    a list of words semantically similar to that phrase. It is a solution to the Tip-of-the-Tongue
    problem. We use a distance-based similarity measure, computed on a graph, to assess
    the similarity between a word and the input phrase. We compare the performance
    of our approach with the Onelook Reverse Dictionary and a distributional semantics
    method based on word2vec, and show that our approach is much better than the distributional
    semantics method, and as good as Onelook, on a 3k lexicon. This simple approach
    sets a new performance baseline for reverse dictionaries.

  abstract: "Human concept representations are often grounded with visual information,\
    \ yet some aspects of meaning cannot be visually represented or are better described\
    \ with language. Thus, vision and language provide complementary information that,\
    \ properly combined, can potentially yield more complete concept representations.\
    \ Recently, state-of-the-art distributional semantic models and convolutional\
    \ neural networks have achieved great success in representing linguistic and visual\
    \ knowledge respectively. In this paper, we compare both, visual and linguistic\
    \ representations in their ability to capture different types of fine-grain semantic\
    \ knowledge\u2014or attributes\u2014of concepts. Humans often describe objects\
    \ using attributes, that is, properties such as shape, color or functionality,\
    \ which often transcend the linguistic and visual modalities. In our setting,\
    \ we evaluate how well attributes can be predicted by using the unimodal representations\
    \ as inputs. We are interested in first, finding out whether attributes are generally\
    \ better captured by either the vision or by the language modality; and second,\
    \ if none of them is clearly superior (as we hypothesize), what type of attributes\
    \ or semantic knowledge are better encoded from each modality. Ultimately, our\
    \ study sheds light on the potential of combining visual and textual representations."

  abstract: Temporal relation classification is a challenging task, especially when
    there are no explicit markers to characterise the relation between temporal entities.
    This occurs frequently in inter-sentential relations, whose entities are not connected
    via direct syntactic relations making classification even more difficult. In these
    cases, resorting to features that focus on the semantic content of the event words
    may be very beneficial for inferring implicit relations. Specifically, while morpho-syntactic
    and context features are considered sufficient for classifying event-timex pairs,
    we believe that exploiting distributional semantic information about event words
    can benefit supervised classification of other types of pairs. In this work, we
    assess the impact of using word embeddings as features for event words in classifying
    temporal relations of event-event pairs and event-DCT (document creation time)
    pairs.

  abstract: This paper proposes a novel problem setting of selectional preference
    (SP) between a predicate and its arguments, called as context-sensitive SP (CSP).
    CSP models the narrative consistency between the predicate and preceding contexts
    of its arguments, in addition to the conventional SP based on semantic types.
    Furthermore, we present a novel CSP model that extends the neural SP model (Van
    de Cruys, 2014) to incorporate contextual information into the distributed representations
    of arguments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CSP model successfully
    learns CSP and outperforms the conventional SP model in coreference cluster ranking.

  abstract: The paper presents an iterative bidirectional clustering of adjectives
    and nouns based on a co-occurrence matrix. The clustering method combines a Vector
    Space Models (VSM) and the results of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), whose
    results are merged in each iterative step. The aim is to derive a clustering of
    German adjectives that reflects latent semantic classes of adjectives, and that
    can be used to induce frame-based representations of nouns in a later step. We
    are able to show that the method induces meaningful groups of adjectives, and
    that it outperforms a baseline k-means algorithm.

    \ This paper focuses on inclusion properties of tensors; its main contribution\
    \ is a theoretical and experimental analysis of how feature inclusion works in\
    \ different concrete models of verb tensors. We present results for relational,\

  abstract: "Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is a fundamentally important task\
    \ in natural language processing that has many applications. The recently released\
    \ Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus has made it possible to develop\
    \ and evaluate deep neural network methods for the RTE task. Previous neural network\
    \ based methods usually try to encode the two sentences (premise and hypothesis)\
    \ and send them together into a multi-layer perceptron to get their entailment\
    \ type, or use LSTM-RNN to link two sentences together while using attention mechanic\
    \ to enhance the model\u2019s ability. In this paper, we propose to use the re-read\
    \ mechanic, which means to read the premise again and again while reading the\
    \ hypothesis. After read the premise again, the model can get a better understanding\
    \ of the premise, which can also affect the understanding of the hypothesis. On\
    \ the contrary, a better understanding of the hypothesis can also affect the understanding\
    \ of the premise. With the alternative re-read process, the model can \u201Cthink\u201D\
    \ of a better decision of entailment type. We designed a new LSTM unit called\
    \ re-read LSTM (rLSTM) to implement this \u201Cthinking\u201D process. Experiments\
    \ show that we achieve results better than current state-of-the-art equivalents."

  abstract: Existing systems deliver high accuracy and F1-scores for detecting paraphrase
    and semantic similarity on traditional clean-text corpus. For instance, on the
    clean-text Microsoft Paraphrase benchmark database, the existing systems attain
    an accuracy as high as 0:8596. However, existing systems for detecting paraphrases
    and semantic similarity on user-generated short-text content on microblogs such
    as Twitter, comprising of noisy and ad hoc short-text, needs significant research
    attention. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach towards
    this. We propose a set of features that, although well-known in the NLP literature
    for solving other problems, have not been explored for detecting paraphrase or
    semantic similarity, on noisy user-generated short-text data such as Twitter.
    We apply support vector machine (SVM) based learning. We use the benchmark Twitter
    paraphrase data, released as a part of SemEval 2015, for experiments. Our system
    delivers a paraphrase detection F1-score of 0.717 and semantic similarity detection
    F1-score of 0.741, thereby significantly outperforming the existing systems, that
    deliver F1-scores of 0.696 and 0.724 for the two problems respectively. Our features
    also allow us to obtain a rank among the top-10, when trained on the Microsoft
    Paraphrase corpus and tested on the corresponding test data, thereby empirically
    establishing our approach as ubiquitous across the different paraphrase detection
    databases.

  abstract: Sentence intersection captures the semantic overlap of two texts, generalizing
    over paradigms such as textual entailment and semantic text similarity. Despite
    its modeling power, it has received little attention because it is difficult for
    non-experts to annotate. We analyze 200 pairs of similar sentences and identify
    several underlying properties of sentence intersection. We leverage these insights
    to design an algorithm that decomposes the sentence intersection task into several
    simpler annotation tasks, facilitating the construction of a high quality dataset
    via crowdsourcing. We implement this approach and provide an annotated dataset
    of 1,764 sentence intersections.

  abstract: "Inference rule discovery aims to identify entailment relations between\
    \ predicates, e.g., \u2018X acquire Y \u2013> X purchase Y\u2019 and \u2018X is\
    \ author of Y \u2013> X write Y\u2019. Traditional methods dis-cover inference\
    \ rules by computing distributional similarities between predicates, with each\
    \ predicate is represented as one or more feature vectors of its instantiations.\
    \ These methods, however, have two main drawbacks. Firstly, these methods are\
    \ mostly context-insensitive, cannot accurately measure the similarity between\
    \ two predicates in a specific context. Secondly, traditional methods usually\
    \ model predicates independently, ignore the rich inter-dependencies between predicates.\
    \ To address the above two issues, this pa-per proposes a graph-based method,\
    \ which can discover inference rules by effectively modelling and exploiting both\
    \ the context and the inter-dependencies between predicates. Specifically, we\
    \ propose a graph-based representation\u2014Predicate Graph, which can capture\
    \ the semantic relevance between predicates using both the predicate-feature co-occurrence\
    \ statistics and the inter-dependencies between predicates. Based on the predicate\
    \ graph, we propose a context-sensitive random walk algorithm, which can learn\
    \ con-text-specific predicate representations by distinguishing context-relevant\
    \ information from context-irrelevant information. Experimental results show that\
    \ our method significantly outperforms traditional inference rule discovery methods."

  abstract: 'We describe an attentive encoder that combines tree-structured recursive
    neural networks and sequential recurrent neural networks for modelling sentence
    pairs. Since existing attentive models exert attention on the sequential structure,
    we propose a way to incorporate attention into the tree topology. Specially, given
    a pair of sentences, our attentive encoder uses the representation of one sentence,
    which generated via an RNN, to guide the structural encoding of the other sentence
    on the dependency parse tree. We evaluate the proposed attentive encoder on three
    tasks: semantic similarity, paraphrase identification and true-false question
    selection. Experimental results show that our encoder outperforms all baselines
    and achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel neural approach for paraphrase generation.
    Conventional paraphrase generation methods either leverage hand-written rules
    and thesauri-based alignments, or use statistical machine learning principles.
    To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore deep learning
    models for paraphrase generation. Our primary contribution is a stacked residual
    LSTM network, where we add residual connections between LSTM layers. This allows
    for efficient training of deep LSTMs. We evaluate our model and other state-of-the-art
    deep learning models on three different datasets: PPDB, WikiAnswers, and MSCOCO.
    Evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms sequence to sequence,
    attention-based, and bi-directional LSTM models on BLEU, METEOR, TER, and an embedding-based
    sentence similarity metric.'

  abstract: Knowledge base (KB) such as Freebase plays an important role for many
    natural language processing tasks. English knowledge base is obviously larger
    and of higher quality than low resource language like Chinese. To expand Chinese
    KB by leveraging English KB resources, an effective way is to translate English
    KB (source) into Chinese (target). In this direction, two major challenges are
    to model triple semantics and to build a robust KB translator. We address these
    challenges by presenting a neural network approach, which learns continuous triple
    representation with a gated neural network. Accordingly, source triples and target
    triples are mapped in the same semantic vector space. We build a new dataset for
    English-Chinese KB translation from Freebase, and compare with several baselines
    on it. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves translation
    accuracy compared with baseline methods. We show that adaptive composition model
    improves standard solution such as neural tensor network in terms of translation
    accuracy.

  abstract: Keyphrase annotation is the task of identifying textual units that represent
    the main content of a document. Keyphrase annotation is either carried out by
    extracting the most important phrases from a document, keyphrase extraction, or
    by assigning entries from a controlled domain-specific vocabulary, keyphrase assignment.
    Assignment methods are generally more reliable. They provide better-formed keyphrases,
    as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document. But they are often silent
    on the contrary of extraction methods that do not depend on manually built resources.
    This paper proposes a new method to perform both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase
    assignment in an integrated and mutual reinforcing manner. Experiments have been
    carried out on datasets covering different domains of humanities and social sciences.
    They show statistically significant improvements compared to both keyphrase extraction
    and keyphrase assignment state-of-the art methods.

  abstract: QA systems have been making steady advances in the challenging elementary
    science exam domain. In this work, we develop an explanation-based analysis of
    knowledge and inference requirements, which supports a fine-grained characterization
    of the challenges. In particular, we model the requirements based on appropriate
    sources of evidence to be used for the QA task. We create requirements by first
    identifying suitable sentences in a knowledge base that support the correct answer,
    then use these to build explanations, filling in any necessary missing information.
    These explanations are used to create a fine-grained categorization of the requirements.
    Using these requirements, we compare a retrieval and an inference solver on 212
    questions. The analysis validates the gains of the inference solver, demonstrating
    that it answers more questions requiring complex inference, while also providing
    insights into the relative strengths of the solvers and knowledge sources. We
    release the annotated questions and explanations as a resource with broad utility
    for science exam QA, including determining knowledge base construction targets,
    as well as supporting information aggregation in automated inference.

    \ issues, and reactions concerning national and international events. Given the\

    \ or neglect to say, they must craft and time their tweets carefully. The content\
    \ and delivery of these tweets is therefore highly indicative of a politician\u2019\

  abstract: "Sentiment classification becomes more and more important with the rapid\
    \ growth of user generated content. However, sentiment classification task usually\
    \ comes with two challenges: first, sentiment classification is highly domain-dependent\
    \ and training sentiment classifier for every domain is inefficient and often\
    \ impractical; second, since the quantity of labeled data is important for assessing\
    \ the quality of classifier, it is hard to evaluate classifiers when labeled data\
    \ is limited for certain domains. To address the challenges mentioned above, we\
    \ focus on learning high-level features that are able to generalize across domains,\
    \ so a global classifier can benefit with a simple combination of documents from\
    \ multiple domains. In this paper, the proposed model incorporates both sentiment\
    \ polarity and unlabeled data from multiple domains and learns new feature representations.\
    \ Our model doesn\u2019t require labels from every domain, which means the learned\
    \ feature representation can be generalized for sentiment domain adaptation. In\
    \ addition, the learned feature representation can be used as classifier since\
    \ our model defines the meaning of feature value and arranges high-level features\
    \ in a prefixed order, so it is not necessary to train another classifier on top\
    \ of the new features. Empirical evaluations demonstrate our model outperforms\
    \ baselines and yields competitive results to other state-of-the-art works on\
    \ benchmark datasets."

  abstract: This paper presents classification results for the analysis of sentiment
    in political news articles. The domain of political news is particularly challenging,
    as journalists are presumably objective, whilst at the same time opinions can
    be subtly expressed. To deal with this challenge, in this work we conduct a two-step
    classification model, distinguishing first subjective and second positive and
    negative sentiment texts. More specifically, we propose a shallow machine learning
    approach where only minimal features are needed to train the classifier, including
    sentiment-bearing Co-Occurring Terms (COTs) and negation words. This approach
    yields close to state-of-the-art results. Contrary to results in other domains,
    the use of negations as features does not have a positive impact in the evaluation
    results. This method is particularly suited for languages that suffer from a lack
    of resources, such as sentiment lexicons or parsers, and for those systems that
    need to function in real-time.

  abstract: Probabilistic models are a useful means for analyzing large text corpora.
    Integrating such models with human interaction enables many new use cases. However,
    adding human interaction to probabilistic models requires inference algorithms
    which are both fast and accurate. We explore the use of Iterated Conditional Modes
    as a fast alternative to Gibbs sampling or variational EM. We demonstrate superior
    performance both in run time and model quality on three different models of text
    including a DP Mixture of Multinomials for web search result clustering, the Interactive
    Topic Model, and M OM R ESP , a multinomial crowdsourcing model.

  abstract: In this paper we address a new problem of predicting affect and well-being
    scales in a real-world setting of heterogeneous, longitudinal and non-synchronous
    textual as well as non-linguistic data that can be harvested from on-line media
    and mobile phones. We describe the method for collecting the heterogeneous longitudinal
    data, how features are extracted to address missing information and differences
    in temporal alignment, and how the latter are combined to yield promising predictions
    of affect and well-being on the basis of widely used psychological scales. We
    achieve a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71-0.76 and a correlation coefficient
    of 0.68-0.87 which is higher than the state-of-the art in equivalent multi-modal
    tasks for affect.) of 0.71-0.76 and a correlation coefficient of 0.68-0.87 which
    is higher than the state-of-the art in equivalent multi-modal tasks for affect.

  abstract: Microblogging services allow users to create hashtags to categorize their
    posts. In recent years, the task of recommending hashtags for microblogs has been
    given increasing attention. However, most of existing methods depend on hand-crafted
    features. Motivated by the successful use of long short-term memory (LSTM) for
    many natural language processing tasks, in this paper, we adopt LSTM to learn
    the representation of a microblog post. Observing that hashtags indicate the primary
    topics of microblog posts, we propose a novel attention-based LSTM model which
    incorporates topic modeling into the LSTM architecture through an attention mechanism.
    We evaluate our model using a large real-world dataset. Experimental results show
    that our model significantly outperforms various competitive baseline methods.
    Furthermore, the incorporation of topical attention mechanism gives more than
    7.4% improvement in F1 score compared with standard LSTM method.

  abstract: "We present a novel way for designing complex joint inference and learning\
    \ models using Saul (Kordjamshidi et al., 2015), a recently-introduced declarative\
    \ learning-based programming language (DeLBP). We enrich Saul with components\
    \ that are necessary for a broad range of learning based Natural Language Processing\
    \ tasks at various levels of granularity. We illustrate these advances using three\
    \ different, well-known NLP problems, and show how these generic learning and\
    \ inference modules can directly exploit Saul\u2019s graph-based data representation.\
    \ These properties allow the programmer to easily switch between different model\
    \ formulations and configurations, and consider various kinds of dependencies\
    \ and correlations among variables of interest with minimal programming effort.\
    \ We argue that Saul provides an extremely useful paradigm both for the design\
    \ of advanced NLP systems and for supporting advanced research in NLP."

  abstract: In this paper, we provide a solution to multilingual sentiment classification
    using deep learning. Given input text in a language, we use word translation into
    English and then the embeddings of these English words to train a classifier.
    This projection into the English space plus word embeddings gives a simple and
    uniform framework for multilingual sentiment analysis. A novel idea is augmentation
    of the training data with polar words, appearing in these sentences, along with
    their polarities. This approach leads to a performance gain of 7-10% over traditional
    classifiers on many languages, irrespective of text genre, despite the scarcity
    of resources in most languages.

  abstract: 'Estimating similarities at different levels of linguistic units, such
    as words, sub-phrases and phrases, is helpful for measuring semantic similarity
    of an entire bilingual phrase. In this paper, we propose a convolution-enhanced
    bilingual recursive neural network (ConvBRNN), which not only exploits word alignments
    to guide the generation of phrase structures but also integrates multiple-level
    information of the generated phrase structures into bilingual semantic modeling.
    In order to accurately learn the semantic hierarchy of a bilingual phrase, we
    develop a recursive neural network to constrain the learned bilingual phrase structures
    to be consistent with word alignments. Upon the generated source and target phrase
    structures, we stack a convolutional neural network to integrate vector representations
    of linguistic units on the structures into bilingual phrase embeddings. After
    that, we fully incorporate information of different linguistic units into a bilinear
    semantic similarity model. We introduce two max-margin losses to train the ConvBRNN
    model: one for the phrase structure inference and the other for the semantic similarity
    model. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate the high
    quality of the generated bilingual phrase structures with respect to word alignments
    and the effectiveness of learned semantic similarities on machine translation.'

  abstract: "In neural machine translation, the attention mechanism facilitates the\
    \ translation process by producing a soft alignment between the source sentence\
    \ and the target sentence. However, without dedicated distortion and fertility\
    \ models seen in traditional SMT systems, the learned alignment may not be accurate,\
    \ which can lead to low translation quality. In this paper, we propose two novel\
    \ models to improve attention-based neural machine translation. We propose a recurrent\
    \ attention mechanism as an implicit distortion model, and a fertility conditioned\
    \ decoder as an implicit fertility model. We conduct experiments on large-scale\
    \ Chinese\u2013English translation tasks. The results show that our models significantly\
    \ improve both the alignment and translation quality compared to the original\
    \ attention mechanism and several other variations."

  abstract: The attention mechanism is appealing for neural machine translation, since
    it is able to dynamically encode a source sentence by generating a alignment between
    a target word and source words. Unfortunately, it has been proved to be worse
    than conventional alignment models in alignment accuracy. In this paper, we analyze
    and explain this issue from the point view of reordering, and propose a supervised
    attention which is learned with guidance from conventional alignment models. Experiments
    on two Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that the supervised attention
    mechanism yields better alignments leading to substantial gains over the standard
    attention based NMT.

  abstract: Evaluating the quality of output from language processing systems such
    as machine translation or speech recognition is an essential step in ensuring
    that they are sufficient for practical use. However, depending on the practical
    requirements, evaluation approaches can differ strongly. Often, reference-based
    evaluation measures (such as BLEU or WER) are appealing because they are cheap
    and allow rapid quantitative comparison. On the other hand, practitioners often
    focus on manual evaluation because they must deal with frequently changing domains
    and quality standards requested by customers, for which reference-based evaluation
    is insufficient or not possible due to missing in-domain reference data (Harris
    et al., 2016). In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a framework
    for lightly supervised quality estimation. We collect manually annotated scores
    for a small number of segments in a test corpus or document, and combine them
    with automatically predicted quality scores for the remaining segments to predict
    an overall quality estimate. An evaluation shows that our framework estimates
    quality more reliably than using fully automatic quality estimation approaches,
    while keeping annotation effort low by not requiring full references to be available
    for the particular domain.

  abstract: 'Selecting appropriate translations for source words with multiple meanings
    still remains a challenge for statistical machine translation (SMT). One reason
    for this is that most SMT systems are not good at detecting the proper sense for
    a polysemic word when it appears in different contexts. In this paper, we adopt
    a supersense tagging method to annotate source words with coarse-grained ontological
    concepts. In order to enable the system to choose an appropriate translation for
    a word or phrase according to the annotated supersense of the word or phrase,
    we propose two translation models with supersense knowledge: a maximum entropy
    based model and a supersense embedding model. The effectiveness of our proposed
    models is validated on a large-scale English-to-Spanish translation task. Results
    indicate that our method can significantly improve translation quality via correctly
    conveying the meaning of the source language to the target language.'

  abstract: Human-targeted metrics provide a compromise between human evaluation of
    machine translation, where high inter-annotator agreement is difficult to achieve,
    and fully automatic metrics, such as BLEU or TER, that lack the validity of human
    assessment. Human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is by far the most widely
    employed human-targeted metric in machine translation, commonly employed, for
    example, as a gold standard in evaluation of quality estimation. Original experiments
    justifying the design of HTER, as opposed to other possible formulations, were
    limited to a small sample of translations and a single language pair, however,
    and this motivates our re-evaluation of a range of human-targeted metrics on a
    substantially larger scale. Results show significantly stronger correlation with
    human judgment for HBLEU over HTER for two of the nine language pairs we include
    and no significant difference between correlations achieved by HTER and HBLEU
    for the remaining language pairs. Finally, we evaluate a range of quality estimation
    systems employing HTER and direct assessment (DA) of translation adequacy as gold
    labels, resulting in a divergence in system rankings, and propose employment of
    DA for future quality estimation evaluations.

  abstract: Although more additional corpora are now available for Statistical Machine
    Translation (SMT), only the ones which belong to the same or similar domains of
    the original corpus can indeed enhance SMT performance directly. A series of SMT
    adaptation methods have been proposed to select these similar-domain data, and
    most of them focus on sentence selection. In comparison, phrase is a smaller and
    more fine grained unit for data selection, therefore we propose a straightforward
    and efficient connecting phrase based adaptation method, which is applied to both
    bilingual phrase pair and monolingual n-gram adaptation. The proposed method is
    evaluated on IWSLT/NIST data sets, and the results show that phrase based SMT
    performances are significantly improved (up to +1.6 in comparison with phrase
    based SMT baseline system and +0.9 in comparison with existing methods).

  abstract: We present a new Bayesian HMM word alignment model for statistical machine
    translation. The model is a mixture of an alignment model and a language model.
    The alignment component is a Bayesian extension of the standard HMM. The language
    model component is responsible for the generation of words needed for source fluency
    reasons from source language context. This allows for untranslatable source words
    to remain unaligned and at the same time avoids the introduction of artificial
    NULL words which introduces unusually long alignment jumps. Existing Bayesian
    word alignment models are unpractically slow because they consider each target
    position when resampling a given alignment link. The sampling complexity therefore
    grows linearly in the target sentence length. In order to make our model useful
    in practice, we devise an auxiliary variable Gibbs sampler that allows us to resample
    alignment links in constant time independently of the target sentence length.
    This leads to considerable speed improvements. Experimental results show that
    our model performs as well as existing word alignment toolkits in terms of resulting
    BLEU score.

  abstract: We present an approach for learning to translate by exploiting cross-lingual
    link structure in multilingual document collections. We propose a new learning
    objective based on structured ramp loss, which learns from graded relevance, explicitly
    including negative relevance information. Our results on English German translation
    of Wikipedia entries show small, but significant, improvements of our method over
    an unadapted baseline, even when only a weak relevance signal is used. We also
    compare our method to monolingual language model adaptation and automatic pseudo-parallel
    data extraction and find small improvements even over these strong baselines.

  abstract: In this paper we explore the novel idea of building a single universal
    reordering model from English to a large number of target languages. To build
    this model we exploit typological features of word order for a large number of
    target languages together with source (English) syntactic features and we train
    this model on a single combined parallel corpus representing all (22) involved
    language pairs. We contribute experimental evidence for the usefulness of linguistically
    defined typological features for building such a model. When the universal reordering
    model is used for preordering followed by monotone translation (no reordering
    inside the decoder), our experiments show that this pipeline gives comparable
    or improved translation performance with a phrase-based baseline for a large number
    of language pairs (12 out of 22) from diverse language families.

  abstract: We present a novel fusion model for domain adaptation in Statistical Machine
    Translation. Our model is based on the joint source-target neural network Devlin
    et al., 2014, and is learned by fusing in- and out-domain models. The adaptation
    is performed by backpropagating errors from the output layer to the word embedding
    layer of each model, subsequently adjusting parameters of the composite model
    towards the in-domain data. On the standard tasks of translating English-to-German
    and Arabic-to-English TED talks, we observed average improvements of +0.9 and
    +0.7 BLEU points, respectively over a competition grade phrase-based system. We
    also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods.

    \ capability to handle multiple alternative word translations in a natural form\

  abstract: "Traditional machine translation systems often require heavy feature engineering\
    \ and the combination of multiple techniques for solving different subproblems.\
    \ In recent years, several end-to-end learning architectures based on recurrent\
    \ neural networks have been proposed. Unlike traditional systems, Neural Machine\
    \ Translation (NMT) systems learn the parameters of the model and require only\
    \ minimal preprocessing. Memory and time constraints allow to take only a fixed\
    \ number of words into account, which leads to the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.\
    \ In this work, we analyze why the OOV problem arises and why it is considered\
    \ a serious problem in German. We study the effectiveness of compound word splitters\
    \ for alleviating the OOV problem, resulting in a 2.5+ BLEU points improvement\
    \ over a baseline on the WMT\u201914 German-to-English translation task. For English-to-German\
    \ translation, we use target-side compound splitting through a special syntax\
    \ during training that allows the model to merge compound words and gain 0.2 BLEU\
    \ points."

  abstract: Measuring the information content of news text is useful for decision
    makers in their investments since news information can influence the intrinsic
    values of companies. We propose a model to automatically measure the information
    content given news text, trained using news and corresponding cumulative abnormal
    returns of listed companies. Existing methods in finance literature exploit sentiment
    signal features, which are limited by not considering factors such as events.
    We address this issue by leveraging deep neural models to extract rich semantic
    features from news text. In particular, a novel tree-structured LSTM is used to
    find target-specific representations of news text given syntax structures. Empirical
    results show that the neural models can outperform sentiment-based models, demonstrating
    the effectiveness of recent NLP technology advances for computational finance.

  abstract: News portals, such as Yahoo News or Google News, collect large amounts
    of documents from a variety of sources on a daily basis. Only a small portion
    of these documents can be selected and displayed on the homepage. Thus, there
    is a strong preference for major, recent events. In this work, we propose a scalable
    and accurate First Story Detection (FSD) pipeline that identifies fresh news.
    In comparison to other FSD systems, our method relies on relation extraction methods
    exploiting entities and their relations. We evaluate our pipeline using two distinct
    datasets from Yahoo News and Google News. Experimental results demonstrate that
    our method improves over the state-of-the-art systems on both datasets with constant
    space and time requirements.

  abstract: The appropriate use of collocations is a challenge for second language
    acquisition. However, high quality and easily accessible Chinese collocation resources
    are not available for both teachers and students. This paper presents the design
    and construction of a large scale resource of Chinese collocational knowledge,
    and a web-based application (OCCA, Online Chinese Collocation Assistant) which
    offers free and convenient collocation search service to end users. We define
    and classify collocations based on practical language acquisition needs and utilize
    a syntax based method to extract nine types of collocations. Totally 37 extraction
    rules are compiled with word, POS and dependency relation features, 1,750,000
    collocations are extracted from a corpus for L2 learning and complementary Wikipedia
    data, and OCCA is implemented based on these extracted collocations. By comparing
    OCCA with two traditional collocation dictionaries, we find OCCA has higher entry
    coverage and collocation quantity, and our method achieves quite low error rate
    at less than 5%. We also discuss how to apply collocational knowledge to grammatical
    error detection and demonstrate comparable performance to the best results in
    2015 NLP-TEA CGED shared task. The preliminary experiment shows that the collocation
    knowledge is helpful in detecting all the four types of grammatical errors.

  abstract: Event coreference resolution is a challenging problem since it relies
    on several components of the information extraction pipeline that typically yield
    noisy outputs. We hypothesize that exploiting the inter-dependencies between these
    components can significantly improve the performance of an event coreference resolver,
    and subsequently propose a novel joint inference based event coreference resolver
    using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). However, the rich features that are important
    for this task are typically very hard to explicitly encode as MLN formulas since
    they significantly increase the size of the MLN, thereby making joint inference
    and learning infeasible. To address this problem, we propose a novel solution
    where we implicitly encode rich features into our model by augmenting the MLN
    distribution with low dimensional unit clauses. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
    results on two standard evaluation corpora.

  abstract: Machine learning-based methods have obtained great progress on emotion
    classification. However, in most previous studies, the models are learned based
    on a single corpus which often suffers from insufficient labeled data. In this
    paper, we propose a corpus fusion approach to address emotion classification across
    two corpora which use different emotion taxonomies. The objective of this approach
    is to utilize the annotated data from one corpus to help the emotion classification
    on another corpus. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization is proposed
    to refine the classification results. Empirical studies show the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach to corpus fusion for emotion classification.

  abstract: 'Target-dependent sentiment classification remains a challenge: modeling
    the semantic relatedness of a target with its context words in a sentence. Different
    context words have different influences on determining the sentiment polarity
    of a sentence towards the target. Therefore, it is desirable to integrate the
    connections between target word and context words when building a learning system.
    In this paper, we develop two target dependent long short-term memory (LSTM) models,
    where target information is automatically taken into account. We evaluate our
    methods on a benchmark dataset from Twitter. Empirical results show that modeling
    sentence representation with standard LSTM does not perform well. Incorporating
    target information into LSTM can significantly boost the classification accuracy.
    The target-dependent LSTM models achieve state-of-the-art performances without
    using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons.'

  abstract: Video event detection is a challenging problem in information and multimedia
    retrieval. Different from single action detection, event detection requires a
    richer level of semantic information from video. In order to overcome this challenge,
    existing solutions often represent videos using high level features such as concepts.
    However, concept-based representation can be confusing because it does not encode
    the relationship between concepts. This issue can be addressed by exploiting the
    co-occurrences of the concepts, however, it often leads to a very huge number
    of possible combinations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to obtain the
    relationship between concepts by exploiting the syntactic dependencies between
    words in the image captions. The main advantage of this approach is that it significantly
    reduces the number of informative combinations between concepts. We conduct extensive
    experiments to analyze the effectiveness of using the new dependency representation
    for event detection on two large-scale TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2013
    and 2014 datasets. Experimental results show that i) Dependency features are more
    discriminative than concept-based features. ii) Dependency features can be combined
    with our current event detection system to further improve the performance. For
    instance, the relative improvement can be as far as 8.6% on the MEDTEST14 10Ex
    setting.

  abstract: Accurate prediction of user attributes from social media is valuable for
    both social science analysis and consumer targeting. In this paper, we propose
    a systematic method to leverage user online social media content for predicting
    offline restaurant consumption level. We utilize the social login as a bridge
    and construct a dataset of 8,844 users who have been linked across Dianping (similar
    to Yelp) and Sina Weibo. More specifically, we construct consumption level ground
    truth based on user self report spending. We build predictive models using both
    raw features and, especially, latent features, such as topic distributions and
    celebrities clusters. The employed methods demonstrate that online social media
    content has strong predictive power for offline spending. Finally, combined with
    qualitative feature analysis, we present the differences in words usage, topic
    interests and following behavior between different consumption level groups.

  abstract: "Recently, topic modeling has been widely applied in data mining due to\
    \ its powerful ability. A common, major challenge in applying such topic models\
    \ to other tasks is to accurately interpret the meaning of each topic. Topic labeling,\
    \ as a major interpreting method, has attracted significant attention recently.\
    \ However, most of previous works only focus on the effectiveness of topic labeling,\
    \ and less attention has been paid to quickly creating good topic descriptors;\
    \ meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to assign labels for new emerging topics by using\
    \ most of existing methods. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a novel fast topic labeling framework that casts the labeling problem as a k-nearest\
    \ neighbor (KNN) search problem in a probability vector set. Our experimental\
    \ results show that the proposed sequential interleaving method based on locality\
    \ sensitive hashing (LSH) technology is efficient in boosting the comparison speed\
    \ among probability distributions, and the proposed framework can generate meaningful\
    \ labels to interpret topics, including new emerging topics."

  abstract: "Using neural networks to generate replies in human-computer dialogue\
    \ systems is attracting increasing attention over the past few years. However,\
    \ the performance is not satisfactory: the neural network tends to generate safe,\
    \ universally relevant replies which carry little meaning. In this paper, we propose\
    \ a content-introducing approach to neural network-based generative dialogue systems.\
    \ We first use pointwise mutual information (PMI) to predict a noun as a keyword,\
    \ reflecting the main gist of the reply. We then propose seq2BF, a \u201Csequence\
    \ to backward and forward sequences\u201D model, which generates a reply containing\
    \ the given keyword. Experimental results show that our approach significantly\
    \ outperforms traditional sequence-to-sequence models in terms of human evaluation\
    \ and the entropy measure, and that the predicted keyword can appear at an appropriate\
    \ position in the reply."

  abstract: 'Situated dialogue systems that interact with humans as part of a team
    (e.g., robot teammates) need to be able to use information from communication
    channels to gauge the coordination level and effectiveness of the team. Currently,
    the feasibility of this end goal is limited by several gaps in both the empirical
    and computational literature. The purpose of this paper is to address those gaps
    in the following ways: (1) investigate which properties of task-oriented discourse
    correspond with effective performance in human teams, and (2) discuss how and
    to what extent these properties can be utilized in spoken dialogue systems. To
    this end, we analyzed natural language data from a unique corpus of spontaneous,
    task-oriented dialogue (CReST corpus), which was annotated for disfluencies and
    conversational moves. We found that effective teams made more self-repair disfluencies
    and used specific communication strategies to facilitate grounding and coordination.
    Our results indicate that truly robust and natural dialogue systems will need
    to interpret highly disfluent utterances and also utilize specific collaborative
    mechanisms to facilitate grounding. These data shed light on effective communication
    in performance scenarios and directly inform the development of robust dialogue
    systems for situated artificial agents.'

  abstract: We present a novel response generation system. The system assumes the
    hypothesis that participants in a conversation base their response not only on
    previous dialog utterances but also on their background knowledge. Our model is
    based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is trained over concatenated sequences
    of comments, a Convolution Neural Network that is trained over Wikipedia sentences
    and a formulation that couples the two trained embeddings in a multimodal space.
    We create a dataset of aligned Wikipedia sentences and sequences of Reddit utterances,
    which we we use to train our model. Given a sequence of past utterances and a
    set of sentences that represent the background knowledge, our end-to-end learnable
    model is able to generate context-sensitive and knowledge-driven responses by
    leveraging the alignment of two different data sources. Our approach achieves
    up to 55% improvement in perplexity compared to purely sequential models based
    on RNNs that are trained only on sequences of utterances.

  abstract: Named-Entity Recognition (NER) is still a challenging task for languages
    with low digital resources. The main difficulties arise from the scarcity of annotated
    corpora and the consequent problematic training of an effective NER pipeline.
    To abridge this gap, in this paper we target the Persian language that is spoken
    by a population of over a hundred million people world-wide. We first present
    and provide ArmanPerosNERCorpus, the first manually-annotated Persian NER corpus.
    Then, we introduce PersoNER, an NER pipeline for Persian that leverages a word
    embedding and a sequential max-margin classifier. The experimental results show
    that the proposed approach is capable of achieving interesting MUC7 and CoNNL
    scores while outperforming two alternatives based on a CRF and a recurrent neural
    network.

  abstract: This paper proposes OCR++, an open-source framework designed for a variety
    of information extraction tasks from scholarly articles including metadata (title,
    author names, affiliation and e-mail), structure (section headings and body text,
    table and figure headings, URLs and footnotes) and bibliography (citation instances
    and references). We analyze a diverse set of scientific articles written in English
    to understand generic writing patterns and formulate rules to develop this hybrid
    framework. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed framework outperforms
    the existing state-of-the-art tools by a large margin in structural information
    extraction along with improved performance in metadata and bibliography extraction
    tasks, both in terms of accuracy (around 50% improvement) and processing time
    (around 52% improvement). A user experience study conducted with the help of 30
    researchers reveals that the researchers found this system to be very helpful.
    As an additional objective, we discuss two novel use cases including automatically
    extracting links to public datasets from the proceedings, which would further
    accelerate the advancement in digital libraries. The result of the framework can
    be exported as a whole into structured TEI-encoded documents. Our framework is
    accessible online at http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/OCR++/home/.

  abstract: Comparable corpora are the main alternative to the use of parallel corpora
    to extract bilingual lexicons. Although it is easier to build comparable corpora,
    specialized comparable corpora are often of modest size in comparison with corpora
    issued from the general domain. Consequently, the observations of word co-occurrences
    which are the basis of context-based methods are unreliable. We propose in this
    article to improve word co-occurrences of specialized comparable corpora and thus
    context representation by using general-domain data. This idea, which has been
    already used in machine translation task for more than a decade, is not straightforward
    for the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from specific-domain comparable corpora.
    We go against the mainstream of this task where many studies support the idea
    that adding out-of-domain documents decreases the quality of lexicons. Our empirical
    evaluation shows the advantages of this approach which induces a significant gain
    in the accuracy of extracted lexicons.

  abstract: In this paper we present a newly developed tool that enables researchers
    interested in spatial variation of language to define a geographic perimeter of
    interest, collect data from the Twitter streaming API published in that perimeter,
    filter the obtained data by language and country, define and extract variables
    of interest and analyse the extracted variables by one spatial statistic and two
    spatial visualisations. We showcase the tool on the area and a selection of languages
    spoken in former Yugoslavia. By defining the perimeter, languages and a series
    of linguistic variables of interest we demonstrate the data collection, processing
    and analysis capabilities of the tool.

  abstract: WordNet is probably the best known lexical resource in Natural Language
    Processing. While it is widely regarded as a high quality repository of concepts
    and semantic relations, updating and extending it manually is costly. One important
    type of relation which could potentially add enormous value to WordNet is the
    inclusion of collocational information, which is paramount in tasks such as Machine
    Translation, Natural Language Generation and Second Language Learning. In this
    paper, we present ColWordNet (CWN), an extended WordNet version with fine-grained
    collocational information, automatically introduced thanks to a method exploiting
    linear relations between analogous sense-level embeddings spaces. We perform both
    intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, and release CWN for the use and scrutiny
    of the community.

  abstract: "Many argumentative texts, and news editorials in particular, follow a\
    \ specific strategy to persuade their readers of some opinion or attitude. This\
    \ includes decisions such as when to tell an anecdote or where to support an assumption\
    \ with statistics, which is reflected by the composition of different types of\
    \ argumentative discourse units in a text. While several argument mining corpora\
    \ have recently been published, they do not allow the study of argumentation strategies\
    \ due to incomplete or coarse-grained unit annotations. This paper presents a\
    \ novel corpus with 300 editorials from three diverse news portals that provides\
    \ the basis for mining argumentation strategies. Each unit in all editorials has\
    \ been assigned one of six types by three annotators with a high Fleiss\u2019\
    \ Kappa agreement of 0.56. We investigate various challenges of the annotation\
    \ process and we conduct a first corpus analysis. Our results reveal different\
    \ strategies across the news portals, exemplifying the benefit of studying editorials\u2014\
    a so far underresourced text genre in argument mining."

  abstract: The Universal Dependencies (UD) project was conceived after the substantial
    recent interest in unifying annotation schemes across languages. With its own
    annotation principles and abstract inventory for parts of speech, morphosyntactic
    features and dependency relations, UD aims to facilitate multilingual parser development,
    cross-lingual learning, and parsing research from a language typology perspective.
    This paper presents the Turkish IMST-UD Treebank, the first Turkish treebank to
    be in a UD release. The IMST-UD Treebank was automatically converted from the
    IMST Treebank, which was also recently released. We describe this conversion procedure
    in detail, complete with mapping tables. We also present our evaluation of the
    parsing performances of both versions of the IMST Treebank. Our findings suggest
    that the UD framework is at least as viable for Turkish as the original annotation
    framework of the IMST Treebank.

  abstract: Arabic dialects present a special problem for natural language processing
    because there are few resources, they have no standard orthography, and have not
    been studied much. However, as more and more written dialectal Arabic is found
    in social media, NLP for Arabic dialects becomes an important goal. We present
    a methodology for creating a morphological analyzer and a morphological tagger
    for dialectal Arabic, and we illustrate it on Egyptian and Levantine Arabic. To
    our knowledge, these are the first analyzer and tagger for Levantine.

  abstract: "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument\
    \ structure in sentences with semantic frame and role labels. For the English\
    \ language, the Proposition Bank provides both a lexicon of all possible semantic\
    \ frames and large amounts of labeled training data. In order to expand SRL beyond\
    \ English, previous work investigated automatic approaches based on parallel corpora\
    \ to automatically generate Proposition Banks for new target languages (TLs).\
    \ However, this approach heuristically produces the frame lexicon from word alignments,\
    \ leading to a range of lexicon-level errors and inconsistencies. To address these\
    \ issues, we propose to manually alias TL verbs to existing English frames. For\
    \ instance, the German verb drehen may evoke several meanings, including \u201C\
    turn something\u201D and \u201Cfilm something\u201D. Accordingly, we alias the\
    \ former to the frame TURN.01 and the latter to a group of frames that includes\
    \ FILM.01 and SHOOT.03. We execute a large-scale manual aliasing effort for three\
    \ target languages and apply the new lexicons to automatically generate large\
    \ Proposition Banks for Chinese, French and German with manually curated frames.\
    \ We present a detailed evaluation in which we find that our proposed approach\
    \ significantly increases the quality and consistency of the generated Proposition\
    \ Banks. We release these resources to the research community."

  abstract: 'Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular architectures
    used in Natural Language Processsing (NLP) tasks because its recurrent structure
    is very suitable to process variable-length text. RNN can utilize distributed
    representations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each text into
    vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: the time-step
    dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing models usually
    utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based operation
    only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector. However, the
    features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually independent, and simply
    applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step dimension independently may destroy
    the structure of the feature representation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional
    (2D) pooling operation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features
    for sequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of the
    matrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain a fixed-length
    representation of the text. This paper also utilizes 2D convolution to sample
    more meaningful information of the matrix. Experiments are conducted on six text
    classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, question classification, subjectivity
    classification and newsgroup classification. Compared with the state-of-the-art
    models, the proposed models achieve excellent performance on 4 out of 6 tasks.
    Specifically, one of the proposed models achieves highest accuracy on Stanford
    Sentiment Treebank binary classification and fine-grained classification tasks.'

  abstract: Current Word Sense Disambiguation systems show an extremely poor performance
    on low frequent senses, which is mainly caused by the difference in sense distributions
    between training and test data. The main focus in tackling this problem has been
    on acquiring more data or selecting a single predominant sense and not necessarily
    on the meta properties of the data itself. We demonstrate that these properties,
    such as the volume, provenance, and balancing, play an important role with respect
    to system performance. In this paper, we describe a set of experiments to analyze
    these meta properties in the framework of a state-of-the-art WSD system when evaluated
    on the SemEval-2013 English all-words dataset. We show that volume and provenance
    are indeed important, but that approximating the perfect balancing of the selected
    training data leads to an improvement of 21 points and exceeds state-of-the-art
    systems by 14 points while using only simple features. We therefore conclude that
    unsupervised acquisition of training data should be guided by strategies aimed
    at matching meta properties.

  abstract: We study the role of the second language in bilingual word embeddings
    in monolingual semantic evaluation tasks. We find strongly and weakly positive
    correlations between down-stream task performance and second language similarity
    to the target language. Additionally, we show how bilingual word embeddings can
    be employed for the task of semantic language classification and that joint semantic
    spaces vary in meaningful ways across second languages. Our results support the
    hypothesis that semantic language similarity is influenced by both structural
    similarity as well as geography/contact.

  abstract: 'Solving word analogies became one of the most popular benchmarks for
    word embeddings on the assumption that linear relations between word pairs (such
    as king:man :: woman:queen) are indicative of the quality of the embedding. We
    question this assumption by showing that the information not detected by linear
    offset may still be recoverable by a more sophisticated search method, and thus
    is actually encoded in the embedding. The general problem with linear offset is
    its sensitivity to the idiosyncrasies of individual words. We show that simple
    averaging over multiple word pairs improves over the state-of-the-art. A further
    improvement in accuracy (up to 30% for some embeddings and relations) is achieved
    by combining cosine similarity with an estimation of the extent to which a candidate
    answer belongs to the correct word class. In addition to this practical contribution,
    this work highlights the problem of the interaction between word embeddings and
    analogy retrieval algorithms, and its implications for the evaluation of word
    embeddings and the use of analogies in extrinsic tasks.'

  abstract: We propose a novel semantic tagging task, semtagging, tailored for the
    purpose of multilingual semantic parsing, and present the first tagger using deep
    residual networks (ResNets). Our tagger uses both word and character representations,
    and includes a novel residual bypass architecture. We evaluate the tagset both
    intrinsically on the new task of semantic tagging, as well as on Part-of-Speech
    (POS) tagging. Our system, consisting of a ResNet and an auxiliary loss function
    predicting our semantic tags, significantly outperforms prior results on English
    Universal Dependencies POS tagging (95.71% accuracy on UD v1.2 and 95.67% accuracy
    on UD v1.3).

  abstract: 'Frame semantics is a theory of linguistic meanings, and is considered
    to be a useful framework for shallow semantic analysis of natural language. FrameNet,
    which is based on frame semantics, is a popular lexical semantic resource. In
    addition to providing a set of core semantic frames and their frame elements,
    FrameNet also provides relations between those frames (hence providing a network
    of frames i.e. FrameNet). We address here the limited coverage of the network
    of conceptual relations between frames in FrameNet, which has previously been
    pointed out by others. We present a supervised model using rich features from
    three different sources: structural features from the existing FrameNet network,
    information from the WordNet relations between synsets projected into semantic
    frames, and corpus-collected lexical associations. We show large improvements
    over baselines consisting of each of the three groups of features in isolation.
    We then use this model to select frame pairs as candidate relations, and perform
    evaluation on a sample with good precision.'

  abstract: We propose a structured generative latent variable model that integrates
    information from multiple contextual representations for Word Sense Induction.
    Our approach jointly models global lexical, local lexical and dependency syntactic
    context. Each context type is associated with a latent variable and the three
    types of variables share a hierarchical structure. We use skip-gram based word
    and dependency context embeddings to construct all three types of representations,
    reducing the total number of parameters to be estimated and enabling better generalization.
    We describe an EM algorithm to efficiently estimate model parameters and use the
    Integrated Complete Likelihood criterion to automatically estimate the number
    of senses. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the SemEval-2010 and
    SemEval-2013 Word Sense Induction datasets.

  abstract: Adaptive machine translation (MT) systems are a promising approach for
    improving the effectiveness of computer-aided translation (CAT) environments.
    There is, however, virtually only theoretical work that examines how such a system
    could be implemented. We present an open source post-editing interface for adaptive
    statistical MT, which has in-depth monitoring capabilities and excellent expandability,
    and can facilitate practical studies. To this end, we designed text-based and
    graphical post-editing interfaces. The graphical interface offers means for displaying
    and editing a rich view of the MT output. Our translation systems may learn from
    post-edits using several weight, language model and novel translation model adaptation
    techniques, in part by exploiting the output of the graphical interface. In a
    user study we show that using the proposed interface and adaptation methods, reductions
    in technical effort and time can be achieved.

  abstract: Simultaneous interpretation allows people to communicate spontaneously
    across language boundaries, but such services are prohibitively expensive for
    the general public. This paper presents a fully automatic simultaneous interpretation
    system to address this problem. Though the development is still at an early stage,
    the system is capable of keeping up with the fastest of the TED speakers while
    at the same time delivering high-quality translations. We believe that the system
    will become an effective tool for facilitating cross-lingual communication in
    the future.

  abstract: The paper introduces a web-based authoring support system, MuTUAL, which
    aims to help writers create multilingual texts. The highlighted feature of the
    system is that it enables machine translation (MT) to generate outputs appropriate
    to their functional context within the target document. Our system is operational
    online, implementing core mechanisms for document structuring and controlled writing.
    These include a topic template and a controlled language authoring assistant,
    linked to our statistical MT system.

  abstract: In this paper and the associated system demo, we present an advanced search
    system that allows to perform a joint search over a (bilingual) valency lexicon
    and a correspondingly annotated linked parallel corpus. This search tool has been
    developed on the basis of the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank, but its
    ideas are applicable in principle to any bilingual parallel corpus that is annotated
    for dependencies and valency (i.e., predicate-argument structure), and where verbs
    are linked to appropriate entries in an associated valency lexicon. Our online
    search tool consolidates more search interfaces into one, providing expanded structured
    search capability and a more efficient advanced way to search, allowing users
    to search for verb pairs, verbal argument pairs, their surface realization as
    recorded in the lexicon, or for their surface form actually appearing in the linked
    parallel corpus. The search system is currently under development, and is replacing
    our current search tool available at http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/CzEngVallex,
    which could search the lexicon but the queries cannot take advantage of the underlying
    corpus nor use the additional surface form information from the lexicon(s). The
    system is available as open source.

  abstract: Much existing work in text-to-scene generation focuses on generating static
    scenes. By introducing a focus on motion verbs, we integrate dynamic semantics
    into a rich formal model of events to generate animations in real time that correlate
    with human conceptions of the event described. This paper presents a working system
    that generates these animated scenes over a test set, discussing challenges encountered
    and describing the solutions implemented.

  abstract: 'More and more disciplines require NLP tools for performing automatic
    text analyses on various levels of linguistic resolution. However, the usage of
    established NLP frameworks is often hampered for several reasons: in most cases,
    they require basic to sophisticated programming skills, interfere with interoperability
    due to using non-standard I/O-formats and often lack tools for visualizing computational
    results. This makes it difficult especially for humanities scholars to use such
    frameworks. In order to cope with these challenges, we present TextImager, a UIMA-based
    framework that offers a range of NLP and visualization tools by means of a user-friendly
    GUI. Using TextImager requires no programming skills.'

  abstract: This paper presents Disco, a prototype for supporting knowledge workers
    in exploring, reviewing and sorting collections of textual data. The goal is to
    facilitate, accelerate and improve the discovery of information. To this end,
    it combines Semantic Relatedness techniques with a review workflow developed in
    a tangible environment. Disco uses a semantic model that is leveraged on-line
    in the course of search sessions, and accessed through natural hand-gesture, in
    a simple and intuitive way.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe Langforia, a multilingual processing pipeline
    to annotate texts with multiple layers: formatting, parts of speech, named entities,
    dependencies, semantic roles, and entity links. Langforia works as a web service,
    where the server hosts the language processing components and the client, the
    input and result visualization. To annotate a text or a Wikipedia page, the user
    chooses an NLP pipeline and enters the text in the interface or selects the page
    URL. Once processed, the results are returned to the client, where the user can
    select the annotation layers s/he wants to visualize. We designed Langforia with
    a specific focus for Wikipedia, although it can process any type of text. Wikipedia
    has become an essential encyclopedic corpus used in many NLP projects. However,
    processing articles and visualizing the annotations are nontrivial tasks that
    require dealing with multiple markup variants, encodings issues, and tool incompatibilities
    across the language versions. This motivated the development of a new architecture.
    A demonstration of Langforia is available for six languages: English, French,
    German, Spanish, Russian, and Swedish at http://vilde.cs.lth.se:9000/ as well
    as a web API: http://vilde.cs.lth.se:9000/api. Langforia is also provided as a
    standalone library and is compatible with cluster computing.'

  abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant increase in the number of large
    scale digital collections of archival documents such as news articles, books,
    etc. Typically, users access these collections through searching or browsing.
    In this paper we investigate another way of accessing temporal collections - across-time
    comparison, i.e., comparing query-relevant information at different periods in
    the past. We propose an interactive framework called HistoryComparator for contrastively
    analyzing concepts in archival document collections at different time periods.

  abstract: In this demo, we present our free on-line multilingual linguistic services
    which allow to analyze sentences or to extract collocations from a corpus directly
    on-line, or by uploading a corpus. They are available for 8 European languages
    (English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish) and can
    also be accessed as web services by programs. While several open systems are available
    for POS-tagging and dependency parsing or terminology extraction, their integration
    into an application requires some computational competence. Furthermore, none
    of the parsers/taggers handles MWEs very satisfactorily, in particular when the
    two terms of the collocation are distant from each other or in reverse order.
    Our tools, on the other hand, are specifically designed for users with no particular
    computational literacy. They do not require from the user any download, installation
    or adaptation if used on-line, and their integration in an application, using
    one the scripts described below is quite easy. Furthermore, by default, the parser
    handles collocations and other MWEs, as well as anaphora resolution (limited to
    3rd person personal pronouns). When used in the tagger mode, it can be set to
    display grammatical functions and collocations.

  abstract: We present a browser-based editor for simplifying English text. Given
    an input sentence, the editor performs both syntactic and lexical simplification.
    It splits a complex sentence into shorter ones, and suggests word substitutions
    in drop-down lists. The user can choose the best substitution from the list, undo
    any inappropriate splitting, and further edit the sentence as necessary. A significant
    novelty is that the system accepts a customized vocabulary list for a target reader
    population. It identifies all words in the text that do not belong to the list,
    and attempts to substitute them with words from the list, thus producing a text
    tailored for the targeted readers.

  abstract: Opinion mining is a natural language processing technique which extracts
    subjective information from natural language text. To estimate an opinion about
    a query in large data collection, an opinion retrieval system that retrieves subjective
    and relevant information about the query can be useful. We present an opinion
    retrieval system that retrieves subjective and query-relevant tweets from Twitter,
    which is a useful source of obtaining real-time opinions. Our system outperforms
    previous opinion retrieval systems, and it further provides subjective information
    about Twitter authors and hashtags to describe their subjective tendencies.

  abstract: In this paper, we discuss our ongoing efforts to construct a scientific
    paper browsing system that helps users to read and understand advanced technical
    content distributed in PDF. Since PDF is a format specifically designed for printing,
    layout and logical structures of documents are indistinguishably embedded in the
    file. It requires much effort to extract natural language text from PDF files,
    and reversely, display semantic annotations produced by NLP tools on the original
    page layout. In our browsing system, we tackle these issues caused by the gap
    between printable document and plain text. Our system provides ways to extract
    natural language sentences from PDF files together with their logical structures,
    and also to map arbitrary textual spans to their corresponding regions on page
    images. We setup a demonstration system using papers published in ACL anthology
    and demonstrate the enhanced search and refined recommendation functions which
    we plan to make widely available to NLP researchers.

  abstract: Instant messaging and push notifications play important roles in modern
    digital life. To enable robust sense-making and rich context awareness in computer
    mediated communications, we introduce EmotionPush, a system that automatically
    conveys the emotion of received text with a colored push notification on mobile
    devices. EmotionPush is powered by state-of-the-art emotion classifiers and is
    deployed for Facebook Messenger clients on Android. The study showed that the
    system is able to help users prioritize interactions.

  abstract: 'We release a cross-lingual wikification system for all languages in Wikipedia.
    Given a piece of text in any supported language, the system identifies names of
    people, locations, organizations, and grounds these names to the corresponding
    English Wikipedia entries. The system is based on two components: a cross-lingual
    named entity recognition (NER) model and a cross-lingual mention grounding model.
    The cross-lingual NER model is a language-independent model which can extract
    named entity mentions in the text of any language in Wikipedia. The extracted
    mentions are then grounded to the English Wikipedia using the cross-lingual mention
    grounding model. The only resources required to train the proposed system are
    the multilingual Wikipedia dump and existing training data for English NER. The
    system is online at http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/demo_view/xl_wikifier'

  abstract: This paper presents a meaning-based statistical math word problem (MWP)
    solver with understanding, reasoning and explanation. It comprises a web user
    interface and pipelined modules for analysing the text, transforming both body
    and question parts into their logic forms, and then performing inference on them.
    The associated context of each quantity is represented with proposed role-tags
    (e.g., nsubj, verb, etc.), which provides the flexibility for annotating the extracted
    math quantity with its associated syntactic and semantic information (which specifies
    the physical meaning of that quantity). Those role-tags are then used to identify
    the desired operands and filter out irrelevant quantities (so that the answer
    can be obtained precisely). Since the physical meaning of each quantity is explicitly
    represented with those role-tags and used in the inference process, the proposed
    approach could explain how the answer is obtained in a human comprehensible way.

  abstract: This paper shows the great potential of incorporating different approaches
    to help writing. Not only did they solve different kinds of writing problems,
    but also they complement and reinforce each other to be a complete and effective
    solution. Despite the extensive and multifaceted feedback and suggestion, writing
    is not all about syntactically or lexically well-written. It involves contents,
    structure, the certain understanding of the background, and many other factors
    to compose a rich, organized and sophisticated text. (e.g., conventional structure
    and idioms in academic writing). There is still a long way to go to accomplish
    the ultimate goal. We envision the future of writing to be a joyful experience
    with the help of instantaneous suggestion and constructive feedback.

  abstract: We present a text simplification approach that is directed at improving
    the performance of state-of-the-art Open Relation Extraction (RE) systems. As
    syntactically complex sentences often pose a challenge for current Open RE approaches,
    we have developed a simplification framework that performs a pre-processing step
    by taking a single sentence as input and using a set of syntactic-based transformation
    rules to create a textual input that is easier to process for subsequently applied
    Open RE systems.

  abstract: FrameNet project has begun from Berkeley in 1997, and is now supported
    in several countries reflecting characteristics of each language. The work for
    generating Korean FrameNet was already done by converting annotated English sentences
    into Korean with trained translators. However, high cost of frame-preservation
    and error revision was a huge burden on further expansion of FrameNet. This study
    makes use of linguistic similarity between Japanese and Korean to increase Korean
    FrameNet corpus with low cost. We also suggest adapting PubAnnotation and Korean-friendly
    valence patterns to FrameNet for increased accessibility.

  abstract: "Any real world events or trends that can affect the company\u2019s growth\
    \ trajectory can be considered as risk. There has been a growing need to automatically\
    \ identify, extract and analyze risk related statements from news events. In this\
    \ demonstration, we will present a risk analytics framework that processes enterprise\
    \ project management reports in the form of textual data and news documents and\
    \ classify them into valid and invalid risk categories. The framework also extracts\
    \ information from the text pertaining to the different categories of risks like\
    \ their possible cause and impacts. Accordingly, we have used machine learning\
    \ based techniques and studied different linguistic features like n-gram, POS,\
    \ dependency, future timing, uncertainty factors in texts and their various combinations.\
    \ A manual annotation study from management experts using risk descriptions collected\
    \ for a specific organization was conducted to evaluate the framework. The evaluation\
    \ showed promising results for automated risk analysis and identification."

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce papago - a translator for mobile device which
    is equipped with new features that can provide convenience for users. The first
    feature is word sense disambiguation based on user feedback. By using the feature,
    users can select one among multiple meanings of a homograph and obtain the corrected
    translation with the user-selected sense. The second feature is the instant currency
    conversion of money expressions contained in a translation result with current
    exchange rate. Users can be quickly and precisely provided the amount of money
    converted as local currency when they travel abroad.

  abstract: We demonstrate TopoText, an interactive tool for digital mapping of literary
    text. TopoText takes as input a literary piece of text such as a novel or a biography
    article and automatically extracts all place names in the text. The identified
    places are then geoparsed and displayed on an interactive map. TopoText calculates
    the number of times a place was mentioned in the text, which is then reflected
    on the map allowing the end-user to grasp the importance of the different places
    within the text. It also displays the most frequent words mentioned within a specified
    proximity of a place name in context or across the entire text. This can also
    be faceted according to part of speech tags. Finally, TopoText keeps the human
    in the loop by allowing the end-user to disambiguate places and to provide specific
    place annotations. All extracted information such as geolocations, place frequencies,
    as well as all user-provided annotations can be automatically exported as a CSV
    file that can be imported later by the same user or other users.

  abstract: We present a system called ACE for Automatic Colloquialism and Errors
    detection for written Chinese. ACE is based on the combination of N-gram model
    and rule-base model. Although it focuses on detecting colloquial Cantonese (a
    dialect of Chinese) at the current stage, it can be extended to detect other dialects.
    We chose Cantonese becauase it has many interesting properties, such as unique
    grammar system and huge colloquial terms, that turn the detection task extremely
    challenging. We conducted experiments using real data and synthetic data. The
    results indicated that ACE is highly reliable and effective.

  abstract: 'We build a tool to assist in content creation by mining the web for information
    relevant to a given topic. This tool imitates the process of essay writing by
    humans: searching for topics on the web, selecting content frag-ments from the
    found document, and then compiling these fragments to obtain a coherent text.
    The process of writing starts with automated building of a table of content by
    obtaining the list of key entities for the given topic extracted from web resources
    such as Wikipedia. Once a table of content is formed, each item forms a seed for
    web mining. The tool builds a full-featured structured Word document with table
    of content, section structure, images and captions and web references for all
    mined text fragments. Two linguistic technologies are employed: for relevance
    verification, we use similarity computed as a tree similarity between parse trees
    for a seed and candidate text fragment. For text coherence, we use a measure of
    agreement between a given and consecutive paragraph by tree kernel learning of
    their discourse trees. The tool is available at http://animatronica.io/submit.html.'

  abstract: This demo presents MAGES (multilingual angle-integrated grouping-based
    entity summarization), an entity summarization system for a large knowledge base
    such as DBpedia based on a entity-group-bound ranking in a single integrated entity
    space across multiple language-specific editions. MAGES offers a multilingual
    angle-integrated space model, which has the advantage of overcoming missing semantic
    tags (i.e., categories) caused by biases in different language communities, and
    can contribute to the creation of entity groups that are well-formed and more
    stable than the monolingual condition within it. MAGES can help people quickly
    identify the essential points of the entities when they search or browse a large
    volume of entity-centric data. Evaluation results on the same experimental data
    demonstrate that our system produces a better summary compared with other representative
    DBpedia entity summarization methods.

  abstract: This paper presents an implementation of the widely used speech analysis
    tool Praat as a web application with an extended functionality for feature annotation.
    In particular, Praat on the Web addresses some of the central limitations of the
    original Praat tool and provides (i) enhanced visualization of annotations in
    a dedicated window for feature annotation at interval and point segments, (ii)
    a dynamic scripting composition exemplified with a modular prosody tagger, and
    (iii) portability and an operational web interface. Speech annotation tools with
    such a functionality are key for exploring large corpora and designing modular
    pipelines.

  abstract: In this paper, we present YAMAMA, a multi-dialect Arabic morphological
    analyzer and disambiguator. Our system is almost five times faster than the state-of-art
    MADAMIRA system with a slightly lower quality. In addition to speed, YAMAMA outputs
    a rich representation which allows for a wider spectrum of use. In this regard,
    YAMAMA transcends other systems, such as FARASA, which is faster but provides
    specific outputs catering to specific applications.

  abstract: In this paper, we present CamelParser, a state-of-the-art system for Arabic
    syntactic dependency analysis aligned with contextually disambiguated morphological
    features. CamelParser uses a state-of-the-art morphological disambiguator and
    improves its results using syntactically driven features. The system offers a
    number of output formats that include basic dependency with morphological features,
    two tree visualization modes, and traditional Arabic grammatical analysis.

  abstract: In this demonstration paper we describe Ambient Search, a system that
    displays and retrieves documents in real time based on speech input. The system
    operates continuously in ambient mode, i.e. it generates speech transcriptions
    and identifies main keywords and keyphrases, while also querying its index to
    display relevant documents without explicit query. Without user intervention,
    the results are dynamically updated; users can choose to interact with the system
    at any time, employing a conversation protocol that is enriched with the ambient
    information gathered continuously. Our evaluation shows that Ambient Search outperforms
    another implicit speech-based information retrieval system. Ambient search is
    available as open source software.

  abstract: ConFarm is a web service dedicated to extraction of surface representations
    of verb and noun constructions from dependency annotated corpora of Russian texts.
    Currently, the extraction of constructions with a specific lemma from SynTagRus
    and Russian National Corpus is available. The system provides flexible interface
    that allows users to fine-tune the output. Extracted constructions are grouped
    by their contents to allow for compact representation, and the groups are visualised
    as a graph in order to help navigating the extraction results. ConFarm differs
    from similar existing tools for Russian language in that it offers full constructions,
    as opposed to extracting separate dependents of search word or working with collocations,
    and allows users to discover unexpected constructions as opposed to searching
    for examples of a user-defined construction.

  abstract: This paper presents a novel high-order dependency parsing framework that
    targets non-projective treebanks. It imitates how a human parses sentences in
    an intuitive way. At every step of the parse, it determines which word is the
    easiest to process among all the remaining words, identifies its head word and
    then folds it under the head word. Further, this work is flexible enough to be
    augmented with other parsing techniques.

  abstract: A script is a type of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence
    (AI). This paper presents two methods for synthetically using collected scripts
    for story generation. The first method recursively generates long sequences of
    events and the second creates script networks. Although related studies generally
    use one or more scripts for story generation, this research synthetically uses
    many scripts to flexibly generate a diverse narrative.

  abstract: Attorneys, judges, and others in the justice system are constantly surrounded
    by large amounts of legal text, which can be difficult to manage across many cases.
    We present CaseSummarizer, a tool for automated text summarization of legal documents
    which uses standard summary methods based on word frequency augmented with additional
    domain-specific knowledge. Summaries are then provided through an informative
    interface with abbreviations, significance heat maps, and other flexible controls.
    It is evaluated using ROUGE and human scoring against several other summarization
    systems, including summary text and feedback provided by domain experts.

  abstract: 'We present PolyglotIE, a web-based tool for developing extractors that
    perform Information Extraction (IE) over multilingual data. Our tool has two core
    features: First, it allows users to develop extractors against a unified abstraction
    that is shared across a large set of natural languages. This means that an extractor
    needs only be created once for one language, but will then run on multilingual
    data without any additional effort or language-specific knowledge on part of the
    user. Second, it embeds this abstraction as a set of views within a declarative
    IE system, allowing users to quickly create extractors using a mature IE query
    language. We present PolyglotIE as a hands-on demo in which users can experiment
    with creating extractors, execute them on multilingual text and inspect extraction
    results. Using the UI, we discuss the challenges and potential of using unified,
    crosslingual semantic abstractions as basis for downstream applications. We demonstrate
    multilingual IE for 9 languages from 4 different language groups: English, German,
    French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Hindi.'

    scatter plots to show the force of a word, i.e., whether the semantics of word
    embeddings from posts of different stances are clearly separated from the aspect
    of this controversial word. In addition, WordForce provides the dispersion and
    the distance of word embeddings from posts of different stance groups, and proposes
    the most controversial words accordingly to show clues to what people argue about
    in a debate.

  abstract: Words to express relations in natural language (NL) statements may be
    different from those to represent properties in knowledge bases (KB). The vocabulary
    gap becomes barriers for knowledge base construction and retrieval. With the demo
    system called NL2KB in this paper, users can browse which properties in KB side
    may be mapped to for a given relational pattern in NL side. Besides, they can
    retrieve the sets of relational patterns in NL side for a given property in KB
    side. We describe how the mapping is established in detail. Although the mined
    patterns are used for Chinese knowledge base applications, the methodology can
    be extended to other languages.

  abstract: "Kotonush, a system that clarifies people\u2019s values on various concepts\
    \ on the basis of what they write about on social media, is presented. The values\
    \ are represented by ordering sets of concepts (e.g., London, Berlin, and Rome)\
    \ in accordance with a common attribute intensity expressed by an adjective (e.g.,\
    \ entertaining). We exploit social media text written by different demographics\
    \ and at different times in order to induce specific orderings for comparison.\
    \ The system combines a text-to-ordering module with an interactive querying interface\
    \ enabled by massive hyponymy relations and provides mechanisms to compare the\
    \ induced orderings from various viewpoints. We empirically evaluate Kotonush\
    \ and present some case studies, featuring real-world concept orderings with different\
    \ domains on Twitter, to demonstrate the usefulness of our system."

  abstract: In this paper, we propose GiveMeExample that ranks example sentences according
    to their capacity of demonstrating the differences among English and Chinese near-synonyms
    for language learners. The difficulty of the example sentences is automatically
    detected. Furthermore, the usage models of the near-synonyms are built by the
    GMM and Bi-LSTM models to suggest the best elaborative sentences. Experiments
    show the good performance both in the fill-in-the-blank test and on the manually
    labeled gold data, that is, the built models can select the appropriate words
    for the given context and vice versa.

  abstract: Compositional distributional models of meaning (CDMs) provide a function
    that produces a vectorial representation for a phrase or a sentence by composing
    the vectors of its words. Being the natural evolution of the traditional and well-studied
    distributional models at the word level, CDMs are steadily evolving to a popular
    and active area of NLP. This COLING 2016 tutorial aims at providing a concise
    introduction to this emerging field, presenting the different classes of CDMs
    and the various issues related to them in sufficient detail.

  abstract: "The rapid accumulation of data in social media (in million and billion\
    \ scales) has imposed great challenges in information extraction, knowledge discovery,\
    \ and data mining, and texts bearing sentiment and opinions are one of the major\
    \ categories of user generated data in social media. Sentiment analysis is the\
    \ main technology to quickly capture what people think from these text data, and\
    \ is a research direction with immediate practical value in \u2018big data\u2019\
    \ era. Learning such techniques will allow data miners to perform advanced mining\
    \ tasks considering real sentiment and opinions expressed by users in additional\
    \ to the statistics calculated from the physical actions (such as viewing or purchasing\
    \ records) user perform, which facilitates the development of real-world applications.\
    \ However, the situation that most tools are limited to the English language might\
    \ stop academic or industrial people from doing research or products which cover\
    \ a wider scope of data, retrieving information from people who speak different\
    \ languages, or developing applications for worldwide users. More specifically,\
    \ sentiment analysis determines the polarities and strength of the sentiment-bearing\
    \ expressions, and it has been an important and attractive research area. In the\
    \ past decade, resources and tools have been developed for sentiment analysis\
    \ in order to provide subsequent vital applications, such as product reviews,\
    \ reputation management, call center robots, automatic public survey, etc. However,\
    \ most of these resources are for the English language. Being the key to the understanding\
    \ of business and government issues, sentiment analysis resources and tools are\
    \ required for other major languages, e.g., Chinese. In this tutorial, audience\
    \ can learn the skills for retrieving sentiment from texts in another major language,\
    \ Chinese, to overcome this obstacle. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce\
    \ the proposed sentiment analysis technologies and datasets in the literature,\
    \ and give the audience the opportunities to use resources and tools to process\
    \ Chinese texts from the very basic preprocessing, i.e., word segmentation and\
    \ part of speech tagging, to sentiment analysis, i.e., applying sentiment dictionaries\
    \ and obtaining sentiment scores, through step-by-step instructions and a hand-on\
    \ practice. The basic processing tools are from CKIP Participants can download\
    \ these resources, use them and solve the problems they encounter in this tutorial.\
    \ This tutorial will begin from some background knowledge of sentiment analysis,\
    \ such as how sentiment are categorized, where to find available corpora and which\
    \ models are commonly applied, especially for the Chinese language. Then a set\
    \ of basic Chinese text processing tools for word segmentation, tagging and parsing\
    \ will be introduced for the preparation of mining sentiment and opinions. After\
    \ bringing the idea of how to pre-process the Chinese language to the audience,\
    \ I will describe our work on compositional Chinese sentiment analysis from words\
    \ to sentences, and an application on social media text (Facebook) as an example.\
    \ All our involved and recently developed related resources, including Chinese\
    \ Morphological Dataset, Augmented NTU Sentiment Dictionary (aug-NTUSD), E-hownet\
    \ with sentiment information, Chinese Opinion Treebank, and the CopeOpi Sentiment\
    \ Scorer, will also be introduced and distributed in this tutorial. The tutorial\
    \ will end by a hands-on session of how to use these materials and tools to process\
    \ Chinese sentiment. Content Details, Materials, and Program please refer to the\

  abstract: During the last decade the amount of scientific information available
    on-line increased at an unprecedented rate. As a consequence, nowadays researchers
    are overwhelmed by an enormous and continuously growing number of articles to
    consider when they perform research activities like the exploration of advances
    in specific topics, peer reviewing, writing and evaluation of proposals. Natural
    Language Processing Technology represents a key enabling factor in providing scientists
    with intelligent patterns to access to scientific information. Extracting information
    from scientific papers, for example, can contribute to the development of rich
    scientific knowledge bases which can be leveraged to support intelligent knowledge
    access and question answering. Summarization techniques can reduce the size of
    long papers to their essential content or automatically generate state-of-the-art-reviews.
    Paraphrase or textual entailment techniques can contribute to the identification
    of relations across different scientific textual sources. This tutorial provides
    an overview of the most relevant tasks related to the processing of scientific
    documents, including but not limited to the in-depth analysis of the structure
    of the scientific articles, their semantic interpretation, content extraction
    and summarization.

  abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) of language output applications is a research
    area that has been attracting significant attention. The goal of QE is to estimate
    the quality of language output applications without the need of human references.
    Instead, machine learning algorithms are used to build supervised models based
    on a few labelled training instances. Such models are able to generalise over
    unseen data and thus QE is a robust method applicable to scenarios where human
    input is not available or possible. One such a scenario where QE is particularly
    appealing is that of Machine Translation, where a score for predicted quality
    can help decide whether or not a translation is useful (e.g. for post-editing)
    or reliable (e.g. for gisting). Other potential applications within Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) include Text Summarisation and Text Simplification. In this tutorial
    we present the task of QE and its application in NLP, focusing on Machine Translation.
    We also introduce QuEst++, a toolkit for QE that encompasses feature extraction
    and machine learning, and propose a practical activity to extend this toolkit
    in various ways.

  abstract: Translated texts, in any language, have unique characteristics that set
    them apart from texts originally written in the same language. Translation Studies
    is a research field that focuses on investigating these characteristics. Until
    recently, research in machine translation (MT) has been entirely divorced from
    translation studies. The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce some of the
    findings of translation studies to researchers interested mainly in machine translation,
    and to demonstrate that awareness to these findings can result in better, more
    accurate MT systems.

  abstract: "Succinct data structures involve the use of novel data structures, compression\
    \ technologies, and other mechanisms to allow data to be stored in extremely small\
    \ memory or disk footprints, while still allowing for efficient access to the\
    \ underlying data. They have successfully been applied in areas such as Information\
    \ Retrieval and Bioinformatics to create highly compressible in-memory search\
    \ indexes which provide efficient search functionality over datasets which traditionally\
    \ could only be processed using external memory data structures. Modern technologies\
    \ in this space are not well known within the NLP community, but have the potential\
    \ to revolutionise NLP, particularly the application to \u2018big data\u2019 in\
    \ the form of terabyte and larger corpora. This tutorial will present a practical\
    \ introduction to the most important succinct data structures, tools, and applications\
    \ with the intent of providing the researchers with a jump-start into this domain.\
    \ The focus of this tutorial will be efficient text processing utilising space\
    \ efficient representations of suffix arrays, suffix trees and searchable integer\
    \ compression schemes with specific applications of succinct data structures to\
    \ common NLP tasks such as n-gram language modelling. -gram language modelling."

  abstract: This tutorial examines the characteristics, advantages and limitations
    of Wikipedia relative to other existing, human-curated resources of knowledge;
    derivative resources, created by converting semi-structured content in Wikipedia
    into structured data; the role of Wikipedia and its derivatives in text analysis;
    and the role of Wikipedia and its derivatives in enhancing information retrieval.
