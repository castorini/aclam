  abstract: We introduce SURel, a novel dataset with human-annotated meaning shifts
    between general-language and domain-specific contexts. We show that meaning shifts
    of term candidates cause errors in term extraction, and demonstrate that the SURel
    annotation reflects these errors. Furthermore, we illustrate that SURel enables
    us to assess optimisations of term extraction techniques when incorporating meaning
    shifts.

  abstract: Usage similarity estimation addresses the semantic proximity of word instances
    in different contexts. We apply contextualized (ELMo and BERT) word and sentence
    embeddings to this task, and propose supervised models that leverage these representations
    for prediction. Our models are further assisted by lexical substitute annotations
    automatically assigned to word instances by context2vec, a neural model that relies
    on a bidirectional LSTM. We perform an extensive comparison of existing word and
    sentence representations on benchmark datasets addressing both graded and binary
    similarity.The best performing models outperform previous methods in both settings.

  abstract: 'Most word embeddings today are trained by optimizing a language modeling
    goal of scoring words in their context, modeled as a multi-class classification
    problem. In this paper, we argue that, despite the successes of this assumption,
    it is incomplete: in addition to its context, orthographical or morphological
    aspects of words can offer clues about their meaning. We define a new modeling
    framework for training word embeddings that captures this intuition. Our framework
    is based on the well-studied problem of multi-label classification and, consequently,
    exposes several design choices for featurizing words and contexts, loss functions
    for training and score normalization. Indeed, standard models such as CBOW and
    fasttext are specific choices along each of these axes. We show via experiments
    that by combining feature engineering with embedding learning, our method can
    outperform CBOW using only 10% of the training data in both the standard word
    embedding evaluations and also text classification experiments.'

  abstract: "Various NLP problems \u2013 such as the prediction of sentence similarity,\
    \ entailment, and discourse relations \u2013 are all instances of the same general\
    \ task: the modeling of semantic relations between a pair of textual elements.\
    \ A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors,\
    \ and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as\
    \ features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has\
    \ been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)\
    \ whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge\
    \ base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction\
    \ between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show\
    \ that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural\
    \ language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational\
    \ problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from\
    \ simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of\
    \ the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction."

  abstract: Multi-relational semantic similarity datasets define the semantic relations
    between two short texts in multiple ways, e.g., similarity, relatedness, and so
    on. Yet, all the systems to date designed to capture such relations target one
    relation at a time. We propose a multi-label transfer learning approach based
    on LSTM to make predictions for several relations simultaneously and aggregate
    the losses to update the parameters. This multi-label regression approach jointly
    learns the information provided by the multiple relations, rather than treating
    them as separate tasks. Not only does this approach outperform the single-task
    approach and the traditional multi-task learning approach, but it also achieves
    state-of-the-art performance on all but one relation of the Human Activity Phrase
    dataset.

  abstract: There is a growing awareness of the need to handle rare and unseen words
    in word representation modelling. In this paper, we focus on few-shot learning
    of emerging concepts that fully exploits only a few available contexts. We introduce
    a substitute-based context representation technique that can be applied on an
    existing word embedding space. Previous context-based approaches to modelling
    unseen words only consider bag-of-word first-order contexts, whereas our method
    aggregates contexts as second-order substitutes that are produced by a sequence-aware
    sentence completion model. We experimented with three tasks that aim to test the
    modelling of emerging concepts. We found that these tasks show different emphasis
    on first and second order contexts, and our substitute-based method achieves superior
    performance on naturally-occurring contexts from corpora.

  abstract: 'Recent studies have shown that pre-trained contextual word embeddings,
    which assign the same word different vectors in different contexts, improve performance
    in many tasks. But while contextual embeddings can also be trained at the character
    level, the effectiveness of such embeddings has not been studied. We derive character-level
    contextual embeddings from Flair (Akbik et al., 2018), and apply them to a time
    normalization task, yielding major performance improvements over the previous
    state-of-the-art: 51% error reduction in news and 33% in clinical notes. We analyze
    the sources of these improvements, and find that pre-trained contextual character
    embeddings are more robust to term variations, infrequent terms, and cross-domain
    changes. We also quantify the size of context that pre-trained contextual character
    embeddings take advantage of, and show that such embeddings capture features like
    part-of-speech and capitalization.'

  abstract: Chatbots (i.e., bots) are becoming widely used in multiple domains, along
    with supporting bot programming platforms. These platforms are equipped with novel
    testing tools aimed at improving the quality of individual chatbots. Doing so
    requires an understanding of what sort of bots are being built (captured by their
    underlying conversation graphs) and how well they perform (derived through analysis
    of conversation logs). In this paper, we propose a new model, Bot2Vec, that embeds
    bots to a compact representation based on their structure and usage logs. Then,
    we utilize Bot2Vec representations to improve the quality of two bot analysis
    tasks. Using conversation data and graphs of over than 90 bots, we show that Bot2Vec
    representations improve detection performance by more than 16% for both tasks.

  abstract: 'Word embeddings have recently been shown to reflect many of the pronounced
    societal biases (e.g., gender bias or racial bias). Existing studies are, however,
    limited in scope and do not investigate the consistency of biases across relevant
    dimensions like embedding models, types of texts, and different languages. In
    this work, we present a systematic study of biases encoded in distributional word
    vector spaces: we analyze how consistent the bias effects are across languages,
    corpora, and embedding models. Furthermore, we analyze the cross-lingual biases
    encoded in bilingual embedding spaces, indicative of the effects of bias transfer
    encompassed in cross-lingual transfer of NLP models. Our study yields some unexpected
    findings, e.g., that biases can be emphasized or downplayed by different embedding
    models or that user-generated content may be less biased than encyclopedic text.
    We hope our work catalyzes bias research in NLP and informs the development of
    bias reduction techniques.'

  abstract: 'We introduce a novel topic modeling approach based on constructing a
    semantic set cover for clusters of similar documents. Specifically, our approach
    first clusters documents using their Tf-Idf representation, and then covers each
    cluster with a set of topic words based on semantic similarity, defined in terms
    of a word embedding. Computing a topic cover amounts to solving a minimum set
    cover problem. Our evaluation compares our topic modeling approach to Latent Dirichlet
    Allocation (LDA) on three metrics: 1) qualitative topic match, measured using
    evaluations by Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers, 2) performance on classification
    tasks using each topic model as a sparse feature representation, and 3) topic
    coherence. We find that qualitative judgments significantly favor our approach,
    the method outperforms LDA on topic coherence, and is comparable to LDA on document
    classification tasks.'

  abstract: We introduce MCScript2.0, a machine comprehension corpus for the end-to-end
    evaluation of script knowledge. MCScript2.0 contains approx. 20,000 questions
    on approx. 3,500 texts, crowdsourced based on a new collection process that results
    in challenging questions. Half of the questions cannot be answered from the reading
    texts, but require the use of commonsense and, in particular, script knowledge.
    We give a thorough analysis of our corpus and show that while the task is not
    challenging to humans, existing machine comprehension models fail to perform well
    on the data, even if they make use of a commonsense knowledge base. The dataset
    is available at http://www.sfb1102. uni-saarland.de/?page_id=2582

  abstract: Multimodal semantic models that extend linguistic representations with
    additional perceptual input have proved successful in a range of natural language
    processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research has successfully used neural methods to
    automatically create visual representations for words. However, these works have
    extracted visual features from complete images, and have not examined how different
    kinds of visual information impact performance. In contrast, we construct multimodal
    models that differentiate between internal visual properties of the objects and
    their external visual context. We evaluate the models on the task of decoding
    brain activity associated with the meanings of nouns, demonstrating their advantage
    over those based on complete images.

  abstract: We present path2vec, a new approach for learning graph embeddings that
    relies on structural measures of pairwise node similarities. The model learns
    representations for nodes in a dense space that approximate a given user-defined
    graph distance measure, such as e.g. the shortest path distance or distance measures
    that take information beyond the graph structure into account. Evaluation of the
    proposed model on semantic similarity and word sense disambiguation tasks, using
    various WordNet-based similarity measures, show that our approach yields competitive
    results, outperforming strong graph embedding baselines. The model is computationally
    efficient, being orders of magnitude faster than the direct computation of graph-based
    distances.

  abstract: 'Language use varies across different demographic factors, such as gender,
    age, and geographic location. However, most existing document classification methods
    ignore demographic variability. In this study, we examine empirically how text
    data can vary across four demographic factors: gender, age, country, and region.
    We propose a multitask neural model to account for demographic variations via
    adversarial training. In experiments on four English-language social media datasets,
    we find that classification performance improves when adapting for user factors.'

  abstract: Negation often conveys implicit positive meaning. In this paper, we present
    a corpus of negations and their underlying positive interpretations. We work with
    negations from Simple Wikipedia, automatically generate potential positive interpretations,
    and then collect manual annotations that effectively rewrite the negation in positive
    terms. This procedure yields positive interpretations for approximately 77% of
    negations, and the final corpus includes over 5,700 negations and over 5,900 positive
    interpretations. We also present baseline results using seq2seq neural models.

  abstract: To model conditionals in a way that reflects their acceptability, we must
    include some means of making judgements about whether antecedent and consequent
    are meaningfully related or not. Enthymemes are non-logical arguments which do
    not hold up by themselves, but are acceptable through their relation to a topos,
    an already-known general principle or pattern for reasoning. This paper uses enthymemes
    and topoi as a way to model the world-knowledge behind these judgements. In doing
    so, it provides a reformalisation (in TTR) of enthymemes and topoi as networks
    rather than functions, and information state update rules for conditionals.

  abstract: Temporal Dependency Trees are a structured temporal representation that
    represents temporal relations among time expressions and events in a text as a
    dependency tree structure. Compared to traditional pair-wise temporal relation
    representations, temporal dependency trees facilitate efficient annotations, higher
    inter-annotator agreement, and efficient computations. However, annotations on
    temporal dependency trees so far have only been done by expert annotators, which
    is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a method to crowdsource
    temporal dependency tree annotations, and show that this representation is intuitive
    and can be collected with high accuracy and agreement through crowdsourcing. We
    produce a corpus of temporal dependency trees, and present a baseline temporal
    dependency parser, trained and evaluated on this new corpus.

  abstract: Noise is inherent in real world datasets and modeling noise is critical
    during training as it is effective in regularization. Recently, novel semi-supervised
    deep learning techniques have demonstrated tremendous potential when learning
    with very limited labeled training data in image processing tasks. A critical
    aspect of these semi-supervised learning techniques is augmenting the input or
    the network with noise to be able to learn robust models. While modeling noise
    is relatively straightforward in continuous domains such as image classification,
    it is not immediately apparent how noise can be modeled in discrete domains such
    as language. Our work aims to address this gap by exploring different noise strategies
    for the semi-supervised named entity classification task, including statistical
    methods such as adding Gaussian noise to input embeddings, and linguistically-inspired
    ones such as dropping words and replacing words with their synonyms. We compare
    their performance on two benchmark datasets (OntoNotes and CoNLL) for named entity
    classification. Our results indicate that noise strategies that are linguistically
    informed perform at least as well as statistical approaches, while being simpler
    and requiring minimal tuning.

  abstract: In order for coreference resolution systems to be useful in practice,
    they must be able to generalize to new text. In this work, we demonstrate that
    the performance of the state-of-the-art system decreases when the names of PER
    and GPE named entities in the CoNLL dataset are changed to names that do not occur
    in the training set. We use the technique of adversarial gradient-based training
    to retrain the state-of-the-art system and demonstrate that the retrained system
    achieves higher performance on the CoNLL dataset (both with and without the change
    of named entities) and the GAP dataset.

  abstract: "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) represents sentences as directed,\
    \ acyclic and rooted graphs, aiming at capturing their meaning in a machine readable\
    \ format. AMR parsing converts natural language sentences into such graphs. However,\
    \ evaluating a parser on new data by means of comparison to manually created AMR\
    \ graphs is very costly. Also, we would like to be able to detect parses of questionable\
    \ quality, or preferring results of alternative systems by selecting the ones\
    \ for which we can assess good quality. We propose AMR accuracy prediction as\
    \ the task of predicting several metrics of correctness for an automatically generated\
    \ AMR parse \u2013 in absence of the corresponding gold parse. We develop a neural\
    \ end-to-end multi-output regression model and perform three case studies: firstly,\
    \ we evaluate the model\u2019s capacity of predicting AMR parse accuracies and\
    \ test whether it can reliably assign high scores to gold parses. Secondly, we\
    \ perform parse selection based on predicted parse accuracies of candidate parses\
    \ from alternative systems, with the aim of improving overall results. Finally,\
    \ we predict system ranks for submissions from two AMR shared tasks on the basis\
    \ of their predicted parse accuracy averages. All experiments are carried out\
    \ across two different domains and show that our method is effective."

  abstract: "We introduce a set of nine challenge tasks that test for the understanding\
    \ of function words. These tasks are created by structurally mutating sentences\
    \ from existing datasets to target the comprehension of specific types of function\
    \ words (e.g., prepositions, wh-words). Using these probing tasks, we explore\
    \ the effects of various pretraining objectives for sentence encoders (e.g., language\
    \ modeling, CCG supertagging and natural language inference (NLI)) on the learned\
    \ representations. Our results show that pretraining on CCG\u2014our most syntactic\
    \ objective\u2014performs the best on average across our probing tasks, suggesting\
    \ that syntactic knowledge helps function word comprehension. Language modeling\
    \ also shows strong performance, supporting its widespread use for pretraining\
    \ state-of-the-art NLP models. Overall, no pretraining objective dominates across\
    \ the board, and our function word probing tasks highlight several intuitive differences\
    \ between pretraining objectives, e.g., that NLI helps the comprehension of negation."

  - explanation: We found some mismappings of labels in some of the datasets we used
      in the paper, which affected some of the results reported. It does not significantly
      affect any of the bottom line conclusions of the work, but the difference is
      enough that we would like to submit a correction. I.e. our main takeaways from
      the paper were that no pretraining objective uniformly dominated across the
      datasets (still true) and that pretraining can sometimes hurt performance (still
      true). But some intermediate conclusions did change, e.g. rather than CCG being
      the best on average, we now see LM as the best on average (or rather LM and
      CCG perform statistically equivalently).

  abstract: Large crowdsourced datasets are widely used for training and evaluating
    neural models on natural language inference (NLI). Despite these efforts, neural
    models have a hard time capturing logical inferences, including those licensed
    by phrase replacements, so-called monotonicity reasoning. Since no large dataset
    has been developed for monotonicity reasoning, it is still unclear whether the
    main obstacle is the size of datasets or the model architectures themselves. To
    investigate this issue, we introduce a new dataset, called HELP, for handling
    entailments with lexical and logical phenomena. We add it to training data for
    the state-of-the-art neural models and evaluate them on test sets for monotonicity
    phenomena. The results showed that our data augmentation improved the overall
    accuracy. We also find that the improvement is better on monotonicity inferences
    with lexical replacements than on downward inferences with disjunction and modification.
    This suggests that some types of inferences can be improved by our data augmentation
    while others are immune to it.

  abstract: Popular Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets have been shown to be
    tainted by hypothesis-only biases. Adversarial learning may help models ignore
    sensitive biases and spurious correlations in data. We evaluate whether adversarial
    learning can be used in NLI to encourage models to learn representations free
    of hypothesis-only biases. Our analyses indicate that the representations learned
    via adversarial learning may be less biased, with only small drops in NLI accuracy.

  abstract: "We present BIS, a Bayesian Inference Semantics, for probabilistic reasoning\
    \ in natural language. The current system is based on the framework of Bernardy\
    \ et al. (2018), but departs from it in important respects. BIS makes use of Bayesian\
    \ learning for inferring a hypothesis from premises. This involves estimating\
    \ the probability of the hypothesis, given the data supplied by the premises of\
    \ an argument. It uses a syntactic parser to generate typed syntactic structures\
    \ that serve as input to a model generation system. Sentences are interpreted\
    \ compositionally to probabilistic programs, and the corresponding truth values\
    \ are estimated using sampling methods. BIS successfully deals with various probabilistic\
    \ semantic phenomena, including frequency adverbs, generalised quantifiers, generics,\
    \ and vague predicates. It performs well on a number of interesting probabilistic\
    \ reasoning tasks. It also sustains most classically valid inferences (instantiation,\
    \ de Morgan\u2019s laws, etc.). To test BIS we have built an experimental test\
    \ suite with examples of a range of probabilistic and classical inference patterns."

  abstract: Incivility in public discourse has been a major concern in recent times
    as it can affect the quality and tenacity of the discourse negatively. In this
    paper, we present neural models that can learn to detect name-calling and vulgarity
    from a newspaper comment section. We show that in contrast to prior work on detecting
    toxic language, fine-grained incivilities like namecalling cannot be accurately
    detected by simple models like logistic regression. We apply the models trained
    on the newspaper comments data to detect uncivil comments in a Russian troll dataset,
    and find that despite the change of domain, the model makes accurate predictions.

  abstract: "Automatically generating animation from natural language text finds application\
    \ in a number of areas e.g. movie script writing, instructional videos, and public\
    \ safety. However, translating natural language text into animation is a challenging\
    \ task. Existing text-to-animation systems can handle only very simple sentences,\
    \ which limits their applications. In this paper, we develop a text-to-animation\
    \ system which is capable of handling complex sentences. We achieve this by introducing\
    \ a text simplification step into the process. Building on an existing animation\
    \ generation system for screenwriting, we create a robust NLP pipeline to extract\
    \ information from screenplays and map them to the system\u2019s knowledge base.\
    \ We develop a set of linguistic transformation rules that simplify complex sentences.\
    \ Information extracted from the simplified sentences is used to generate a rough\
    \ storyboard and video depicting the text. Our sentence simplification module\
    \ outperforms existing systems in terms of BLEU and SARI metrics.We further evaluated\
    \ our system via a user study: 68% participants believe that our system generates\
    \ reasonable animation from input screenplays."

  abstract: "We present the SemEval 2019 shared task on Universal Conceptual Cognitive\
    \ Annotation (UCCA) parsing in English, German and French, and discuss the participating\
    \ systems and results. UCCA is a cross-linguistically applicable framework for\
    \ semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological work and supports\
    \ rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as\
    \ it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures\
    \ and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units. The shared task\
    \ has yielded improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline in all languages\
    \ and settings. Full results can be found in the task\u2019s website https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19160."

  abstract: This paper describes a simple UCCA semantic graph parsing approach. The
    key idea is to convert a UCCA semantic graph into a constituent tree, in which
    extra labels are deliberately designed to mark remote edges and discontinuous
    nodes for future recovery. In this way, we can make use of existing syntactic
    parsing techniques. Based on the data statistics, we recover discontinuous nodes
    directly according to the output labels of the constituent parser and use a biaffine
    classification model to recover the more complex remote edges. The classification
    model and the constituent parser are simultaneously trained under the multi-task
    learning framework. We use the multilingual BERT as extra features in the open
    tracks. Our system ranks the first place in the six English/German closed/open
    tracks among seven participating systems. For the seventh cross-lingual track,
    where there is little training data for French, we propose a language embedding
    approach to utilize English and German training data, and our result ranks the
    second place.

  abstract: "This paper presents Unsupervised Lexical Frame Induction, Task 2 of the\
    \ International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation in 2019. Given a set of prespecified\
    \ syntactic forms in context, the task requires that verbs and their arguments\
    \ be clustered to resemble semantic frame structures. Results are useful in identifying\
    \ polysemous words, i.e., those whose frame structures are not easily distinguished,\
    \ as well as discerning semantic relations of the arguments. Evaluation of unsupervised\
    \ frame induction methods fell into two tracks: Task A) Verb Clustering based\
    \ on FrameNet 1.7; and B) Argument Clustering, with B.1) based on FrameNet\u2019\
    s core frame elements, and B.2) on VerbNet 3.2 semantic roles. The shared task\
    \ attracted nine teams, of whom three reported promising results. This paper describes\
    \ the task and its data, reports on methods and resources that these systems used,\
    \ and offers a comparison to human annotation."

  abstract: 'We describe our solutions for semantic frame and role induction subtasks
    of SemEval 2019 Task 2. Our approaches got the highest scores, and the solution
    for the frame induction problem officially took the first place. The main contributions
    of this paper are related to the semantic frame induction problem. We propose
    a combined approach that employs two different types of vector representations:
    dense representations from hidden layers of a masked language model, and sparse
    representations based on substitutes for the target word in the context. The first
    one better groups synonyms, the second one is better at disambiguating homonyms.
    Extending the context to include nearby sentences improves the results in both
    cases. New Hearst-like patterns for verbs are introduced that prove to be effective
    for frame induction. Finally, we propose an approach to selecting the number of
    clusters in agglomerative clustering.'

  abstract: "In this paper, we present the SemEval-2019 Task 3 - EmoContext: Contextual\
    \ Emotion Detection in Text. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations\
    \ make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. For instance, as humans,\
    \ on reading \u201CWhy don\u2019t you ever text me!\u201D we can either interpret\
    \ it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines. However,\
    \ the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this\
    \ task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns\
    \ of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by\
    \ choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate\
    \ the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with\
    \ a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several\
    \ data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation\
    \ data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively\
    \ were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to\
    \ this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest\
    \ ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score. Our analysis of systems\
    \ submitted to the task indicate that Bi-directional LSTM was the most common\
    \ choice of neural architecture used, and most of the systems had the best performance\
    \ for the Sad emotion class, and the worst for the Happy emotion class."

    the detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Spanish and English
    messages extracted from Twitter. The task is organized in two related classification
    subtasks: a main binary subtask for detecting the presence of hate speech, and
    a finer-grained one devoted to identifying further features in hateful contents
    such as the aggressive attitude and the target harassed, to distinguish if the
    incitement is against an individual rather than a group. HatEval has been one
    of the most popular tasks in SemEval-2019 with a total of 108 submitted runs for
    Subtask A and 70 runs for Subtask B, from a total of 74 different teams. Data
    provided for the task are described by showing how they have been collected and

  abstract: In this article, we describe our participation in HatEval, a shared task
    aimed at the detection of hate speech against immigrants and women. We focused
    on Spanish subtasks, building from our previous experiences on sentiment analysis
    in this language. We trained linear classifiers and Recurrent Neural Networks,
    using classic features, such as bag-of-words, bag-of-characters, and word embeddings,
    and also with recent techniques such as contextualized word representations. In
    particular, we trained robust task-oriented subword-aware embeddings and computed
    tweet representations using a weighted-averaging strategy. In the final evaluation,
    our systems showed competitive results for both Spanish subtasks ES-A and ES-B,
    achieving the first and fourth places respectively.

    \ We participated in the subtask A for English and ranked first in the evaluation\
    \ on the test set. We evaluate the quality of multiple sentence embeddings and\
    \ explore multiple training models to evaluate the performance of simple yet effective\
    \ embedding-ML combination algorithms. Our team - Fermi\u2019s model achieved\
    \ an accuracy of 65.00% for English language in task A. Our models, which use\
    \ pretrained Universal Encoder sentence embeddings for transforming the input\
    \ and SVM (with RBF kernel) for classification, scored first position (among 68)\
    \ in the leaderboard on the test set for Subtask A in English language. In this\

  abstract: We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2019 Task 6 on
    Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval).
    The task was based on a new dataset, the Offensive Language Identification Dataset
    (OLID), which contains over 14,000 English tweets, and it featured three sub-tasks.
    In sub-task A, systems were asked to discriminate between offensive and non-offensive
    posts. In sub-task B, systems had to identify the type of offensive content in
    the post. Finally, in sub-task C, systems had to detect the target of the offensive
    posts. OffensEval attracted a large number of participants and it was one of the
    most popular tasks in SemEval-2019. In total, nearly 800 teams signed up to participate
    in the task and 115 of them submitted results, which are presented and analyzed
    in this report.

  abstract: Transfer learning and domain adaptive learning have been applied to various
    fields including computer vision (e.g., image recognition) and natural language
    processing (e.g., text classification). One of the benefits of transfer learning
    is to learn effectively and efficiently from limited labeled data with a pre-trained
    model. In the shared task of identifying and categorizing offensive language in
    social media, we preprocess the dataset according to the language behaviors on
    social media, and then adapt and fine-tune the Bidirectional Encoder Representation
    from Transformer (BERT) pre-trained by Google AI Language team. Our team NULI
    wins the first place (1st) in Sub-task A - Offensive Language Identification and
    is ranked 4th and 18th in Sub-task B - Automatic Categorization of Offense Types
    and Sub-task C - Offense Target Identification respectively.

    is the corresponding full UCCA xml. Based on the idea of graph illustration and
    transformation, we perform four main tasks when building GT System. At the first
    task, we illustrate the graph form of stanford dependencies2 of input text. We
    then transform into an intermediate graph in the second task. At the third task,
    we continue to transform into ouput graph form. Finally, we create the output
    UCCA xml. The evaluation results show that our method generates good-quality UCCA
    xml and has a meaningful contribution to the semantic represetation sub-field
    in Natural Language Processing.'

    perform semantic parsing using a sequence tagger to estimate the probabilities
    of the UCCA categories in the sentence. Then, we apply a decoding policy which
    interprets these probabilities and builds the graph nodes. Parsing is done recursively,
    we perform a first inference on the sentence to extract the main scenes and links
    and then we recursively apply our model on the sentence using a masking features
    that reflects the decisions made in previous steps. Process continues until the
    terminal nodes are reached. We chose a standard neural tagger and we focus on
    our recursive parsing strategy and on the cross lingual transfer problem to develop
    a robust model for the French language, using only few training samples'

  abstract: 'Building large datasets annotated with semantic information, such as
    FrameNet, is an expensive process. Consequently, such resources are unavailable
    for many languages and specific domains. This problem can be alleviated by using
    unsupervised approaches to induce the frames evoked by a collection of documents.
    That is the objective of the second task of SemEval 2019, which comprises three
    subtasks: clustering of verbs that evoke the same frame and clustering of arguments
    into both frame-specific slots and semantic roles. We approach all the subtasks
    by applying a graph clustering algorithm on contextualized embedding representations
    of the verbs and arguments. Using such representations is appropriate in the context
    of this task, since they provide cues for word-sense disambiguation. Thus, they
    can be used to identify different frames evoked by the same words. Using this
    approach we were able to outperform all of the baselines reported for the task
    on the test set in terms of Purity F1, as well as in terms of BCubed F1 in most
    cases.'

  abstract: The paper describes an ensemble of linear perceptrons trained for emotion
    classification as part of the SemEval-2019 shared-task 3. The model uses a matrix
    of probabilities to weight the activations of the base-classifiers and makes a
    final prediction using the sum rule. The base-classifiers are multi-class perceptrons
    utilizing character and word n-grams, part-of-speech tags and sentiment polarity
    scores. The results of our experiments indicate that the ensemble outperforms
    the base-classifiers, but only marginally. In the best scenario our model attains
    an F-Micro score of 0.672, whereas the base-classifiers attained scores ranging
    from 0.636 to 0.666.

  abstract: Detecting emotion from dialogue is a challenge that has not yet been extensively
    surveyed. One could consider the emotion of each dialogue turn to be independent,
    but in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical approach to classify emotion, hypothesizing
    that the current emotional state depends on previous latent emotions. We benchmark
    several feature-based classifiers using pre-trained word and emotion embeddings,
    state-of-the-art end-to-end neural network models, and Gaussian processes for
    automatic hyper-parameter search. In our experiments, hierarchical architectures
    consistently give significant improvements, and our best model achieves a 76.77%
    F1-score on the test set.

    which were extracted by a SAS program. The usefulness of the different feature
    types was evaluated by means of Monte-Carlo resampling tests. As this system does
    not rest on any deep learning component, which is currently considered as the

    such kind of systems.'

  abstract: This paper describes our system at SemEval 2019, Task 3 (EmoContext),
    which focused on the contextual detection of emotions in a dataset of 3-round
    dialogues. For our final system, we used a neural network with pretrained ELMo
    word embeddings and POS tags as input, GRUs as hidden units, an attention mechanism
    to capture representations of the dialogues, and an SVM classifier which used
    the learned network representations to perform the task of multi-class classification.This
    system yielded a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.7072 for the three emotion classes,
    improving the baseline by approximately 12%.

  abstract: With text lacking valuable information avail-able in other modalities,
    context may provide useful information to better detect emotions. In this paper,
    we do a systematic exploration of the role of context in recognizing emotion in
    a conversation. We use a Naive Bayes model to show that inferring the mood of
    the conversation before classifying individual utterances leads to better performance.
    Additionally, we find that using context while train-ing the model significantly
    decreases performance. Our approach has the additional bene-fit that its performance
    rivals a baseline LSTM model while requiring fewer resources.

  abstract: This work describes the system presented by the CoAStaL Natural Language
    Processing group at University of Copenhagen. The main system we present uses
    the same attention mechanism presented in (Yang et al., 2016). Our overall model
    architecture is also inspired by their hierarchical classification model and adapted
    to deal with classification in dialogue by encoding information at the turn level.
    We use different encodings for each turn to create a more expressive representation
    of dialogue context which is then fed into our classifier.We also define a custom
    preprocessing step in order to deal with language commonly used in interactions
    across many social media outlets. Our proposed system achieves a micro F1 score
    of 0.7340 on the test set and shows significant gains in performance compared
    to a system using dialogue level encoding.

  abstract: In this paper, I describe a fusion model combining contextualized and
    static word representations for approaching the EmoContext task in the SemEval
    2019 competition. The model is based on two Recurrent Neural Networks, the first
    one is fed with a state-of-the-art ELMo deep contextualized word representation
    and the second one is fed with a static Word2Vec embedding augmented with 10-dimensional
    affective word feature vector. The proposed model is compared with two baseline
    models based on a static word representation and a contextualized word representation,
    separately. My approach achieved officially 0.7278 microaveraged F1 score on the
    test dataset, ranking 47th out of 165 participants.

  abstract: This paper describes our proposed system & experiments performed to detect
    contextual emotion in texts for SemEval 2019 Task 3. We exploit sentiment information,
    syntactic patterns & semantic relatedness to capture diverse aspects of the text.
    Word level embeddings such as Glove, FastText, Emoji along with sentence level
    embeddings like Skip-Thought, DeepMoji & Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron were used
    as input features to our architecture. We democratize the learning using ensembling
    of models with different parameters to produce the final output. This paper discusses
    comparative analysis of the significance of these embeddings and our approach
    for the task.

  abstract: Task 3, EmoContext, in the International Workshop SemEval 2019 provides
    training and testing datasets for the participant teams to detect emotion classes
    (Happy, Sad, Angry, or Others). This paper proposes a participating system (EmoDet)
    to detect emotions using deep learning architecture. The main input to the system
    is a combination of Word2Vec word embeddings and a set of semantic features (e.g.
    from AffectiveTweets Weka-package). The proposed system (EmoDet) ensembles a fully
    connected neural network architecture and LSTM neural network to obtain performance
    results that show substantial improvements (F1-Score 0.67) over the baseline model
    provided by Task 3 organizers (F1-score 0.58).

    emotion detection as part of SemEval-2019 Task 3. We experiment with transfer
    learning using pre-trained language models (ULMFiT, OpenAI GPT, and BERT) and
    fine-tune them on this task. We also train a deep learning model from scratch
    using pre-trained word embeddings and BiLSTM architecture with attention mechanism.
    The ensembled model achieves competitive result, ranking ninth out of 165 teams.
    The result reveals that ULMFiT performs best due to its superior fine-tuning techniques.
    We propose improvements for future work.

  abstract: Recent advancements in Internet and Mobile infrastructure have resulted
    in the development of faster and efficient platforms of communication. These platforms
    include speech, facial and text-based conversational mediums. Majority of these
    are text-based messaging platforms. Development of Chatbots that automatically
    understand latent emotions in the textual message is a challenging task. In this
    paper, we present an automatic emotion detection system that aims to detect the
    emotion of a person textually conversing with a chatbot. We explore deep learning
    techniques such as CNN and LSTM based neural networks and outperformed the baseline
    score by 14%. The trained model and code are kept in public domain.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our approach to solve Semeval task 3: EmoContext;
    where, given a textual dialogue i.e. a user utterance along with two turns of
    context, we have to classify the emotion associated with the utterance as one
    of the following emotion classes: Happy, Sad, Angry or Others. To solve this problem,
    we experiment with different deep learning models ranging from simple bidirectional
    LSTM (Long and short term memory) model to comparatively complex attention model.
    We also experiment with word embedding conceptnet along with word embedding generated
    from bi-directional LSTM taking input characters. We fine-tune different parameters
    and hyper-parameters associated with each of our models and report the value of
    evaluating measure i.e. micro precision along with class wise precision, recall
    and F1-score of each system. We report the bidirectional LSTM model, along with
    the input word embedding as the concatenation of word embedding generated from
    bidirectional LSTM for word characters and conceptnet embedding, as the best performing
    model with a highest micro-F1 score of 0.7261. We also report class wise precision,
    recall, and f1-score of best performing model along with other models that we
    have experimented with.'

  abstract: We proposed a model to address emotion recognition in textual conversation
    based on using automatically extracted features and human engineered features.
    The proposed model utilizes a fast gated-recurrent-unit backed by CuDNN, and a
    convolutional neural network to automatically extract features. The human engineered
    features take the frequency-inverse document frequency of semantic meaning and
    mood tags extracted from SinticNet.

  abstract: This paper addresses the problem of modeling textual conversations and
    detecting emotions. Our proposed model makes use of 1) deep transfer learning
    rather than the classical shallow methods of word embedding; 2) self-attention
    mechanisms to focus on the most important parts of the texts and 3) turn-based
    conversational modeling for classifying the emotions. The approach does not rely
    on any hand-crafted features or lexicons. Our model was evaluated on the data
    provided by the SemEval-2019 shared task on contextual emotion detection in text.
    The model shows very competitive results.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our system for SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext,
    which aims to predict the emotion of the third utterance considering two preceding
    utterances in a dialogue. To address this challenge of predicting the emotion
    considering its context, we propose a Multi-View Turn-by-Turn (MVTT) model. Firstly,
    MVTT model generates vectors from each utterance using two encoders: word-level
    Bi-GRU encoder (WLE) and character-level CNN encoder (CLE). Then, MVTT grasps
    contextual information by combining the vectors and predict the emotion with the
    contextual information. We conduct experiments on the effect of vector encoding
    and vector combination. Our final MVTT model achieved 0.7634 microaveraged F1
    score.'

  abstract: "When reading \u201CI don\u2019t want to talk to you any more\u201D, we\
    \ might interpret this as either an angry or a sad emotion in the absence of context.\
    \ Often, the utterances are shorter, and given a short utterance like \u201CMe\
    \ too!\u201D, it is difficult to interpret the emotion without context. The lack\
    \ of prosodic or visual information makes it a challenging problem to detect such\
    \ emotions only with text. However, using contextual information in the dialogue\
    \ is gaining importance to provide a context-aware recognition of linguistic features\
    \ such as emotion, dialogue act, sentiment etc. The SemEval 2019 Task 3 EmoContext\
    \ competition provides a dataset of three-turn dialogues labeled with the three\
    \ emotion classes, i.e. Happy, Sad and Angry, and in addition with Others as none\
    \ of the aforementioned emotion classes. We develop an ensemble of the recurrent\
    \ neural model with character- and word-level features as an input to solve this\
    \ problem. The system performs quite well, achieving a microaveraged F1 score\
    \ (F1\u03BC) of 0.7212 for the three emotion classes."

  abstract: Sentiment analysis (SA) in texts is a well-studied Natural Language Processing
    task, which in nowadays gains popularity due to the explosion of social media,
    and the subsequent accumulation of huge amounts of related data. However, capturing
    emotional states and the sentiment polarity of written excerpts requires knowledge
    on the events triggering them. Towards this goal, we present a computational end-to-end
    context-aware SA methodology, which was competed in the context of the SemEval-2019
    / EmoContext task (Task 3). The proposed system is founded on the combination
    of two neural architectures, a deep recurrent neural network, structured by an
    attentive Bidirectional LSTM, and a deep dense network (DNN). The system achieved
    0.745 micro f1-score, and ranked 26/165 (top 20%) teams among the official task
    submissions.

    textual conversations in SemEval-2019. Our model extends the Recurrent Convolutional
    Neural Network (RCNN) by using external fine-tuned word representations and DeepMoji
    sentence representations. We also explored several other competitive pre-trained
    word and sentence representations including ELMo, BERT and InferSent but found
    inferior performance. In addition, we conducted extensive sensitivity analysis,
    which empirically shows that our model is relatively robust to hyper-parameters.
    Our model requires no handcrafted features or emotion lexicons but achieved good
    performance with a micro-F1 score of 0.7463.

  abstract: "In this paper we present our submission for SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext.\
    \ The task consisted of classifying a textual dialogue into one of four emotion\
    \ classes: happy, sad, angry or others. Our approach tried to improve on multiple\
    \ aspects, preprocessing with an emphasis on spell-checking and ensembling with\
    \ four different models: Bi-directional contextual LSTM (BC-LSTM), categorical\
    \ Bi-LSTM (CAT-LSTM), binary convolutional Bi-LSTM (BIN-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent\
    \ Unit (GRU). On the leader-board, we submitted two systems that obtained a micro\
    \ F1 score (F1\u03BC) of 0.711 and 0.712. After the competition, we merged our\
    \ two systems with ensembling, which achieved a F1\u03BC of 0.7324 on the test\
    \ dataset."

    absence of nonverbal cues typically associated with emotion, like fa- cial expression
    or voice modulations. How- ever, more and more users are using message platforms
    such as WhatsApp or Telegram. For this reason, it is important to develop systems
    capable of understanding human emotions in textual conversations. In this paper,
    we carried out different systems to analyze the emotions of textual dialogue from
    SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext for English language. Our main contribution is
    the integration of emotional and sentimental features in the classification using
    the SVM algorithm.'

    2019, by extending the existing methods for class imbalance problem. Reducing
    the distance between the distribution of prediction and ground truth, they consistently
    show positive effects on the performance. Also we propose a novel neural architecture

  abstract: Emotion identification is a process of identifying the emotions automatically
    from text, speech or images. Emotion identification from textual conversations
    is a challenging problem due to absence of gestures, vocal intonation and facial
    expressions. It enables conversational agents, chat bots and messengers to detect
    and report the emotions to the user instantly for a healthy conversation by avoiding
    emotional cues and miscommunications. We have adopted a Seq2Seq deep neural network
    to identify the emotions present in the text sequences. Several layers namely
    embedding layer, encoding-decoding layer, softmax layer and a loss layer are used
    to map the sequences from textual conversations to the emotions namely Angry,
    Happy, Sad and Others. We have evaluated our approach on the EmoContext@SemEval2019
    dataset and we have obtained the micro-averaged F1 scores as 0.595 and 0.6568
    for the pre-evaluation dataset and final evaluation test set respectively. Our
    approach improved the base line score by 7% for final evaluation test set.

  abstract: Emotion detection from user-generated contents is growing in importance
    in the area of natural language processing. The approach we proposed for the EmoContext
    task is based on the combination of a CNN and an LSTM using a concatenation of
    word embeddings. A stack of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used for capturing
    the hierarchical hidden relations among embedding features. Meanwhile, a long
    short-term memory network (LSTM) is used for capturing information shared among
    words of the sentence. Each conversation has been formalized as a list of word
    embeddings, in particular during experimental runs pre-trained Glove and Google
    word embeddings have been evaluated. Surface lexical features have been also considered,
    but they have been demonstrated to be not usefully for the classification in this
    specific task. The final system configuration achieved a micro F1 score of 0.7089.
    The python code of the system is fully available at https://github.com/marcopoli/EmoContext2019

    on detecting emotions in English textual conversations between a human and a chatbot.
    We propose four neural systems and combine them to further improve the results.
    We show that our neural ensemble systems can successfully distinguish three emotions
    (SAD, HAPPY, and ANGRY) and separate them from the rest (OTHERS) in a highly-imbalanced
    scenario. Our best system achieved a 0.77 F1-score and was ranked fourth out of
    165 submissions.

  abstract: "With the development of the Internet, dialog systems are widely used\
    \ in online platforms to provide personalized services for their users. It is\
    \ important to understand the emotions through conversations to improve the quality\
    \ of dialog systems. To facilitate the researches on dialog emotion recognition,\
    \ the SemEval-2019 Task 3 named EmoContext is proposed. This task aims to classify\
    \ the emotions of user utterance along with two short turns of dialogues into\
    \ four categories. In this paper, we propose an attentional LSTM-CNN model to\
    \ participate in this shared task. We use a combination of convolutional neural\
    \ networks and long-short term neural networks to capture both local and long-distance\
    \ contextual information in conversations. In addition, we apply attention mechanism\
    \ to recognize and attend to important words within conversations. Besides, we\
    \ propose to use ensemble strategies by combing the variants of our model with\
    \ different pre-trained word embeddings via weighted voting. Our model achieved\
    \ 0.7542 micro-F1 score in the final test data, ranking 15\u02C6th out of 165\

  abstract: This paper describes our approach to the sentiment analysis of Twitter
    textual conversations based on deep learning. We analyze the syntax, abbreviations,
    and informal-writing of Twitter; and perform perfect data preprocessing on the
    data to convert them to normative text. We apply a multi-step ensemble strategy
    to solve the problem of extremely unbalanced data in the training set. This is
    achieved by taking the GloVe and Elmo word vectors as input into a combination
    model with four different deep neural networks. The experimental results from
    the development dataset demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits a strong
    generalization ability. For evaluation on the best dataset, we integrated the
    results using the stacking ensemble learning approach and achieved competitive
    results. According to the final official review, the results of our model ranked
    10th out of 165 teams.

  abstract: In the age of emerging volume of microblog platforms, especially twitter,
    hate speech propagation is now of great concern. However, due to the brevity of
    tweets and informal user generated contents, detecting and analyzing hate speech
    on twitter is a formidable task. In this paper, we present our approach for detecting
    hate speech in tweets defined in the SemEval-2019 Task 5. Our team KDEHatEval
    employs different neural network models including multi-kernel convolution (MKC),
    nested LSTMs (NLSTMs), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in a unified architecture.
    Moreover, we utilize the state-of-the-art pre-trained sentence embedding models
    including DeepMoji, InferSent, and BERT for effective tweet representation. We
    analyze the performance of our method and demonstrate the contribution of each
    component of our architecture.

  abstract: 'Hate speech occurs more often than ever and polarizes society. To help
    counter this polarization, SemEval 2019 organizes a shared task called the Multilingual
    Detection of Hate. The first task (A) is to decide whether a given tweet contains
    hate against immigrants or women, in a multilingual perspective, for English and
    Spanish. In the second task (B), the system is also asked to classify the following
    sub-tasks: hateful tweets as aggressive or not aggressive, and to identify the
    target harassed as individual or generic. We evaluate multiple models, and finally
    combine them in an ensemble setting. This ensemble setting is built of five and
    three submodels for the English and Spanish task respectively. In the current
    setup it shows that using a bigger ensemble for English tweets performs mediocre,
    while a slightly smaller ensemble does work well for detecting hate speech in
    Spanish tweets. Our results on the test set for English show 0.378 macro F1 on
    task A and 0.553 macro F1 on task B. For Spanish the results are significantly
    higher, 0.701 macro F1 on task A and 0.734 macro F1 for task B.'

  abstract: This paper describes the GSI-UPM system for SemEval-2019 Task 5, which
    tackles multilingual detection of hate speech on Twitter. The main contribution
    of the paper is the use of a method based on word embeddings and semantic similarity
    combined with traditional paradigms, such as n-grams, TF-IDF and POS. This combination
    of several features is fine-tuned through ablation tests, demonstrating the usefulness
    of different features. While our approach outperforms baseline classifiers on
    different sub-tasks, the best of our submitted runs reached the 5th position on
    the Spanish sub-task A.

  abstract: This paper describes the system we developed for SemEval 2019 on Multilingual
    detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter (HatEval - Task
    5). We use an approach based on an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent
    Neural Network. In particular, we build a Bidirectional LSTM to extract information
    from the word embeddings over the sentence, then apply attention over the hidden
    states to estimate the importance of each word and finally feed this context vector
    to another LSTM model to get a representation. Then, the output obtained with
    this model is used to get the prediction of each of the sub-tasks.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach to detect hate speech against
    women and immigrants on Twitter in a multilingual context, English and Spanish.
    This challenge was proposed by the SemEval-2019 Task 5, where participants should
    develop models for hate speech detection, a two-class classification where systems
    have to predict whether a tweet in English or in Spanish with a given target (women
    or immigrants) is hateful or not hateful (Task A), and whether the hate speech
    is directed at a specific person or a group of individuals (Task B). For this,
    we implemented a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using pre-trained word embeddings
    (GloVe and FastText) with 300 dimensions. Our proposed model obtained in Task
    A 0.488 and 0.696 F1-score for English and Spanish, respectively. For Task B,
    the CNN obtained 0.297 and 0.430 EMR for English and Spanish, respectively.

    show good classification performance on the training data, but a considerable

  abstract: This document describes a text change of representation approach to the
    task of Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in
    Twitter, as part of SemEval-2019 1 . The task is divided in two sub-tasks. Sub-task
    A consists in classifying tweets as being hateful or not hateful, whereas sub-task
    B requires fine tuning the classification by classifying the hateful tweets as
    being directed to single individuals or generic, if the tweet is aggressive or
    not. Our approach consists of a change of the space of representation of text
    into statistical descriptors which characterize the text. In addition, dimensional
    reduction is performed to 6 characteristics per class in order to make the method
    suitable for a Big Data environment. Frequency Analysis Interpolation (FAI) is
    the approach we use to achieve rank 5th in Spanish language and 9th in English
    language in sub-task B in both cases.

  abstract: 'We present a number of models used for hate speech detection for Semeval
    2019 Task-5: Hateval. We evaluate the viability of multilingual learning for this
    task. We also experiment with adversarial learning as a means of creating a multilingual
    model. Ultimately our multilingual models have had worse results than their monolignual
    counterparts. We find that the choice of word representations (word embeddings)
    is very crucial for deep learning as a simple switch between MUSE and ELMo embeddings
    has shown a 3-4% increase in accuracy. This also shows the importance of context
    when dealing with online content.'

  abstract: 'Misogyny and xenophobia are some of the most important social problems.
    With the in- crease in the use of social media, this feeling ofhatred towards
    women and immigrants can be more easily expressed, therefore it can cause harmful
    effects on social media users. For this reason, it is important to develop systems
    ca- pable of detecting hateful comments automatically. In this paper, we describe
    our system to analyze the hate speech in English and Spanish tweets against Immigrants
    and Women as part of our participation in SemEval-2019 Task 5: hatEval. Our main
    contribution is the integration of three individual algorithms of predic- tion
    in a model based on Vote ensemble classifier.'

    in SemEval 2019, called HatEval. We have applied some classic neural network layers,
    like word embeddings and LSTM, to build a neural classifier for both proposed
    tasks. Due to the small amount of training data provided compared to what is expected
    for an adequate learning stage in deep architectures, we explore the use of paraphrasing
    tools as source for data augmentation. Our results show that this method is promising,
    as some improvement has been found over non-augmented training sets.

  abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to detection of hate speech against
    women and immigrants in tweets for our participation in the SemEval-2019 Task
    5. We trained an SVM and an RF classifier using character bi- and trigram features
    and a BiLSTM pre-initialized with external word embeddings. We combined the predictions
    of the SVM, RF and BiLSTM in two different ensemble models. The first was a majority
    vote of the binary values, and the second used the average of the confidence scores.
    For development, we got the highest accuracy (75%) by the final ensemble model
    with majority voting. For testing, all models scored substantially lower and the
    scores between the classifiers varied more. We believe that these large differences
    between the higher accuracies in the development phase and the lower accuracies
    we obtained in the testing phase have partly to do with differences between the
    training, development and testing data.

    forums and most notably, social media networks, led to a large spreading of hatred
    or abusive messages which have to be moderated. This paper proposes a supervised
    approach to hate speech detection towards immigrants and women in English tweets.
    Several models have been developed ranging from feature-engineering approaches
    to neural ones.

  abstract: The detection of hate speech, especially in online platforms and forums,
    is quickly becoming a hot topic as anti-hate speech legislation begins to be applied
    to public discourse online. The HatEval shared task was created with this in mind;
    participants were expected to develop a model capable of determining whether or
    not input (in this case, Twitter datasets in English and Spanish) could be considered
    hate speech (designated as Task A), if they were aggressive, and whether the tweet
    was targeting an individual, or speaking generally (Task B). We approached this
    task by creating an LSTM model with an embedding layer. We found that our model
    performed considerably better on English language input when compared to Spanish
    language input. In English, we achieved an F1-Score of 0.466 for Task A and 0.462
    for Task B; In Spanish, we achieved scores of 0.617 and 0.612 on Task A and Task
    B, respectively.

    which could serve in a near future as a reference to compare with deep learning
    systems. We participated in both task A (Hate Speech Detection against Immigrants
    and Women) and task B (Aggressive behavior and Target Classification). Despite
    its simplicity, our system obtained a remarkable F1-score of 72.5 (sixth highest)

    \ including word-level n-gram and neural language models, and character-level\
    \ neural language models \u2013 to the problem of detecting hate speech and offensive\

  abstract: "With the proliferation and ubiquity of smart gadgets and smart devices,\
    \ across the world, data generated by them has been growing at exponential rates;\
    \ in particular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have\
    \ been generating voluminous data on a daily basis. According to Twitter\u2019\
    s usage statistics, about 500 million tweets are generated each day. While the\
    \ tweets reflect the users\u2019 opinions on several events across the world,\
    \ there are tweets which are offensive in nature that need to be tagged under\
    \ the hateful conduct policy of Twitter. Offensive tweets have to be identified,\
    \ captured and processed further, for a variety of reasons, which include i) identifying\
    \ offensive tweets in order to prevent violent/abusive behavior in Twitter (or\
    \ any social media for that matter), ii) creating and maintaining a history of\
    \ offensive tweets for individual users (would be helpful in creating meta-data\
    \ for user profile), iii) inferring the sentiment of the users on particular event/issue/topic\
    \ . We have employed neural network models which manipulate attention with Temporal\
    \ Convolutional Neural Network for the three shared sub-tasks i) ATT-TCN (ATTention\
    \ based Temporal Convolutional Neural Network) employed for shared sub-task A\
    \ that yielded a best macro-F1 score of 0.46, ii) SAE-ATT-TCN(Self Attentive Embedding-ATTention\
    \ based Temporal Convolutional Neural Network) employed for shared sub-task B\
    \ and sub-task C that yielded best macro-F1 score of 0.61 and 0.51 respectively.\
    \ Among the two variants ATT-TCN and SAE-ATT-TCN, the latter performed better."

  abstract: We describe the CAMsterdam team entry to the SemEval-2019 Shared Task
    6 on offensive language identification in Twitter data. Our proposed model learns
    to extract textual features using a multi-layer recurrent network, and then performs
    text classification using gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT). A self-attention
    architecture enables the model to focus on the most relevant areas in the text.
    In order to enrich input representations, we use node2vec to learn globally optimised
    embeddings for hashtags, which are then given as additional features to the GBDT
    classifier. Our best model obtains 78.79% macro F1-score on detecting offensive
    language (subtask A), 66.32% on categorising offence types (targeted/untargeted;
    subtask B), and 55.36% on identifying the target of offence (subtask C).

  abstract: Offensive language has become pervasive in social media. In Offensive
    Language Identification tasks, it may be difficult to predict accurately only
    according to the surface words. So we try to dig deeper semantic information of
    text. This paper presents use an attention-based two layers bidirectional longshort
    memory neural network (BiLSTM) for semantic feature extraction. Additionally,
    a residual connection mechanism is used to synthesize two different deep features,
    and an emoji attention mechanism is used to extract semantic information of emojis
    in text. We participated in three sub-tasks of SemEval 2019 Task 6 as CN-HIT-MI.T
    team. Our macro-averaged F1-score in sub-task A is 0.768, ranking 28/103. We got
    0.638 in sub-task B, ranking 30/75. In sub-task C, we got 0.549, ranking 22/65.
    We also tried some other methods of not submitting results.

  abstract: This paper presents the application of two strong baseline systems for
    toxicity detection and evaluates their performance in identifying and categorizing
    offensive language in social media. PERSPECTIVE is an API, that serves multiple
    machine learning models for the improvement of conversations online, as well as
    a toxicity detection system, trained on a wide variety of comments from platforms
    across the Internet. BERT is a recently popular language representation model,
    fine tuned per task and achieving state of the art performance in multiple NLP
    tasks. PERSPECTIVE performed better than BERT in detecting toxicity, but BERT
    was much better in categorizing the offensive type. Both baselines were ranked
    surprisingly high in the SEMEVAL-2019 OFFENSEVAL competition, PERSPECTIVE in detecting
    an offensive post (12th) and BERT in categorizing it (11th). The main contribution
    of this paper is the assessment of two strong baselines for the identification
    (PERSPECTIVE) and the categorization (BERT) of offensive language with little
    or no additional training data.

  abstract: This paper presents the participation of team DA-LD-Hildesheim of Information
    Retrieval and Language Processing lab at DA-IICT, India in Semeval-19 OffenEval
    track. The aim of this shared task is to identify offensive content at fined-grained
    level granularity. The task is divided into three sub-tasks. The system is required
    to check whether social media posts contain any offensive or profane content or
    not, targeted or untargeted towards any entity and classifying targeted posts
    into the individual, group or other categories. Social media posts suffer from
    data sparsity problem, Therefore, the distributed word representation technique
    is chosen over the Bag-of-Words for the text representation. Since limited labeled
    data was available for the training, pre-trained word vectors are used and fine-tuned
    on this classification task. Various deep learning models based on LSTM, Bidirectional
    LSTM, CNN, and Stacked CNN are used for the classification. It has been observed
    that labeled data was highly affected with class imbalance and our technique to
    handle the class-balance was not effective, in fact performance was degraded in
    some of the runs. Macro F1 score is used as a primary evaluation metric for the
    performance. Our System achieves Macro F1 score = 0.7833 in sub-task A, 0.6456
    in the sub-task B and 0.5533 in the sub-task C.

  abstract: This paper describes the system we developed for SemEval 2019 on Identifying
    and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval - Task 6). The
    task focuses on offensive language in tweets. It is organized into three sub-tasks
    for offensive language identification; automatic categorization of offense types
    and offense target identification. The approach for the first subtask is a deep
    learning-based ensemble method which uses a Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural
    Network and a Convolutional Neural Network. Additionally we use the information
    from part-of-speech tagging of tweets for target identification and combine previous
    results for categorization of offense types.

    entitled Emad, on the OffensEval 2019 shared task organized at SemEval 2019 are
    presented. The OffensEval shared task includes three sub-tasks namely Offensive
    language identification, Automatic categorization of offense types and Offense
    target identification. We participated in sub-task A and tried various methods
    including traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods and also
    a combination of the first two sets of methods. We also proposed a data augmentation
    method using word embedding to improve the performance of our methods. The results
    show that the augmentation approach outperforms other methods in terms of macro-f1.

    A and B of the OffensEval shared task at SemEval 2019. OffensEval addresses the
    problem of identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media in
    three subtasks; whether or not a content is offensive (subtask A), whether it
    is targeted (subtask B) towards an individual, a group, or other entities (subtask
    C). The proposed approach includes character-level Convolutional Neural Network,
    word-level Recurrent Neural Network, and some preprocessing. The performance achieved
    by the proposed model is 77.93% macro-averaged F1-score.

    Automatic categorization of offense types\u201D and sub-task C - \u201COffense\
    \ target identification\u201D. As a baseline model we used a Long short-term memory\
    \ recurrent neural network (LSTM) to identify and categorize offensive tweets.\
    \ For all the tasks we experimented with external databases in a postprocessing\
    \ step to enhance the results made by our model. The best macro-average F1 scores\
    \ obtained for the sub-tasks A, B and C are 0.73, 0.52, and 0.37, respectively."

  abstract: In this paper, we present two methods to identify and categorize the offensive
    language in Twitter. In the first method, we establish a probabilistic model to
    evaluate the sentence offensiveness level and target level according to different
    sub-tasks. In the second method, we develop a deep neural network consisting of
    bidirectional recurrent layers with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells and fully
    connected layers. In the comparison of two methods, we find both method has its
    own advantages and drawbacks while they have similar accuracy.

    \ We use an end-to-end model (i.e., no preprocessing) and fine-tune pre-trained\
    \ embeddings (FastText) during training for learning words\u2019 representation.\
    \ We compare the proposed CNN model to a baseline model, such as Linear Regression,\
    \ and several neural models. The results show that CNN outperforms other models,\

    task. The OffensEval Shared Task was conducted in SemEval 2019 workshop. To develop
    the system, we have explored n-grams up to 8-gram and trained three different
    namely A, B and C systems for three different subtasks within the OffensEval task
    which achieves 79.76%, 87.91% and 44.37% accuracy respectively. The task was completed
    using the dataset provided to us by the OffensEval organisers was the part of
    OLID dataset. It consists of 13,240 tweets extracted from twitter and were annotated
    at three levels using crowdsourcing.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present our approach and the system description for
    Sub Task A and Sub Task B of SemEval 2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing
    Offensive Language in Social Media. Sub Task A involves identifying if a given
    tweet is offensive and Sub Task B involves detecting if an offensive tweet is
    targeted towards someone (group or an individual). Our models for Sub Task A is
    based on an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional LSTM, whereas
    for Sub Task B, we rely on a set of heuristics derived from the training data.
    We provide detailed analysis of the results obtained using the trained models.
    Our team ranked 5th out of 103 participants in Sub Task A, achieving a macro F1
    score of 0.807, and ranked 8th out of 75 participants achieving a macro F1 of
    0.695.'

  abstract: This paper presents our submission for the SemEval shared task 6, sub-task
    A on the identification of offensive language. Our proposed model, C-BiGRU, combines
    a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN). We utilize word2vec to capture the semantic similarities between words.
    This composition allows us to extract long term dependencies in tweets and distinguish
    between offensive and non-offensive tweets. In addition, we evaluate our approach
    on a different dataset and show that our model is capable of detecting online
    aggressiveness in both English and German tweets. Our model achieved a macro F1-score
    of 79.40% on the SemEval dataset.

  abstract: The rise of social media has made information exchange faster and easier
    among the people. However, in recent times, the use of offensive language has
    seen an upsurge in social media. The main challenge for a service provider is
    to correctly identify such offensive posts and take necessary action to monitor
    and control their spread. In this work, we try to address this problem by using
    sophisticated deep learning techniques like LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM and Bidirectional
    GRU. Our proposed approach solves 3 different Sub-tasks provided in the SemEval-2019
    task 6 which incorporates identification of offensive tweets as well as their
    categorization. We obtain significantly better results in the leader-board for
    Sub-task B and decent results for Sub-task A and Subtask C validating the fact
    that the proposed models can be used for automating the offensive post-detection
    task in social media.

    For this reason, it is important to develop systems capable of identifying and

  abstract: Offensive language identification (OLI) in user generated text is automatic
    detection of any profanity, insult, obscenity, racism or vulgarity that degrades
    an individual or a group. It is helpful for hate speech detection, flame detection
    and cyber bullying. Due to immense growth of accessibility to social media, OLI
    helps to avoid abuse and hurts. In this paper, we present deep and traditional
    machine learning approaches for OLI. In deep learning approach, we have used bi-directional
    LSTM with different attention mechanisms to build the models and in traditional
    machine learning, TF-IDF weighting schemes with classifiers namely Multinomial
    Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines with Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer
    are used for model building. The approaches are evaluated on the OffensEval@SemEval2019
    dataset and our team SSN_NLP submitted runs for three tasks of OffensEval shared
    task. The best runs of SSN_NLP obtained the F1 scores as 0.53, 0.48, 0.3 and the
    accuracies as 0.63, 0.84 and 0.42 for the tasks A, B and C respectively. Our approaches
    improved the base line F1 scores by 12%, 26% and 14% for Task A, B and C respectively.

  abstract: This paper summarizes the participation of Stop PropagHate team at SemEval
    2019. Our approach is based on replicating one of the most relevant works on the
    literature, using word embeddings and LSTM. After circumventing some of the problems
    of the original code, we found poor results when applying it to the HatEval contest
    (F1=0.45). We think this is due mainly to inconsistencies in the data of this
    contest. Finally, for the OffensEval the classifier performed well (F1=0.74),
    proving to have a better performance for offense detection than for hate speech.

    \ by string matching technique supported by offensive and bad words dictionary.\
    \ The second system uses a multi-branch 1D CNN classifier with Glove pre-trained\
    \ embedding layer for the first level of classification and string matching for\
    \ the second level of classification. Input data with a probability of less than\

    \ language detection. For our system, we compare two types of knowledge transfer:\
    \ supervised and unsupervised pre-training. Supervised pre-training of our bidirectional\
    \ GRU-3-CNN architecture is performed as multi-task learning of parallel training\
    \ of five different tasks. The selected tasks are supervised classification problems\
    \ from public NLP resources with some overlap to offensive language such as sentiment\
    \ detection, emoji classification, and aggressive language classification. Unsupervised\
    \ transfer learning is performed with a thematic clustering of 40M unlabeled tweets\
    \ via LDA. Based on this dataset, pre-training is performed by predicting the\
    \ main topic of a tweet. Results indicate that unsupervised transfer from large\
    \ datasets performs slightly better than supervised training on small \u2018near\

  abstract: In this paper, we present a system description for the SemEval-2019 Task
    6 submitted by our team. For the task, our system takes tweet as an input and
    determine if the tweet is offensive or non-offensive (Sub-task A). In case a tweet
    is offensive, our system identifies if a tweet is targeted (insult or threat)
    or non-targeted like swearing (Sub-task B). In targeted tweets, our system identifies
    the target as an individual or group (Sub-task C). We used data pre-processing
    techniques like splitting hashtags into words, removing special characters, stop-word
    removal, stemming, lemmatization, capitalization, and offensive word dictionary.
    Later, we used keras tokenizer and word embeddings for feature extraction. For
    classification, we used the LSTM (Long short-term memory) model of keras framework.
    Our accuracy scores for Sub-task A, B and C are 0.8128, 0.8167 and 0.3662 respectively.
    Our results indicate that fine-grained classification to identify offense target
    was difficult for the system. Lastly, in the future scope section, we will discuss
    the ways to improve system performance.

  abstract: With the growth in the usage of social media, it has become increasingly
    common for people to hide behind a mask and abuse others. We have attempted to
    detect such tweets and comments that are malicious in intent, which either targets
    an individual or a group. Our best classifier for identifying offensive tweets
    for SubTask A (Classifying offensive vs. nonoffensive) has an accuracy of 83.14%
    and a f1- score of 0.7565 on the actual test data. For SubTask B, to identify
    if an offensive tweet is targeted (If targeted towards an individual or a group),
    the classifier performs with an accuracy of 89.17% and f1-score of 0.5885. The
    paper talks about how we generated linguistic and semantic features to build an
    ensemble machine learning model. By training with more extracts from different
    sources (Facebook, and more tweets), the paper shows how the accuracy changes
    with additional training data.

  abstract: 'This document describes the submission of team YNU-HPCC to SemEval-2019
    for three Sub-tasks of Task 6: Sub-task A, Sub-task B, and Sub-task C. We have
    submitted four systems to identify and categorise offensive language. The first
    subsystem is an attention-based 2-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM).
    The second subsystem is a voting ensemble of four different deep learning architectures.
    The third subsystem is a stacking ensemble of four different deep learning architectures.
    Finally, the fourth subsystem is a bidirectional encoder representations from
    transformers (BERT) model. Among our models, in Sub-task A, our first subsystem
    performed the best, ranking 16th among 103 teams; in Sub-task B, the second subsystem
    performed the best, ranking 12th among 75 teams; in Sub-task C, the fourth subsystem
    performed best, ranking 4th among 65 teams.'

  abstract: 'Hyperpartisan news is news that takes an extreme left-wing or right-wing
    standpoint. If one is able to reliably compute this meta information, news articles
    may be automatically tagged, this way encouraging or discouraging readers to consume
    the text. It is an open question how successfully hyperpartisan news detection
    can be automated, and the goal of this SemEval task was to shed light on the state
    of the art. We developed new resources for this purpose, including a manually
    labeled dataset with 1,273 articles, and a second dataset with 754,000 articles,
    labeled via distant supervision. The interest of the research community in our
    task exceeded all our expectations: The datasets were downloaded about 1,000 times,
    322 teams registered, of which 184 configured a virtual machine on our shared
    task cloud service TIRA, of which in turn 42 teams submitted a valid run. The
    best team achieved an accuracy of 0.822 on a balanced sample (yes : no hyperpartisan)
    drawn from the manually tagged corpus; an ensemble of the submitted systems increased
    the accuracy by 0.048.'

  abstract: "Since the first RumourEval shared task in 2017, interest in automated\
    \ claim validation has greatly increased, as the danger of \u201Cfake news\u201D\
    \ has become a mainstream concern. However automated support for rumour verification\
    \ remains in its infancy. It is therefore important that a shared task in this\
    \ area continues to provide a focus for effort, which is likely to increase. Rumour\
    \ verification is characterised by the need to consider evolving conversations\
    \ and news updates to reach a verdict on a rumour\u2019s veracity. As in RumourEval\
    \ 2017 we provided a dataset of dubious posts and ensuing conversations in social\
    \ media, annotated both for stance and veracity. The social media rumours stem\
    \ from a variety of breaking news stories and the dataset is expanded to include\
    \ Reddit as well as new Twitter posts. There were two concrete tasks; rumour stance\
    \ prediction and rumour verification, which we present in detail along with results\
    \ achieved by participants. We received 22 system submissions (a 70% increase\
    \ from RumourEval 2017) many of which used state-of-the-art methodology to tackle\
    \ the challenges involved."

    Answering Forums, which features two subtasks. Subtask A is about deciding whether
    a question asks for factual information vs. an opinion/advice vs. just socializing.
    Subtask B asks to predict whether an answer to a factual question is true, false
    or not a proper answer. We received 17 official submissions for subtask A and
    11 official submissions for Subtask B. For subtask A, all systems improved over
    the majority class baseline. For Subtask B, all systems were below a majority
    class baseline, but several systems were very close to it. The leaderboard and

  abstract: Fact checking is an important task for maintaining high quality posts
    and improving user experience in Community Question Answering forums. Therefore,
    the SemEval-2019 task 8 is aimed to identify factual question (subtask A) and
    detect true factual information from corresponding answers (subtask B). In order
    to address this task, we propose a system based on the BERT model with meta information
    of questions. For the subtask A, the outputs of fine-tuned BERT classification
    model are combined with the feature of length of questions to boost the performance.
    For the subtask B, the predictions of several variants of BERT model encoding
    the meta information are combined to create an ensemble model. Our system achieved
    competitive results with an accuracy of 0.82 in the subtask A and 0.83 in the
    subtask B. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our system.

  abstract: We present the pilot SemEval task on Suggestion Mining. The task consists
    of subtasks A and B, where we created labeled data from feedback forum and hotel
    reviews respectively. Subtask A provides training and test data from the same
    domain, while Subtask B evaluates the system on a test dataset from a different
    domain than the available training data. 33 teams participated in the shared task,
    with a total of 50 members. We summarize the problem definition, benchmark dataset
    preparation, and methods used by the participating teams, providing details of
    the methods used by the top ranked systems. The dataset is made freely available
    to help advance the research in suggestion mining, and reproduce the systems submitted
    under this task

  abstract: This paper presents our system to the SemEval-2019 Task 9, Suggestion
    Mining from Online Reviews and Forums. The goal of this task is to extract suggestions
    such as the expressions of tips, advice, and recommendations. We explore Bidirectional
    Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) focusing on target domain pre-training
    in Subtask A which provides training and test datasets in the same domain. In
    Subtask B, the cross domain suggestion mining task, we apply the idea of distant
    supervision. Our system obtained the third place in Subtask A and the fifth place
    in Subtask B, which demonstrates its efficacy of our approaches.

  abstract: We report on the SemEval 2019 task on math question answering. We provided
    a question set derived from Math SAT practice exams, including 2778 training questions
    and 1082 test questions. For a significant subset of these questions, we also
    provided SMT-LIB logical form annotations and an interpreter that could solve
    these logical forms. Systems were evaluated based on the percentage of correctly
    answered questions. The top system correctly answered 45% of the test questions,
    a considerable improvement over the 17% random guessing baseline.

  abstract: We present the SemEval-2019 Task 12 which focuses on toponym resolution
    in scientific articles. Given an article from PubMed, the task consists of detecting
    mentions of names of places, or toponyms, and mapping the mentions to their corresponding
    entries in GeoNames.org, a database of geospatial locations. We proposed three
    subtasks. In Subtask 1, we asked participants to detect all toponyms in an article.
    In Subtask 2, given toponym mentions as input, we asked participants to disambiguate
    them by linking them to entries in GeoNames. In Subtask 3, we asked participants
    to perform both the detection and the disambiguation steps for all toponyms. A
    total of 29 teams registered, and 8 teams submitted a system run. We summarize
    the corpus and the tools created for the challenge. They are freely available
    at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19948. We also analyze the methods,
    the results and the errors made by the competing systems with a focus on toponym
    disambiguation.

    \ BiLSTM-CRF model as backbone. A lot of strategies are adopted for further improvement,\
    \ such as pre-training, model ensemble, model averaging and data augment. For\
    \ toponym disambiguation, we adopted the widely used searching and ranking framework.\
    \ For ranking, we proposed several effective features for measuring the consistency\

  abstract: 'In the effort to tackle the challenge of Hyperpartisan News Detection,
    i.e., the task of deciding whether a news article is biased towards one party,
    faction, cause, or person, we experimented with two systems: i) a standard supervised
    learning approach using superficial text and bag-of-words features from the article
    title and body, and ii) a deep learning system comprising a four-layer convolutional
    neural network and max-pooling layers after the embedding layer, feeding the consolidated
    features to a bi-directional recurrent neural network. We achieved an F-score
    of 0.712 with our best approach, which corresponds to the mid-range of performance
    levels in the leaderboard.'

    based on word vector averages and hand-crafted linguistic features, and 2) a BiLSTM-based
    neural text classifier trained on a filtered training set. Surprisingly, despite
    their different nature, both approaches achieve an accuracy of 0.74. The main
    focus of this paper is to further analyze the remarkable fact that a simple feature-based
    approach can perform on par with modern neural classifiers. We also highlight
    the effectiveness of our filtering strategy for training the neural network on
    a large but noisy training set.'

    as part of a SemEval 2019 task. We developed an XGBoost based system which uses
    character and word level n-gram features represented using TF-IDF, count vector
    based correlation matrix, and predicts if an input news article is a hyperpartisan
    news article. Our model was able to achieve a precision of 68.3% on the test set
    provided by the contest organizers. We also run our model on the BuzzFeed corpus
    and find XGBoost with simple character level N-Gram embeddings to be performing
    well with an accuracy of around 96%.

  abstract: In a world of information operations, influence campaigns, and fake news,
    classification of news articles as following hyperpartisan argumentation or not
    is becoming increasingly important. We present a deep learning-based approach
    in which a pre-trained language model has been fine-tuned on domain-specific data
    and used for classification of news articles, as part of the SemEval-2019 task
    on hyperpartisan news detection. The suggested approach yields accuracy and F1-scores
    around 0.8 which places the best performing classifier among the top-5 systems
    in the competition.

    Detection shared task at SemEval 2019. Motivated by the late arrival of Doris
    Martin, we test a previously developed document classification system which consists
    of a combination of clustering features implemented on top of some simple shallow
    local features. We show how leveraging distributional features obtained from large
    in-domain unlabeled data helps to easily and quickly develop a reasonably good
    performing system for detecting hyperpartisan news. The system and models generated
    for this task are publicly available.

  abstract: "This paper describes the Pioquinto Manterola Hyperpartisan News Detector,\
    \ which participated in SemEval-2019 Task 4. Hyperpartisan news is highly polarized\
    \ and takes a very biased or one\u2013sided view of a particular story. We developed\
    \ two variants of our system, the more successful was a Logistic Regression classifier\
    \ based on unigram features. This was our official entry in the task, and it placed\
    \ 23rd of 42 participating teams. Our second variant was a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network that did not perform as well."

    \ these features, we see improvements in our evaluation metrics compared to the\
    \ baseline values. We find that sentiment analysis helps improve our evaluation\

    \ achieves an accuracy of 0.739, finishing 18th out of 42 submissions to the task.\
    \ From our work, it is evident that both title features and sentiment of articles\
    \ are meaningful to the hyperpartisanship of news articles."

  abstract: We investigate the recently developed Bidi- rectional Encoder Representations
    from Transformers (BERT) model (Devlin et al. 2018) for the hyperpartisan news
    detection task. Using a subset of hand-labeled articles from SemEval as a validation
    set, we test the performance of different parameters for BERT models. We find
    that accuracy from two different BERT models using different proportions of the
    articles is consistently high, with our best-performing model on the validation
    set achieving 85% accuracy and the best-performing model on the test set achieving
    77%. We further determined that our model exhibits strong consistency, labeling
    independent slices of the same article identically. Finally, we find that randomizing
    the order of word pieces dramatically reduces validation accuracy (to approximately
    60%), but that shuffling groups of four or more word pieces maintains an accuracy
    of about 80%, indicating the model mainly gains value from local context.

  abstract: We use the 600 hand-labelled articles from SemEval Task 4 to hand-tune
    a classifier with 3000 features for the Hyperpartisan News Detection task. Our
    final system uses features based on bag-of-words (BoW), analysis of the article
    title, language complexity, and simple sentiment analysis in a naive Bayes classifier.
    We trained our final system on the 600,000 articles labelled by publisher. Our
    final system has an accuracy of 0.653 on the hand-labeled test set. The most effective
    features are the Automated Readability Index and the presence of certain words
    in the title. This suggests that hyperpartisan writing uses a distinct writing
    style, especially in the title.

  abstract: This paper describes the system of NLP@UIT that participated in Task 4
    of SemEval-2019. We developed a system that predicts whether an English news article
    follows a hyperpartisan argumentation. Paparazzo is the name of our system and
    is also the code name of our team in Task 4 of SemEval-2019. The Paparazzo system,
    in which we use tri-grams of words and hepta-grams of characters, officially ranks
    thirteen with an accuracy of 0.747. Another system of ours, which utilizes trigrams
    of words, tri-grams of characters, trigrams of part-of-speech, syntactic dependency
    sub-trees, and named-entity recognition tags, achieved an accuracy of 0.787 and
    is proposed after the deadline of Task 4.

    years, hyperpartisan news detection is still an underresearched topic. This paper
    presents our work towards building a classification system for hyperpartisan news
    detection in the context of the SemEval2019 shared task 4. We experiment with
    two different approaches - a more stylistic one, and a more content related one
    - achieving average results.

    determining whether an article is heavily biased towards one side of the political
    spectrum. Our system receives an article in its raw, textual form, analyzes it,
    and predicts with moderate accuracy whether the article is hyperpartisan. The
    learning model used was primarily trained on a manually prelabeled dataset containing
    news articles. The system relies on the previously constructed SVM model, available
    in the Python Scikit-Learn library. We ranked 6th in the competition of 42 teams
    with an accuracy of 79.1% (the winning team had 82.2%).'

    \ To this goal, we follow a feature-based approach and perform several experiments\
    \ with different machine learning classifiers. Additionally, we explore feature\
    \ importances and distributions among the two classes. On the main task, our model\
    \ achieved an accuracy of 71.7%, which was improved after the task\u2019s end\
    \ to 72.9%. We also participate on the meta-learning sub-task, for classifying\

    Task 4 on Hyperpartisan News Detection. The task asked participants to predict
    whether a given article is hyperpartisan, i.e., extreme-left or extreme-right.
    We proposed an approach based on BERT with fine-tuning, which was ranked 7th out
    28 teams on the distantly supervised dataset, where all articles from a hyperpartisan/non-hyperpartisan
    news outlet are considered to be hyperpartisan/non-hyperpartisan. On a manually
    annotated test dataset, where human annotators double-checked the labels, we were
    ranked 29th out of 42 teams.

    Detection. We rely on a variety of engineered features originally used to detect
    propaganda. This is based on the assumption that biased messages are propagandistic
    and promote a particular political cause or viewpoint. In particular, we trained
    a logistic regression model with features ranging from simple bag of words to
    vocabulary richness and text readability. Our system achieved 72.9% accuracy on
    the manually annotated testset, and 60.8% on the test data that was obtained with
    distant supervision. Additional experiments showed that significant performance
    gains can be achieved with better feature pre-processing.

    handcrafted features into the CNN and using it as a feature extractor for a linear

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our attempt to learn bias from news articles.
    From our experiments, it seems that although there is a correlation between publisher
    bias and article bias, it is challenging to learn bias directly from the publisher
    labels. On the other hand, using few manually-labeled samples can increase the
    accuracy metric from around 60% to near 80%. Our system is computationally inexpensive
    and uses several standard document representations in NLP to train an SVM or LR
    classifier. The system ranked 4th in the SemEval-2019 task. The code is released
    for reproducibility.

  abstract: The viral spread of false, unverified and misleading information on the
    Internet has attracted a heightened attention of an interdisciplinary research
    community on the phenomenon. This paper contributes to the research efforts of
    automatically determining the veracity of rumourous tweets and classifying their
    replies according to stance. Our research objective was to investigate the interplay
    between a number of phenomenological and contextual features of rumours, in particular,
    we explore the extent to which network structural characteristics, metadata and
    user profiles could complement the linguistic analysis of the written content
    for the task at hand. The current findings strongly demonstrate that supplementary
    sources of information play significant role in classifying the veracity and the
    stance of Twitter interactions deemed to be rumourous.

  abstract: Researchers have been paying increasing attention to rumour evaluation
    due to the rapid spread of unsubstantiated rumours on social media platforms,
    including SemEval 2019 task 7. However, labelled data for learning rumour veracity
    is scarce, and labels in rumour stance data are highly disproportionate, making
    it challenging for a model to perform supervised-learning adequately. We propose
    an inference chain-based system, which fully utilizes conversation structure-based
    knowledge in the limited data and expand the training data in minority categories
    to alleviate class imbalance. Our approach obtains 12.6% improvement upon the
    baseline system for subtask A, ranks 1st among 21 systems in subtask A, and ranks
    4th among 12 systems in subtask B.

  abstract: "The paper presents Columbia team\u2019s participation in the SemEval\
    \ 2019 Shared Task 7: RumourEval 2019. Detecting rumour on social networks has\
    \ been a focus of research in recent years. Previous work suffered from data sparsity,\
    \ which potentially limited the application of more sophisticated neural architecture\
    \ to this task. We mitigate this problem by proposing a multi-task learning approach\
    \ together with language model fine-tuning. Our attention-based model allows different\
    \ tasks to leverage different level of information. Our system ranked 6th overall\
    \ with an F1-score of 36.25 on stance classification and F1 of 22.44 on rumour\
    \ verification."

  abstract: Social media plays a crucial role as the main resource news for information
    seekers online. However, the unmoderated feature of social media platforms lead
    to the emergence and spread of untrustworthy contents which harm individuals or
    even societies. Most of the current automated approaches for automatically determining
    the veracity of a rumor are not generalizable for novel emerging topics. This
    paper describes our hybrid system comprising rules and a machine learning model
    which makes use of replied tweets to identify the veracity of the source tweet.
    The proposed system in this paper achieved 0.435 F-Macro in stance classification,
    and 0.262 F-macro and 0.801 RMSE in rumor verification tasks in Task7 of SemEval
    2019.

  abstract: Since the resources of Community Question Answering are abundant and information
    sharing becomes universal, it will be increasingly difficult to find factual information
    for questioners in massive messages. SemEval 2019 task 8 is focusing on these
    issues. We participate in the task and use Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (OpenAI GPT) as our system. Our innovations are data extension, feature extraction,
    and input transformation. For contextual knowledge enhancement, we extend the
    training set of subtask A, use several features to improve the results of our
    system and adapt the input formats to be more suitable for this task. We demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our approaches, which achieves 81.95% of subtask A and 61.08%
    of subtask B in accuracy on the SemEval 2019 task 8.

  abstract: 'Community Question Answering forums are very popular nowadays, as they
    represent effective means for communities to share information around particular
    topics. But the information shared on these forums are often not authentic. This
    paper presents the ColumbiaNLP submission for the SemEval-2019 Task 8: Fact-Checking
    in Community Question Answering Forums. We show how fine-tuning a language model
    on a large unannotated corpus of old threads from Qatar Living forum helps us
    to classify question types (factual, opinion, socializing) and to judge the factuality
    of answers on the shared task labeled data from the same forum. Our system finished
    4th and 2nd on Subtask A (question type classification) and B (answer factuality
    prediction), respectively, based on the official metric of accuracy.'

    of Thrace (DUTH) team for participating in SemEval-2019 Task 8: Fact Checking

    Classification. Our approach was based on shallow natural language processing
    (NLP) pre-processing techniques to reduce the noise in data, feature selection
    methods, and supervised machine learning algorithms such as NearestCentroid, Perceptron,
    and LinearSVC. To determine the essential features, we were aided by exploratory
    data analysis and visualizations. In order to improve classification accuracy,
    we developed a customized list of stopwords, retaining some opinion- and fact-denoting
    common function words which would have been removed by standard stoplisting. Furthermore,
    we examined the usefulness of part-of-speech (POS) categories for the task; by
    trying to remove nouns and adjectives, we found some evidence that verbs are a
    valuable POS category for the opinion question class.'

  abstract: Online Community Question Answering Forums (cQA) have gained massive popularity
    within recent years. The rise in users for such forums have led to the increase
    in the need for automated evaluation for question comprehension and fact evaluation
    of the answers provided by various participants in the forum. Our team, Fermi,
    participated in sub-task A of Task 8 at SemEval 2019 - which tackles the first
    problem in the pipeline of factual evaluation in cQA forums, i.e., deciding whether
    a posed question asks for a factual information, an opinion/advice or is just
    socializing. This information is highly useful in segregating factual questions
    from non-factual ones which highly helps in organizing the questions into useful
    categories and trims down the problem space for the next task in the pipeline
    for fact evaluation among the available answers. Our system uses the embeddings
    obtained from Universal Sentence Encoder combined with XGBoost for the classification
    sub-task A. We also evaluate other combinations of embeddings and off-the-shelf
    machine learning algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy of the various representations
    and their combinations. Our results across the evaluation test set gave an accuracy
    of 84% and received the first position in the final standings judged by the organizers.

  abstract: "We describe our system for SemEval-2019, Task 8 on \u201CFact-Checking\
    \ in Community Question Answering Forums (cQA)\u201D. cQA forums are very prevalent\
    \ nowadays, as they provide an effective means for communities to share knowledge.\
    \ Unfortunately, this shared information is not always factual and fact-verified.\
    \ In this task, we aim to identify factual questions posted on cQA and verify\
    \ the veracity of answers to these questions. Our approach relies on data augmentation\
    \ and aggregates cues from several dimensions such as semantics, linguistics,\
    \ syntax, writing style and evidence obtained from trusted external sources. In\
    \ subtask A, our submission is ranked 3rd, with an accuracy of 83.14%. Our current\
    \ best solution stands 1st on the leaderboard with 88% accuracy. In subtask B,\
    \ our present solution is ranked 2nd, with 58.33% MAP score."

  abstract: This paper describes the participation of DBMS-KU team in the SemEval
    2019 Task 9, that is, suggestion mining from online reviews and forums. To deal
    with this task, we explore several machine learning approaches, i.e., Random Forest
    (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Linear Support
    Vector Classification (LSVC), Sublinear Support Vector Classification (SSVC),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Variable Length Chromosome Genetic Algorithm-Naive
    Bayes (VLCGA-NB). Our system obtains reasonable results of F1-Score 0.47 and 0.37
    on the evaluation data in Subtask A and Subtask B, respectively. In particular,
    our obtained results outperform the baseline in Subtask A. Interestingly, the
    results seem to show that our system could perform well in classifying Non-suggestion
    class.

  abstract: Suggestion Mining is the task of classifying sentences into suggestions
    or non-suggestions. SemEval-2019 Task 9 sets the task to mine suggestions from
    online texts. For each of the two subtasks, the classification has to be applied
    on a different domain. Subtask A addresses the domain of posts in suggestion online
    forums and comes with a set of training examples, that is used for supervised
    training. A combination of LSTM and CNN networks is constructed to create a model
    which uses BERT word embeddings as input features. For subtask B, the domain of
    hotel reviews is regarded. In contrast to subtask A, no labeled data for supervised
    training is provided, so that additional unlabeled data is taken to apply a cross-domain
    classification. This is done by using adversarial training of the three model
    parts label classifier, domain classifier and the shared feature representation.
    For subtask A, the developed model archives a F1-score of 0.7273, which is in
    the top ten of the leader board. The F1-score for subtask B is 0.8187 and is ranked
    in the top five of the submissions for that task.

  abstract: Social media has an increasing amount of information that both customers
    and companies can benefit from. These social media posts can include Tweets or
    be in the form of vocalization of complements and complaints (e.g., reviews) of
    a product or service. Researchers have been actively mining this invaluable information
    source to automatically generate insights. Mining sentiments of customer reviews
    is an example that has gained momentum due to its potential to gather information
    that customers are not happy about. Instead of reading millions of reviews, companies
    prefer sentiment analysis to obtain feedback and to improve their products or
    services. In this work, we aim to identify information that companies can act
    on, or other customers can utilize for making their own experience better. This
    is different from identifying if reviews of a product or service is negative,
    positive, or neutral. To that end, we classify sentences of a given review as
    suggestion or not suggestion so that readers of the reviews do not have to go
    through thousands of reviews but instead can focus on actionable items and applicable
    suggestions. To identify suggestions within reviews, we employ a hybrid approach
    that utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) along with rule-based features
    to build a domain-independent suggestion mining model. In this way, a model trained
    on electronics reviews is used to extract suggestions from hotel reviews.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe a suggestion mining system that participated
    in SemEval 2019 Task 9, SubTask A - Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and
    Forums. Given some suggestions from online reviews and forums that can be classified
    into suggestion and non-suggestion classes. In this task, we combine the attention
    mechanism with the LSTM model, which is the final system we submitted. The final
    submission achieves 14th place in Task 9, SubTask A with the accuracy of 0.6776.
    After the challenge, we train a series of neural network models such as convolutional
    neural network(CNN), TextCNN, long short-term memory(LSTM) and C-LSTM. Finally,
    we make an ensemble on the predictions of these models and get a better result.

  abstract: "In this paper, we present neural model architecture submitted to the\
    \ SemEval-2019 Task 9 competition: \u201CSuggestion Mining from Online Reviews\
    \ and Forums\u201D. We participated in both subtasks for domain specific and also\
    \ cross-domain suggestion mining. We proposed a recurrent neural network architecture\
    \ that employs Bi-LSTM layers and also self-attention mechanism. Our architecture\
    \ tries to encode words via word representation using ELMo and ensembles multiple\
    \ models to achieve better results. We highlight importance of pre-processing\
    \ of user-generated samples and its contribution to overall results. We performed\
    \ experiments with different setups of our proposed model involving weighting\
    \ of prediction classes for loss function. Our best model achieved in official\
    \ test evaluation score of 0.6816 for subtask A and 0.6850 for subtask B. In official\
    \ results, we achieved 12th and 10th place in subtasks A and B, respectively."

  abstract: As online customer forums and product comparison sites increase their
    societal influence, users are actively expressing their opinions and posting their
    recommendations on their fellow customers online. However, systems capable of
    recognizing suggestions still lack in stability. Suggestion Mining, a novel and
    challenging field of Natural Language Processing, is increasingly gaining attention,
    aiming to track user advice on online forums. In this paper, a carefully designed
    methodology to identify customer-to-company and customer-to-customer suggestions
    is presented. The methodology implements a rule-based classifier using heuristic,
    lexical and syntactic patterns. The approach ranked at 5th and 1st position, achieving
    an f1-score of 0.749 and 0.858 for SemEval-2019/Suggestion Mining sub-tasks A
    and B, respectively. In addition, we were able to improve performance results
    by combining the rule-based classifier with a recurrent convolutional neural network,
    that exhibits an f1-score of 0.79 for subtask A.

    the task is focused on suggestion mining and it aims to classify given sentences
    into sug- gestion and non-suggestion classes in do- main specific and cross domain
    training setting respectively. We propose a multi- perspective architecture for
    learning rep- resentations by using different classical models including Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Feed Forward Attention (FFA),
    etc. To leverage the semantics distributed in large amount of unsupervised data,
    we also have adopted the pre-trained Bidi- rectional Encoder Representations from
    Transformers (BERT) model as an en- coder to produce sentence and word rep- resentations.
    The proposed architecture is applied for both sub-tasks, and achieved f1-score
    of 0.7812 for subtask A, and 0.8579 for subtask B. We won the first and second
    place for the two tasks respec- tively in the final competition.'

  abstract: This paper describes the work on mining the suggestions from online reviews
    and forums. Opinion mining detects whether the comments are positive, negative
    or neutral, while suggestion mining explores the review content for the possible
    tips or advice. The system developed by SSN-SPARKS team in SemEval-2019 for task
    9 (suggestion mining) uses a rule-based approach for feature selection, SMOTE
    technique for data augmentation and deep learning technique (Convolutional Neural
    Network) for classification. We have compared the results with Random Forest classifier
    (RF) and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Results show that the CNN model performs
    better than other models for both the subtasks.

  abstract: This paper describes the suggestion miner system that participates in
    SemEval 2019 Task 9 - SubTask A - Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums.
    The system participated in the subtasks A. This paper discusses the results of
    our system in the development, evaluation and post evaluation. Each class in the
    dataset is represented as directed unweighted graphs. Then, the comparison is
    carried out with each class graph which results in a vector. This vector is used
    as features by a machine learning algorithm. The model is evaluated on hold on
    strategy. The organizers randomly split (8500 instances) training set (provided
    to the participant in training their system) and testing set (833 instances).
    The test set is reserved to evaluate the performance of participants systems.
    During the evaluation, our system ranked 31 in the Coda Lab result of the subtask
    A (binary class problem). The binary class system achieves evaluation value 0.34,
    precision 0.87, recall 0.73 and F measure 0.78.

  abstract: This paper presents our submissions to SemEval-2019 Task9, Suggestion
    Mining. Our system is one in a series of systems in which we compare an approach
    using expert-defined rules with a comparable one using machine learning. We target
    tasks with a syntactic or semantic component that might be better described by
    a human understanding the task than by a machine learner only able to count features.
    For Semeval-2019 Task 9, the expert rules clearly outperformed our machine learning
    model when training and testing on equally balanced testsets.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our system, Joint Encoders for Stable Suggestion
    Inference (JESSI), for the SemEval 2019 Task 9: Suggestion Mining from Online
    Reviews and Forums. JESSI is a combination of two sentence encoders: (a) one using
    multiple pre-trained word embeddings learned from log-bilinear regression (GloVe)
    and translation (CoVe) models, and (b) one on top of word encodings from a pre-trained
    deep bidirectional transformer (BERT). We include a domain adversarial training
    module when training for out-of-domain samples. Our experiments show that while
    BERT performs exceptionally well for in-domain samples, several runs of the model
    show that it is unstable for out-of-domain samples. The problem is mitigated tremendously
    by (1) combining BERT with a non-BERT encoder, and (2) using an RNN-based classifier
    on top of BERT. Our final models obtained second place with 77.78% F-Score on
    Subtask A (i.e. in-domain) and achieved an F-Score of 79.59% on Subtask B (i.e.
    out-of-domain), even without using any additional external data.'

  abstract: Suggestion mining task aims to extract tips, advice, and recommendations
    from unstructured text. The task includes many challenges, such as class imbalance,
    figurative expressions, context dependency, and long and complex sentences. This
    paper gives a detailed system description of our submission in SemEval 2019 Task
    9 Subtask A. We transfer Self-Attention Network (SAN), a successful model in machine
    reading comprehension field, into this task. Our model concentrates on modeling
    long-term dependency which is indispensable to parse long and complex sentences.
    Besides, we also adopt techniques, such as contextualized embedding, back-translation,
    and auxiliary loss, to augment the system. Our model achieves a performance of
    F1=76.3, and rank 4th among 34 participating systems. Further ablation study shows
    that the techniques used in our system are beneficial to the performance.

  abstract: Consumer opinions towards commercial entities are generally expressed
    through online reviews, blogs, and discussion forums. These opinions largely express
    positive and negative sentiments towards a given entity,but also tend to contain
    suggestions for improving the entity. In this task, we extract suggestions from
    given the unstructured text, compared to the traditional opinion mining systems.
    Such suggestion mining is more applicability and extends capabilities.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission for the SemEval-2019 Suggestion Mining
    task. A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier with contextual word
    representations from a pre-trained language model was used for sentence classification.
    The model is trained using tri-training, a semi-supervised bootstrapping mechanism
    for labelling unseen data. Tri-training proved to be an effective technique to
    accommodate domain shift for cross-domain suggestion mining (Subtask B) where
    there is no hand labelled training data. For in-domain evaluation (Subtask A),
    we use the same technique to augment the training set. Our system ranks thirteenth
    in Subtask A with an F1-score of 68.07 and third in Subtask B with an F1-score
    of 81.94.

    Engineering, Tsinghua University Toponym resolution is an important and challenging
    task in the neural language processing field, and has wide applications such as
    emergency response and social media geographical event analysis. Toponym resolution
    can be roughly divided into two independent steps, i.e., toponym detection and
    toponym disambiguation. In order to facilitate the study on toponym resolution,
    the SemEval 2019 task 12 is proposed, which contains three subtasks, i.e., toponym
    detection, toponym disambiguation and toponym resolution. In this paper, we introduce
    our system that participated in the SemEval 2019 task 12. For toponym detection,
    in our approach we use TagLM as the basic model, and explore the use of various
    features in this task, such as word embeddings extracted from pre-trained language
    models, POS tags and lexical features extracted from dictionaries. For toponym
    disambiguation, we propose a heuristics rule-based method using toponym frequency
    and population. Our systems achieved 83.03% strict macro F1, 74.50 strict micro
    F1, 85.92 overlap macro F1 and 78.47 overlap micro F1 in toponym detection subtask.'

    used by the University of Arizona team (UArizona) for the SemEval 2019 task 12.
    We achieved fourth place on tasks 1 and 3. We implemented a deep-affix based LSTM-CRF
    NER model for task 1, which utilizes only character, word, pre- fix and suffix
    information for the identification of geolocation entities. Despite using just
    the training data provided by task organizers and not using any lexicon features,
    we achieved 78.85% strict micro F-score on task 1. We used the unsupervised population
    heuristics for task 3 and achieved 52.99% strict micro-F1 score in this task.
