  abstract: "Using the Entropy Reduction incremental complexity metric, we relate\
    \ high gamma power signals from the brains of epileptic patients to incremental\
    \ stages of syntactic analysis in English and French. We find that signals recorded\
    \ intracranially from the anterior Inferior Temporal Sulcus (aITS) and the posterior\
    \ Inferior Temporal Gyrus (pITG) correlate with word-by-word Entropy Reduction\
    \ values derived from phrase structure grammars for those languages. In the anterior\
    \ region, this correlation persists even in combination with surprisal co-predictors\
    \ from PCFG and ngram models. The result confirms the idea that the brain\u2019\
    s temporal lobe houses a parsing function, one whose incremental processing difficulty\
    \ profile reflects changes in grammatical uncertainty."

  abstract: "How do children learn a verb\u2019s argument structure when their input\
    \ contains nonbasic clauses that obscure verb transitivity? Here we present a\
    \ new model that infers verb transitivity by learning to filter out non-basic\
    \ clauses that were likely parsed in error. In simulations with child-directed\
    \ speech, we show that this model accurately categorizes the majority of 50 frequent\
    \ transitive, intransitive and alternating verbs, and jointly learns appropriate\
    \ parameters for filtering parsing errors. Our model is thus able to filter out\
    \ problematic data for verb learning without knowing in advance which data need\
    \ to be filtered."

  abstract: An important predictor of historical sound change, functional load, fails
    to capture insights from speech perception. Building on ideal observer models
    of word recognition, we devise a new definition of functional load that incorporates
    both a priori predictability and perceptual information. We explore this new measure
    with a simple model and find that it outperforms traditional measures.

  abstract: "Human listeners are able to quickly and robustly adapt to new accents\
    \ and do so by using information about speaker\u2019s identities. This paper will\
    \ present experimental evidence that, even considering information about speaker\u2019\
    s identities, listeners retain a strong bias towards the acoustics of their own\
    \ dialect after dialect learning. Participants\u2019 behaviour was accurately\
    \ mimicked by a classifier which was trained on more cases from the base dialect\
    \ and fewer from the target dialect. This suggests that imbalanced training data\
    \ may result in automatic speech recognition errors consistent with those of speakers\
    \ from populations over-represented in the training data."

  abstract: A recurrent neural network model of phonological pattern learning is proposed.
    The model is a relatively simple neural network with one recurrent layer, and
    displays biases in learning that mimic observed biases in human learning. Single-feature
    patterns are learned faster than two-feature patterns, and vowel or consonant-only
    patterns are learned faster than patterns involving vowels and consonants, mimicking
    the results of laboratory learning experiments. In non-recurrent models, capturing
    these biases requires the use of alpha features or some other representation of
    repeated features, but with a recurrent neural network, these elaborations are
    not necessary.

  abstract: Japanese speakers have a choice between canonical SOV and scrambled OSV
    word order to express the same meaning. Although previous experiments examine
    the influence of one or two factors for scrambling in a controlled setting, it
    is not yet known what kinds of multiple effects contribute to scrambling. This
    study uses naturally distributed data to test the multiple effects on scrambling
    simultaneously. A regression analysis replicates the NP length effect and suggests
    the influence of noun types, but it provides no evidence for syntactic priming,
    given-new ordering, and the animacy effect. These findings only show evidence
    for sentence-internal factors, but we find no evidence that discourse level factors
    play a role.

  abstract: "We here examine how different perspectives of understanding written discourse,\
    \ like the reader\u2019s, the writer\u2019s or the text\u2019s point of view,\
    \ affect the quality of emotion annotations. We conducted a series of annotation\
    \ experiments on two corpora, a popular movie review corpus and a genre- and domain-balanced\
    \ corpus of standard English. We found statistical evidence that the writer\u2019\
    s perspective yields superior annotation quality overall. However, the quality\
    \ one perspective yields compared to the other(s) seems to depend on the domain\
    \ the utterance originates from. Our data further suggest that the popular movie\
    \ review data set suffers from an atypical bimodal distribution which may decrease\
    \ model performance when used as a training resource."

  abstract: 'Traditional discourse annotation tasks are considered costly and time-consuming,
    and the reliability and validity of these tasks is in question. In this paper,
    we investigate whether crowdsourcing can be used to obtain reliable discourse
    relation annotations. We also examine the influence of context on the reliability
    of the data. The results of a crowdsourced connective insertion task showed that
    the method can be used to obtain reliable annotations: The majority of the inserted
    connectives converged with the original label. Further, the method is sensitive
    to the fact that multiple senses can often be inferred for a single relation.
    Regarding the presence of context, the results show no significant difference
    in distributions of insertions between conditions overall. However, a by-item
    comparison revealed several characteristics of segments that determine whether
    the presence of context makes a difference in annotations. The findings discussed
    in this paper can be taken as evidence that crowdsourcing can be used as a valuable
    method to obtain insights into the sense(s) of relations.'

  abstract: We present a code-switching corpus of Turkish-German that is collected
    by recording conversations of bilinguals. The recordings are then transcribed
    in two layers following speech and orthography conventions, and annotated with
    sentence boundaries and intersentential, intrasentential, and intra-word switch
    points. The total amount of data is 5 hours of speech which corresponds to 3614
    sentences. The corpus aims at serving as a resource for speech or text analysis,
    as well as a collection for linguistic inquiries.

  abstract: "We focus on the identification of omission in statement pairs. We compare\
    \ three annotation schemes, namely two different crowdsourcing schemes and manual\
    \ expert annotation. We show that the simplest of the two crowdsourcing approaches\
    \ yields a better annotation quality than the more complex one. We use a dedicated\
    \ classifier to assess whether the annotators\u2019 behavior can be explained\
    \ by straightforward linguistic features. The classifier benefits from a modeling\
    \ that uses lexical information beyond length and overlap measures. However, for\

  abstract: "Consistency is a crucial requirement in text annotation. It is especially\
    \ important in educational applications, as lack of consistency directly affects\
    \ learners\u2019 motivation and learning performance. This paper presents a quality\
    \ assessment scheme for English-to-Japanese translations produced by learner translators\
    \ at university. We constructed a revision typology and a decision tree manually\
    \ through an application of the OntoNotes method, i.e., an iteration of assessing\
    \ learners\u2019 translations and hypothesizing the conditions for consistent\
    \ decision making, as well as re-organizing the typology. Intrinsic evaluation\
    \ of the created scheme confirmed its potential contribution to the consistent\
    \ classification of identified erroneous text spans, achieving visibly higher\
    \ Cohen\u2019s kappa values, up to 0.831, than previous work. This paper also\
    \ describes an application of our scheme to an English-to-Japanese translation\
    \ exercise course for undergraduate students at a university in Japan."

  abstract: "For decades, most self-respecting linguistic engineering initiatives\
    \ have designed and implemented custom representations for various layers of,\
    \ for example, morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis. Despite occasional\
    \ efforts at harmonization or even standardization, our field today is blessed\
    \ with a multitude of ways of encoding and exchanging linguistic annotations of\
    \ these types, both at the levels of \u2018abstract syntax\u2019, naming choices,\
    \ and of course file formats. To a large degree, it is possible to work within\
    \ and across design plurality by conversion, and often there may be good reasons\
    \ for divergent design reflecting differences in use. However, it is likely that\
    \ some abstract commonalities across choices of representation are obscured by\
    \ more superficial differences, and conversely there is no obvious procedure to\
    \ tease apart what actually constitute contentful vs. mere technical divergences.\
    \ In this study, we seek to conceptually align three representations for common\
    \ types of morpho-syntactic analysis, pinpoint what in our view constitute contentful\
    \ differences, and reflect on the underlying principles and specific requirements\
    \ that led to individual choices. We expect that a more in-depth understanding\
    \ of these choices across designs may led to increased harmonization, or at least\
    \ to more informed design of future representations."

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our preliminary study on annotating event mention
    as a part of our research on high-precision news event extraction models. To this
    end, we propose a two-layer annotation scheme, designed to separately capture
    the functional and conceptual aspects of event mentions. We hypothesize that the
    precision of models can be improved by modeling and extracting separately the
    different aspects of news events, and then combining the extracted information
    by leveraging the complementarities of the models. In addition, we carry out a
    preliminary annotation using the proposed scheme and analyze the annotation quality
    in terms of inter-annotator agreement.

  abstract: With the advent of word representations, word similarity tasks are becoming
    increasing popular as an evaluation metric for the quality of the representations.
    In this paper, we present manually annotated monolingual word similarity datasets
    of six Indian languages - Urdu, Telugu, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Gujarati.
    These languages are most spoken Indian languages worldwide after Hindi and Bengali.
    For the construction of these datasets, our approach relies on translation and

  abstract: Language of cause and effect captures an essential component of the semantics
    of a text. However, causal language is also intertwined with other semantic relations,
    such as temporal precedence and correlation. This makes it difficult to determine
    when causation is the primary intended meaning. This paper presents BECauSE 2.0,
    a new version of the BECauSE corpus with exhaustively annotated expressions of
    causal language, but also seven semantic relations that are frequently co-present
    with causation. The new corpus shows high inter-annotator agreement, and yields
    insights both about the linguistic expressions of causation and about the process
    of annotating co-present semantic relations.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a simple, yet effective method for the automatic
    identification and extraction of causal relations from text, based on a large
    English-German parallel corpus. The goal of this effort is to create a lexical
    resource for German causal relations. The resource will consist of a lexicon that
    describes constructions that trigger causality as well as the participants of
    the causal event, and will be augmented by a corpus with annotated instances for
    each entry, that can be used as training data to develop a system for automatic
    classification of causal relations. Focusing on verbs, our method harvested a
    set of 100 different lexical triggers of causality, including support verb constructions.
    At the moment, our corpus includes over 1,000 annotated instances. The lexicon
    and the annotated data will be made available to the research community.

  abstract: We present the first experiment-based study that explicitly contrasts
    the three major semantic role labeling frameworks. As a prerequisite, we create
    a dataset labeled with parallel FrameNet-, PropBank-, and VerbNet-style labels
    for German. We train a state-of-the-art SRL tool for German for the different
    annotation styles and provide a comparative analysis across frameworks. We further
    explore the behavior of the frameworks with automatic training data generation.
    VerbNet provides larger semantic expressivity than PropBank, and we find that
    its generalization capacity approaches PropBank in SRL training, but it benefits
    less from training data expansion than the sparse-data affected FrameNet.

  abstract: We present a semi-supervised clustering approach to induce script structure
    from crowdsourced descriptions of event sequences by grouping event descriptions
    into paraphrase sets (representing event types) and inducing their temporal order.
    Our approach exploits semantic and positional similarity and allows for flexible
    event order, thus overcoming the rigidity of previous approaches. We incorporate
    crowdsourced alignments as prior knowledge and show that exploiting a small number
    of alignments results in a substantial improvement in cluster quality over state-of-the-art
    models and provides an appropriate basis for the induction of temporal order.
    We also show a coverage study to demonstrate the scalability of our approach.

  abstract: We propose to move from Open Information Extraction (OIE) ahead to Open
    Knowledge Representation (OKR), aiming to represent information conveyed jointly
    in a set of texts in an open text-based manner. We do so by consolidating OIE
    extractions using entity and predicate coreference, while modeling information
    containment between coreferring elements via lexical entailment. We suggest that
    generating OKR structures can be a useful step in the NLP pipeline, to give semantic
    applications an easy handle on consolidated information across multiple texts.

  abstract: Causal relations play a key role in information extraction and reasoning.
    Most of the times, their expression is ambiguous or implicit, i.e. without signals
    in the text. This makes their identification challenging. We aim to improve their
    identification by implementing a Feedforward Neural Network with a novel set of
    features for this task. In particular, these are based on the position of event
    mentions and the semantics of events and participants. The resulting classifier
    outperforms strong baselines on two datasets (the Penn Discourse Treebank and
    the CSTNews corpus) annotated with different schemes and containing examples in
    two languages, English and Portuguese. This result demonstrates the importance
    of events for identifying discourse relations.

  abstract: The Story Cloze test is a recent effort in providing a common test scenario
    for text understanding systems. As part of the LSDSem 2017 shared task, we present
    a system based on a deep learning architecture combined with a rich set of manually-crafted
    linguistic features. The system outperforms all known baselines for the task,
    suggesting that the chosen approach is promising. We additionally present two
    methods for generating further training data based on stories from the ROCStories
    corpus.

  abstract: We present a resource-lean neural recognizer for modeling coherence in
    commonsense stories. Our lightweight system is inspired by successful attempts
    to modeling discourse relations and stands out due to its simplicity and easy
    optimization compared to prior approaches to narrative script learning. We evaluate
    our approach in the Story Cloze Test demonstrating an absolute improvement in
    accuracy of 4.7% over state-of-the-art implementations.

  abstract: The Story Cloze Test consists of choosing a sentence that best completes
    a story given two choices. In this paper we present a system that performs this
    task using a supervised binary classifier on top of a recurrent neural network
    to predict the probability that a given story ending is correct. The classifier
    is trained to distinguish correct story endings given in the training data from
    incorrect ones that we artificially generate. Our experiments evaluate different
    methods for generating these negative examples, as well as different embedding-based
    representations of the stories. Our best result obtains 67.2% accuracy on the
    test set, outperforming the existing top baseline of 58.5%.

  abstract: This paper describes an ensemble system submitted as part of the LSDSem
    Shared Task 2017 - the Story Cloze Test. The main conclusion from our results
    is that an approach based on semantic similarity alone may not be enough for this
    task. We test various approaches and compare them with two ensemble systems. One
    is based on voting and the other on logistic regression based classifier. Our
    final system is able to outperform the previous state of the art for the Story
    Cloze test. Another very interesting observation is the performance of sentiment
    based approach which works almost as well on its own as our final ensemble system.

  abstract: This paper describes two supervised baseline systems for the Story Cloze
    Test Shared Task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a). We first build a classifier using
    features based on word embeddings and semantic similarity computation. We further
    implement a neural LSTM system with different encoding strategies that try to
    model the relation between the story and the provided endings. Our experiments
    show that a model using representation features based on average word embedding
    vectors over the given story words and the candidate ending sentences words, joint
    with similarity features between the story and candidate ending representations
    performed better than the neural models. Our best model based on achieves an accuracy
    of 72.42, ranking 3rd in the official evaluation.

  abstract: "Abstractive document summarization seeks to automatically generate a\
    \ summary for a document, based on some abstract \u201Cunderstanding\u201D of\
    \ the original document. State-of-the-art techniques traditionally use attentive\
    \ encoder\u2013decoder architectures. However, due to the large number of parameters\
    \ in these models, they require large training datasets and long training times.\
    \ In this paper, we propose decoupling the encoder and decoder networks, and training\
    \ them separately. We encode documents using an unsupervised document encoder,\
    \ and then feed the document vector to a recurrent neural network decoder. With\
    \ this decoupled architecture, we decrease the number of parameters in the decoder\
    \ substantially, and shorten its training time. Experiments show that the decoupled\
    \ model achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art models for in-domain\
    \ documents, but less well for out-of-domain documents."

  abstract: The textual similarity is a crucial aspect for many extractive text summarization
    methods. A bag-of-words representation does not allow to grasp the semantic relationships
    between concepts when comparing strongly related sentences with no words in common.
    To overcome this issue, in this paper we propose a centroid-based method for text
    summarization that exploits the compositional capabilities of word embeddings.
    The evaluations on multi-document and multilingual datasets prove the effectiveness
    of the continuous vector representation of words compared to the bag-of-words
    model. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves good performance even in comparison
    to more complex deep learning models. Our method is unsupervised and it can be
    adopted in other summarization tasks.

  abstract: Query-based text summarization is aimed at extracting essential information
    that answers the query from original text. The answer is presented in a minimal,
    often predefined, number of words. In this paper we introduce a new unsupervised
    approach for query-based extractive summarization, based on the minimum description
    length (MDL) principle that employs Krimp compression algorithm (Vreeken et al.,
    2011). The key idea of our approach is to select frequent word sets related to
    a given query that compress document sentences better and therefore describe the
    document better. A summary is extracted by selecting sentences that best cover
    query-related frequent word sets. The approach is evaluated based on the DUC 2005
    and DUC 2006 datasets which are specifically designed for query-based summarization
    (DUC, 2005 2006). It competes with the best results.

  abstract: Multiple grammatical and semantic features are adopted in content linking
    and argument/sentiment labeling for online forums in this paper. There are mainly
    two different methods for content linking. First, we utilize the deep feature
    obtained from Word Embedding Model in deep learning and compute sentence similarity.
    Second, we use multiple traditional features to locate candidate linking sentences,
    and then adopt a voting method to obtain the final result. LDA topic modeling
    is used to mine latent semantic feature and K-means clustering is implemented
    for argument labeling, while features from sentiment dictionaries and rule-based
    sentiment analysis are integrated for sentiment labeling. Experimental results
    have shown that our methods are valid.

  abstract: 'The electronic Word of Mouth has become the most powerful communication
    channel thanks to the wide usage of the Social Media. Our research proposes an
    approach towards the production of automatic ultra-concise summaries from multiple
    Web 2.0 sources. We exploit user-generated content from reviews and microblogs
    in different domains, and compile and analyse four types of ultra-concise summaries:
    a)positive information, b) negative information; c) both or d) objective information.
    The appropriateness and usefulness of our model is demonstrated by its successful
    results and great potential in real-life applications, thus meaning a relevant
    advancement of the state-of-the-art approaches.'

    \ method. This method relies on machine learning approach which operates by combining\
    \ multiple features to build models that predict the human score (overall responsiveness)\
    \ of a new summary. We have tried several single and \u201Censemble learning\u201D\
    \ classifiers to build the best model. We have experimented our method in summary\

  abstract: This paper presents a survey on hate speech detection. Given the steadily
    growing body of social media content, the amount of online hate speech is also
    increasing. Due to the massive scale of the web, methods that automatically detect
    hate speech are required. Our survey describes key areas that have been explored
    to automatically recognize these types of utterances using natural language processing.
    We also discuss limits of those approaches.

  abstract: "Emojis are used frequently in social media. A widely assumed view is\
    \ that emojis express the emotional state of the user, which has led to research\
    \ focusing on the expressiveness of emojis independent from the linguistic context.\
    \ We argue that emojis and the linguistic texts can modify the meaning of each\
    \ other. The overall communicated meaning is not a simple sum of the two channels.\
    \ In order to study the meaning interplay, we need data indicating the overall\
    \ sentiment of the entire message as well as the sentiment of the emojis stand-alone.\
    \ We propose that Facebook Reactions are a good data source for such a purpose.\
    \ FB reactions (e.g. \u201CLove\u201D and \u201CAngry\u201D) indicate the readers\u2019\
    \ overall sentiment, against which we can investigate the types of emojis used\
    \ the comments under different reaction profiles. We present a data set of 21,000\
    \ FB posts (57 million reactions and 8 million comments) from public media pages\
    \ across four countries."

  abstract: In this paper we investigate the cross-domain performance of a current
    state-of-the-art sentiment analysis systems. For this purpose we train a convolutional
    neural network (CNN) on data from different domains and evaluate its performance
    on other domains. Furthermore, we evaluate the usefulness of combining a large
    amount of different smaller annotated corpora to a large corpus. Our results show
    that more sophisticated approaches are required to train a system that works equally
    well on various domains.

  abstract: 'This paper presents new models that automatically align online aliases
    with their real entity names. Many research applications rely on identifying entity
    names in text, but people often refer to entities with unexpected nicknames and
    aliases. For example, The King and King James are aliases for Lebron James, a
    professional basketball player. Recent work on entity linking attempts to resolve
    mentions to knowledge base entries, like a wikipedia page, but linking is unfortunately
    limited to well-known entities with pre-built pages. This paper asks a more basic
    question: can aliases be aligned without background knowledge of the entity? Further,
    can the semantics surrounding alias mentions be used to inform alignments? We
    describe statistical models that make decisions based on the lexicographic properties
    of the aliases with their semantic context in a large corpus of tweets. We experiment
    on a database of Twitter users and their usernames, and present the first human
    evaluation for this task. Alignment accuracy approaches human performance at 81%,
    and we show that while lexicographic features are most important, the semantic
    context of an alias further improves classification accuracy.'

  abstract: In the last few years, microblogging platforms such as Twitter have given
    rise to a deluge of textual data that can be used for the analysis of informal
    communication between millions of individuals. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic
    approach to geographic language variation using a corpus based on Twitter. We
    test our models with tens of concepts and their associated keywords detected in
    Spanish tweets geolocated in Spain. We employ dialectometric measures (cosine
    similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence) to quantify the linguistic distance
    on the lexical level between cells created in a uniform grid over the map. This
    can be done for a single concept or in the general case taking into account an
    average of the considered variants. The latter permits an analysis of the dialects
    that naturally emerge from the data. Interestingly, our results reveal the existence
    of two dialect macrovarieties. The first group includes a region-specific speech
    spoken in small towns and rural areas whereas the second cluster encompasses cities
    that tend to use a more uniform variety. Since the results obtained with the two
    different metrics qualitatively agree, our work suggests that social media corpora
    can be efficiently used for dialectometric analyses.

  abstract: This paper presents a computational analysis of Gondi dialects spoken
    in central India. We present a digitized data set of the dialect area, and analyze
    the data using different techniques from dialectometry, deep learning, and computational
    biology. We show that the methods largely agree with each other and with the earlier
    non-computational analyses of the language group.

  abstract: This paper investigates diatopic variation in a historical corpus of German.
    Based on equivalent word forms from different language areas, replacement rules
    and mappings are derived which describe the relations between these word forms.
    These rules and mappings are then interpreted as reflections of morphological,
    phonological or graphemic variation. Based on sample rules and mappings, we show
    that our approach can replicate results from historical linguistics. While previous
    studies were restricted to predefined word lists, or confined to single authors
    or texts, our approach uses a much wider range of data available in historical
    corpora.

    \ attitude towards the two varieties does not have an impact on their intelligibility.\

  abstract: Catalan and Spanish are two related languages given that both derive from
    Latin. They share similarities in several linguistic levels including morphology,
    syntax and semantics. This makes them particularly interesting for the MT task.
    Given the recent appearance and popularity of neural MT, this paper analyzes the
    performance of this new approach compared to the well-established rule-based and
    phrase-based MT systems. Experiments are reported on a large database of 180 million
    words. Results, in terms of standard automatic measures, show that neural MT clearly
    outperforms the rule-based and phrase-based MT system on in-domain test set, but
    it is worst in the out-of-domain test set. A naive system combination specially
    works for the latter. In-domain manual analysis shows that neural MT tends to
    improve both adequacy and fluency, for example, by being able to generate more
    natural translations instead of literal ones, choosing to the adequate target
    word when the source word has several translations and improving gender agreement.
    However, out-of-domain manual analysis shows how neural MT is more affected by
    unknown words or contexts.

  abstract: This research suggests a method for machine translation among two Kurdish
    dialects. We chose the two widely spoken dialects, Kurmanji and Sorani, which
    are considered to be mutually unintelligible. Also, despite being spoken by about
    30 million people in different countries, Kurdish is among less-resourced languages.
    The research used bi-dialectal dictionaries and showed that the lack of parallel
    corpora is not a major obstacle in machine translation between the two dialects.
    The experiments showed that the machine translated texts are comprehensible to
    those who do not speak the dialect. The research is the first attempt for inter-dialect
    machine translation in Kurdish and particularly could help in making online texts
    in one dialect comprehensible to those who only speak the target dialect. The
    results showed that the translated texts are in 71% and 79% cases rated as understandable
    for Kurmanji and Sorani respectively. They are rated as slightly-understandable
    in 29% cases for Kurmanji and 21% for Sorani.

  abstract: We present a new method to bootstrap filter Twitter language ID labels
    in our dataset for automatic language identification (LID). Our method combines
    geo-location, original Twitter LID labels, and Amazon Mechanical Turk to resolve
    missing and unreliable labels. We are the first to compare LID classification
    performance using the MIRA algorithm and langid.py. We show classifier performance
    on different versions of our dataset with high accuracy using only Twitter data,
    without ground truth, and very few training examples. We also show how Platt Scaling
    can be use to calibrate MIRA classifier output values into a probability distribution
    over candidate classes, making the output more intuitive. Our method allows for
    fine-grained distinctions between similar languages and dialects and allows us
    to rediscover the language composition of our Twitter dataset.

  abstract: This paper deals with the development of morphosyntactic taggers for spoken
    varieties of the Slavic minority language Rusyn. As neither annotated corpora
    nor parallel corpora are electronically available for Rusyn, we propose to combine
    existing resources from the etymologically close Slavic languages Russian, Ukrainian,
    Slovak, and Polish and adapt them to Rusyn. Using MarMoT as tagging toolkit, we
    show that a tagger trained on a balanced set of the four source languages outperforms
    single language taggers by about 9%, and that additional automatically induced
    morphosyntactic lexicons lead to further improvements. The best observed accuracies
    for Rusyn are 82.4% for part-of-speech tagging and 75.5% for full morphological
    tagging.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the non-linear mappings we used with the Helsinki
    language identification method, HeLI, in the 4th edition of the Discriminating
    between Similar Languages (DSL) shared task, which was organized as part of the
    VarDial 2017 workshop. Our SUKI team participated on the closed track together
    with 10 other teams. Our system reached the 7th position in the track. We describe
    the HeLI method and the non-linear mappings in mathematical notation. The HeLI
    method uses a probabilistic model with character n-grams and word-based backoff.
    We also describe our trials using the non-linear mappings instead of relative
    frequencies and we present statistics about the back-off function of the HeLI
    method.

    very competitive model with reasonable results in the tasks we have participated.

  abstract: This paper describes the system developed by the Centre for English Corpus
    Linguistics (CECL) to discriminating similar languages, language varieties and
    dialects. Based on a SVM with character and POStag n-grams as features and the
    BM25 weighting scheme, it achieved 92.7% accuracy in the Discriminating between
    Similar Languages (DSL) task, ranking first among eleven systems but with a lead
    over the next three teams of only 0.2%. A simpler version of the system ranked
    second in the German Dialect Identification (GDI) task thanks to several ad hoc
    postprocessing steps. Complementary analyses carried out by a cross-validation
    procedure suggest that the BM25 weighting scheme could be competitive in this
    type of tasks, at least in comparison with the sublinear TF-IDF. POStag n-grams
    also improved the system performance.

  abstract: Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) is a challenging task addressed
    at the VarDial Workshop series. We report on our participation in the DSL shared
    task with a two-stage system. In the first stage, character n-grams are used to
    separate language groups, then specialized classifiers distinguish similar language
    varieties. We have conducted experiments with three system configurations and
    submitted one run for each. Our main approach is a word-level convolutional neural
    network (CNN) that learns task-specific vectors with minimal text preprocessing.
    We also experiment with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks and another hybrid
    configuration. Our best run achieved an accuracy of 90.76%, ranking 8th among
    11 participants and getting very close to the system that ranked first (less than
    2 points). Even though the CNN model could not achieve the best results, it still
    makes a viable approach to discriminating between similar languages.

  abstract: This paper describes the submission from the University of Helsinki to
    the shared task on cross-lingual dependency parsing at VarDial 2017. We present
    work on annotation projection and treebank translation that gave good results
    for all three target languages in the test set. In particular, Slovak seems to
    work well with information coming from the Czech treebank, which is in line with
    related work. The attachment scores for cross-lingual models even surpass the
    fully supervised models trained on the target language treebank. Croatian is the
    most difficult language in the test set and the improvements over the baseline
    are rather modest. Norwegian works best with information coming from Swedish whereas
    Danish contributes surprisingly little.

  abstract: This paper describes our systems and results on VarDial 2017 shared tasks.
    Besides three language/dialect discrimination tasks, we also participated in the
    cross-lingual dependency parsing (CLP) task using a simple methodology which we
    also briefly describe in this paper. For all the discrimination tasks, we used
    linear SVMs with character and word features. The system achieves competitive
    results among other systems in the shared task. We also report additional experiments
    with neural network models. The performance of neural network models was close
    but always below the corresponding SVM classifiers in the discrimination tasks.
    For the cross-lingual parsing task, we experimented with an approach based on
    automatically translating the source treebank to the target language, and training
    a parser on the translated treebank. We used off-the-shelf tools for both translation
    and parsing. Despite achieving better-than-baseline results, our scores in CLP
    tasks were substantially lower than the scores of the other participants.

    case. Our results confirm earlier findings: simple traditional models outperform
    neural networks consistently for this task, at least given the amount of systems

    Bayesian classifier. Meaningful bag-of-n-grams features can be used as a system
    in a straightforward way, my approach outperforms most of the systems used in
    the DSL shared task (3rd rank).'

  abstract: We present a method to discriminate between texts written in either the
    Netherlandic or the Flemish variant of the Dutch language. The method draws on
    a feature bundle representing text statistics, syntactic features, and word n-grams.
    Text statistics include average word length and sentence length, while syntactic
    features include ratios of function words and part-of-speech -grams. Text statistics
    include average word length and sentence length, while syntactic features include
    ratios of function words and part-of-speech n-grams. The effectiveness of the
    classifier was measured by classifying Dutch subtitles developed for either Dutch
    or Flemish television. Several machine learning algorithms were compared as well
    as feature combination methods in order to find the optimal generalization performance.
    A machine-learning meta classifier based on AdaBoost attained the best F-score
    of 0.92. -grams. The effectiveness of the classifier was measured by classifying

  abstract: We present a machine learning approach for the Arabic Dialect Identification
    (ADI) and the German Dialect Identification (GDI) Closed Shared Tasks of the DSL
    2017 Challenge. The proposed approach combines several kernels using multiple
    kernel learning. While most of our kernels are based on character p-grams (also
    known as n-grams) extracted from speech transcripts, we also use a kernel based
    on i-vectors, a low-dimensional representation of audio recordings, provided only
    for the Arabic data. In the learning stage, we independently employ Kernel Discriminant
    Analysis (KDA) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). Our approach is shallow and
    simple, but the empirical results obtained in the shared tasks prove that it achieves
    very good results. Indeed, we ranked on the first place in the ADI Shared Task
    with a weighted F1 score of 76.32% (4.62% above the second place) and on the fifth
    place in the GDI Shared Task with a weighted F1 score of 63.67% (2.57% below the
    first place).

  abstract: This paper presents a language identification system designed to detect
    the language of each word, in its context, in a multilingual documents as generated
    in social media by bilingual/multilingual communities, in our case speakers of
    Algerian Arabic. We frame the task as a sequence tagging problem and use supervised
    machine learning with standard methods like HMM and Ngram classification tagging.
    We also experiment with a lexicon-based method. Combining all the methods in a
    fall-back mechanism and introducing some linguistic rules, to deal with unseen
    tokens and ambiguous words, gives an overall accuracy of 93.14%. Finally, we introduced
    rules for language identification from sequences of recognised words.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a new and fast state-of-the-art Arabic diacritizer
    that guesses the diacritics of words and then their case endings. We employ a
    Viterbi decoder at word-level with back-off to stem, morphological patterns, and
    transliteration and sequence labeling based diacritization of named entities.
    For case endings, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) based ranking coupled with
    morphological patterns and linguistic rules to properly guess case endings. We
    achieve a low word level diacritization error of 3.29% and 12.77% without and
    with case endings respectively on a new multi-genre free of copyright test set.
    We are making the diacritizer available for free for research purposes.

  abstract: Semantic textual similarity is the basis of countless applications and
    plays an important role in diverse areas, such as information retrieval, plagiarism
    detection, information extraction and machine translation. This article proposes
    an innovative word embedding-based system devoted to calculate the semantic similarity
    in Arabic sentences. The main idea is to exploit vectors as word representations
    in a multidimensional space in order to capture the semantic and syntactic properties
    of words. IDF weighting and Part-of-Speech tagging are applied on the examined
    sentences to support the identification of words that are highly descriptive in
    each sentence. The performance of our proposed system is confirmed through the
    Pearson correlation between our assigned semantic similarity scores and human
    judgments.

  abstract: Maltese is a morphologically rich language with a hybrid morphological
    system which features both concatenative and non-concatenative processes. This
    paper analyses the impact of this hybridity on the performance of machine learning
    techniques for morphological labelling and clustering. In particular, we analyse
    a dataset of morphologically related word clusters to evaluate the difference
    in results for concatenative and non-concatenative clusters. We also describe
    research carried out in morphological labelling, with a particular focus on the
    verb category. Two evaluations were carried out, one using an unseen dataset,
    and another one using a gold standard dataset which was manually labelled. The
    gold standard dataset was split into concatenative and non-concatenative to analyse
    the difference in results between the two morphological systems.

  abstract: The automated processing of Arabic Dialects is challenging due to the
    lack of spelling standards and to the scarcity of annotated data and resources
    in general. Segmentation of words into its constituent parts is an important processing
    building block. In this paper, we show how a segmenter can be trained using only
    350 annotated tweets using neural networks without any normalization or use of
    lexical features or lexical resources. We deal with segmentation as a sequence
    labeling problem at the character level. We show experimentally that our model
    can rival state-of-the-art methods that rely on additional resources.

  abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) is significantly different from the Arabic language
    taught in schools and used in written communication and formal speech (broadcast
    news, religion, politics, etc.). There are many existing researches in the field
    of Arabic language Sentiment Analysis (SA); however, they are generally restricted
    to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or some dialects of economic or political interest.
    In this paper we are interested in the SA of the Tunisian Dialect. We utilize
    Machine Learning techniques to determine the polarity of comments written in Tunisian
    Dialect. First, we evaluate the SA systems performances with models trained using
    freely available MSA and Multi-dialectal data sets. We then collect and annotate
    a Tunisian Dialect corpus of 17.000 comments from Facebook. This corpus allows
    us a significant accuracy improvement compared to the best model trained on other
    Arabic dialects or MSA data. We believe that this first freely available corpus
    will be valuable to researchers working in the field of Tunisian Sentiment Analysis
    and similar areas.

  abstract: "Data generated on Twitter has become a rich source for various data mining\
    \ tasks. Those data analysis tasks that are dependent on the tweet semantics,\
    \ such as sentiment analysis, emotion mining, and rumor detection among others,\
    \ suffer considerably if the tweet is not credible, not real, or spam. In this\
    \ paper, we perform an extensive analysis on credibility of Arabic content on\
    \ Twitter. We also build a classification model (CAT) to automatically predict\
    \ the credibility of a given Arabic tweet. Of particular originality is the inclusion\
    \ of features extracted directly or indirectly from the author\u2019s profile\
    \ and timeline. To train and test CAT, we annotated for credibility a data set\
    \ of 9,000 Arabic tweets that are topic independent. CAT achieved consistent improvements\
    \ in predicting the credibility of the tweets when compared to several baselines\
    \ and when compared to the state-of-the-art approach with an improvement of 21%\
    \ in weighted average F-measure. We also conducted experiments to highlight the\
    \ importance of the user-based features as opposed to the content-based features.\
    \ We conclude our work with a feature reduction experiment that highlights the\
    \ best indicative features of credibility."

  abstract: This paper aims to develop a new classification of errors made in Arabic
    by those suffering from dyslexia to be used in the annotation of the Arabic dyslexia
    corpus (BDAC). The dyslexic error classification for Arabic texts (DECA) comprises
    a list of spelling errors extracted from previous studies and a collection of
    texts written by people with dyslexia that can provide a framework to help analyse
    specific errors committed by dyslexic writers. The classification comprises 37
    types of errors, grouped into nine categories. The paper also discusses building
    a corpus of dyslexic Arabic texts that uses the error annotation scheme and provides
    an analysis of the errors that were found in the texts.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce an enhancement for speech recognition systems
    using an unsupervised speaker clustering technique. The proposed technique is
    mainly based on I-vectors and Self-Organizing Map Neural Network(SOM).The input
    to the proposed algorithm is a set of speech utterances. For each utterance, we
    extract 100-dimensional I-vector and then SOM is used to group the utterances
    to different speakers. In our experiments, we compared our technique with Normalized
    Cross Likelihood ratio Clustering (NCLR). Results show that the proposed technique
    reduces the speaker error rate in comparison with NCLR. Finally, we have experimented
    the effect of speaker clustering on Speaker Adaptive Training (SAT) in a speech
    recognition system implemented to test the performance of the proposed technique.
    It was noted that the proposed technique reduced the WER over clustering speakers
    with NCLR.

  abstract: This paper sheds light on a system that would be able to diacritize Arabic
    texts automatically (SHAKKIL). In this system, the diacritization problem will
    be handled through two levels; morphological and syntactic processing levels.
    The adopted morphological disambiguation algorithm depends on four layers; Uni-morphological
    form layer, rule-based morphological disambiguation layer, statistical-based disambiguation
    layer and Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) layer. The adopted syntactic disambiguation
    algorithms is concerned with detecting the case ending diacritics depending on
    a rule based approach simulating the shallow parsing technique. This will be achieved
    using an annotated corpus for extracting the Arabic linguistic rules, building
    the language models and testing the system output. This system is considered as
    a good trial of the interaction between rule-based approach and statistical approach,
    where the rules can help the statistics in detecting the right diacritization
    and vice versa. At this point, the morphological Word Error Rate (WER) is 4.56%
    while the morphological Diacritic Error Rate (DER) is 1.88% and the syntactic
    WER is 9.36%. The best WER is 14.78% compared to the best-published results, of
    (Abandah, 2015); 11.68%, (Rashwan, et al., 2015); 12.90% and (Metwally, Rashwan,
    & Atiya, 2016); 13.70%.

    \ parser to create a larger treebank by using the small treebank as a seed training\
    \ set. We are able to create a dependency treebank from unlabelled tweets without\

  abstract: Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems are a valuable tool
    to enable speakers of one language to search for content of interest expressed
    in a different language. A group for whom this is of particular interest is bilingual
    Arabic speakers who wish to search for English language content using information
    needs expressed in Arabic queries. A key challenge in CLIR is crossing the language
    barrier between the query and the documents. The most common approach to bridging
    this gap is automated query translation, which can be unreliable for vague or
    short queries. In this work, we examine the potential for improving CLIR effectiveness
    by predicting the translation effectiveness using Query Performance Prediction
    (QPP) techniques. We propose a novel QPP method to estimate the quality of translation
    for an Arabic-English Cross-lingual User-generated Speech Search (CLUGS) task.
    We present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the quality of our method
    on alternative translation outputs extracted from an Arabic-to-English Machine
    Translation system developed for this task. Finally, we show how this framework
    can be integrated in CLUGS to find relevant translations for improved retrieval
    performance.

  abstract: "Opinion mining in Arabic is a challenging task given the rich morphology\
    \ of the language. The task becomes more challenging when it is applied to Twitter\
    \ data, which contains additional sources of noise, such as the use of unstandardized\
    \ dialectal variations, the nonconformation to grammatical rules, the use of Arabizi\
    \ and code-switching, and the use of non-text objects such as images and URLs\
    \ to express opinion. In this paper, we perform an analytical study to observe\
    \ how such linguistic phenomena vary across different Arab regions. This study\
    \ of Arabic Twitter characterization aims at providing better understanding of\
    \ Arabic Tweets, and fostering advanced research on the topic. Furthermore, we\
    \ explore the performance of the two schools of machine learning on Arabic Twitter,\
    \ namely the feature engineering approach and the deep learning approach. We consider\
    \ models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance for opinion mining in\
    \ English. Results highlight the advantages of using deep learning-based models,\
    \ and confirm the importance of using morphological abstractions to address Arabic\u2019\
    s complex morphology."

  abstract: This paper focuses on comparing between using Support Vector Machine based
    ranking (SVM-Rank) and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (bi-LSTM) neural-network
    based sequence labeling in building a state-of-the-art Arabic part-of-speech tagging
    system. Using SVM-Rank leads to state-of-the-art results, but with a fair amount
    of feature engineering. Using bi-LSTM, particularly when combined with word embeddings,
    may lead to competitive POS-tagging results by automatically deducing latent linguistic
    features. However, we show that augmenting bi-LSTM sequence labeling with some
    of the features that we used for the SVM-Rank based tagger yields to further improvements.
    We also show that gains that realized by using embeddings may not be additive
    with the gains achieved by the features. We are open-sourcing both the SVM-Rank
    and the bi-LSTM based systems for free.

  abstract: Although there is by now a considerable amount of research on subjectivity
    and sentiment analysis on morphologically-rich languages, it is still unclear
    how lexical information can best be modeled in these languages. To bridge this
    gap, we build effective models exploiting exclusively gold- and machine-segmented
    lexical input and successfully employ syntactically motivated feature selection
    to improve classification. Our best models achieve significantly above the baselines,
    with 67.93% and 69.37% accuracies for subjectivity and sentiment classification
    respectively.

  abstract: Automatic speech recognition for Arabic is a very challenging task. Despite
    all the classical techniques for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which can
    be efficiently applied to Arabic speech recognition, it is essential to take into
    consideration the language specificities to improve the system performance. In
    this article, we focus on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) speech recognition. We
    introduce the challenges related to Arabic language, namely the complex morphology
    nature of the language and the absence of the short vowels in written text, which
    leads to several potential vowelization for each graphemes, which is often conflicting.
    We develop an ASR system for MSA by using Kaldi toolkit. Several acoustic and
    language models are trained. We obtain a Word Error Rate (WER) of 14.42 for the
    baseline system and 12.2 relative improvement by rescoring the lattice and by
    rewriting the output with the right Z hamoza above or below Alif.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a system for automatic Arabic text diacritization
    using three levels of analysis granularity in a layered back off manner. We build
    and exploit diacritized language models (LM) for each of three different levels
    of granularity: surface form, morphologically segmented into prefix/stem/suffix,
    and character level. For each of the passes, we use Viterbi search to pick the
    most probable diacritization per word in the input. We start with the surface
    form LM, followed by the morphological level, then finally we leverage the character
    level LM. Our system outperforms all of the published systems evaluated against
    the same training and test data. It achieves a 10.87% WER for complete full diacritization
    including lexical and syntactic diacritization, and 3.0% WER for lexical diacritization,
    ignoring syntactic diacritization.'

  abstract: Determining the textual entailment between texts is important in many
    NLP tasks, such as summarization, question answering, and information extraction
    and retrieval. Various methods have been suggested based on external knowledge
    sources; however, such resources are not always available in all languages and
    their acquisition is typically laborious and very costly. Distributional word
    representations such as word embeddings learned over large corpora have been shown
    to capture syntactic and semantic word relationships. Such models have contributed
    to improving the performance of several NLP tasks. In this paper, we address the
    problem of textual entailment in Arabic. We employ both traditional features and
    distributional representations. Crucially, we do not depend on any external resources
    in the process. Our suggested approach yields state of the art performance on
    a standard data set, ArbTE, achieving an accuracy of 76.2 % compared to state
    of the art of 69.3 %.

  abstract: There is great variation in the amount of NLP resources available for
    Slavonic languages. For example, the Universal Dependency treebank (Nivre et al.,
    2016) has about 2 MW of training resources for Czech, more than 1 MW for Russian,
    while only 950 words for Ukrainian and nothing for Belorussian, Bosnian or Macedonian.
    Similarly, the Autodesk Machine Translation dataset only covers three Slavonic
    languages (Czech, Polish and Russian). In this talk I will discuss a general approach,
    which can be called Language Adaptation, similarly to Domain Adaptation. In this
    approach, a model for a particular language processing task is built by lexical
    transfer of cognate words and by learning a new feature representation for a lesser-resourced
    (recipient) language starting from a better-resourced (donor) language. More specifically,
    I will demonstrate how language adaptation works in such training scenarios as
    Translation Quality Estimation, Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition.

  abstract: Lexical substitution is a task of determining a meaning-preserving replacement
    for a word in context. We report on a preliminary study of this task for the Croatian
    language on a small-scale lexical sample dataset, manually annotated using three
    different annotation schemes. We compare the annotations, analyze the inter-annotator
    agreement, and observe a number of interesting language specific details in the
    obtained lexical substitutes. Furthermore, we apply a recently-proposed, dependency-based
    lexical substitution model to our dataset. The model achieves a P@3 score of 0.35,
    which indicates the difficulty of the task.

  abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) are linguistic objects containing two or
    more words and showing idiosyncratic behavior at different levels. Treebanks with
    annotated MWEs enable studies of such properties, as well as training and evaluation
    of MWE-aware parsers. However, few treebanks contain full-fledged MWE annotations.
    We show how this gap can be bridged in Polish by projecting 3 MWE resources on
    a constituency treebank.

  abstract: This paper reports on challenges and results in developing NLP resources
    for spoken Rusyn. Being a Slavic minority language, Rusyn does not have any resources
    to make use of. We propose to build a morphosyntactic dictionary for Rusyn, combining
    existing resources from the etymologically close Slavic languages Russian, Ukrainian,
    Slovak, and Polish. We adapt these resources to Rusyn by using vowel-sensitive
    Levenshtein distance, hand-written language-specific transformation rules, and
    combinations of the two. Compared to an exact match baseline, we increase the
    coverage of the resulting morphological dictionary by up to 77.4% relative (42.9%
    absolute), which results in a tagging recall increased by 11.6% relative (9.1%
    absolute). Our research confirms and expands the results of previous studies showing
    the efficiency of using NLP resources from neighboring languages for low-resourced
    languages.

  abstract: This paper introduces the Universal Dependencies Treebank for Slovenian.
    We overview the existing dependency treebanks for Slovenian and then detail the
    conversion of the ssj200k treebank to the framework of Universal Dependencies
    version 2. We explain the mapping of part-of-speech categories, morphosyntactic
    features, and the dependency relations, focusing on the more problematic language-specific
    issues. We conclude with a quantitative overview of the treebank and directions
    for further work.

  abstract: The paper documents the procedure of building a new Universal Dependencies
    (UDv2) treebank for Serbian starting from an existing Croatian UDv1 treebank and
    taking into account the other Slavic UD annotation guidelines. We describe the
    automatic and manual annotation procedures, discuss the annotation of Slavic-specific
    categories (case governing quantifiers, reflexive pronouns, question particles)
    and propose an approach to handling deverbal nouns in Slavic languages.

  abstract: We present an algorithm for automatic correction of spelling errors on
    the sentence level, which uses noisy channel model and feature-based reranking
    of hypotheses. Our system is designed for Russian and clearly outperforms the
    winner of SpellRuEval-2016 competition. We show that language model size has the
    greatest influence on spelling correction quality. We also experiment with different
    types of features and show that morphological and semantic information also improves
    the accuracy of spellchecking.

  abstract: Sentiment lexicons are widely used as an intuitive and inexpensive way
    of tackling sentiment classification, often within a simple lexicon word-counting
    approach or as part of a supervised model. However, it is an open question whether
    these approaches can compete with supervised models that use only word-representation
    features. We address this question in the context of domain-specific sentiment
    classification for Croatian. We experiment with the graph-based acquisition of
    sentiment lexicons, analyze their quality, and investigate how effectively they
    can be used in sentiment classification. Our results indicate that, even with
    as few as 500 labeled instances, a supervised model substantially outperforms
    a word-counting model. We also observe that adding lexicon-based features does
    not significantly improve supervised sentiment classification.

  abstract: In this paper we present the adaptations of a state-of-the-art tagger
    for South Slavic languages to non-standard texts on the example of the Slovene
    language. We investigate the impact of introducing in-domain training data as
    well as additional supervision through external resources or tools like word clusters
    and word normalization. We remove more than half of the error of the standard
    tagger when applied to non-standard texts by training it on a combination of standard
    and non-standard training data, while enriching the data representation with external
    resources removes additional 11 percent of the error. The final configuration
    achieves tagging accuracy of 87.41% on the full morphosyntactic description, which
    is, nevertheless, still quite far from the accuracy of 94.27% achieved on standard
    text.

  abstract: 'We focus on the task of supervised sentiment classification of short
    and informal texts in Croatian, using two simple yet effective methods: word embeddings
    and string kernels. We investigate whether word embeddings offer any advantage
    over corpus- and preprocessing-free string kernels, and how these compare to bag-of-words
    baselines. We conduct a comparison on three different datasets, using different
    preprocessing methods and kernel functions. Results show that, on two out of three

  abstract: This paper describes the outcomes of the first challenge on multilingual
    named entity recognition that aimed at recognizing mentions of named entities
    in web documents in Slavic languages, their normalization/lemmatization, and cross-language
    matching. It was organised in the context of the 6th Balto-Slavic Natural Language
    Processing Workshop, co-located with the EACL 2017 conference. Although eleven
    teams signed up for the evaluation, due to the complexity of the task(s) and short
    time available for elaborating a solution, only two teams submitted results on
    time. The reported evaluation figures reflect the relatively higher level of complexity
    of named entity-related tasks in the context of processing texts in Slavic languages.
    Since the duration of the challenge goes beyond the date of the publication of
    this paper and updated picture of the participating systems and their corresponding
    performance can be found on the web page of the challenge.

  abstract: Relation between gender and language has been studied by many authors,
    however, there is still some uncertainty left regarding gender influence on language
    usage in the professional environment. Often, the studied data sets are too small
    or texts of individual authors are too short in order to capture differences of
    language usage wrt gender successfully. This study draws from a larger corpus
    of speeches transcripts of the Lithuanian Parliament (1990-2013) to explore language
    differences of political debates by gender via stylometric analysis. Experimental
    set up consists of stylistic features that indicate lexical style and do not require
    external linguistic tools, namely the most frequent words, in combination with
    unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Results show that gender differences
    in the language use remain in professional environment not only in usage of function
    words, preferred linguistic constructions, but in the presented topics as well.

    algorithm extensions aimed to gather specificity of morphologicaly rich free-word-order
    language. We demonstrate that this method may be successfully applied to Russian
    data. In addition we perform several additional experiments comparing different
    settings of the training process. We demonstrate that utilizing of morphological
    features significantly improves the system precision while using of seed patterns
    helps to improve the coverage.

  abstract: We present results of the first gender classification experiments on Slovene
    text to our knowledge. Inspired by the TwiSty corpus and experiments (Verhoeven
    et al., 2016), we employed the Janes corpus (Erjavec et al., 2016) and its gender
    annotations to perform gender classification experiments on Twitter text comparing
    a token-based and a lemma-based approach. We find that the token-based approach
    (92.6% accuracy), containing gender markings related to the author, outperforms
    the lemma-based approach by about 5%. Especially in the lemmatized version, we
    also observe stylistic and content-based differences in writing between men (e.g.
    more profane language, numerals and beer mentions) and women (e.g. more pronouns,
    emoticons and character flooding). Many of our findings corroborate previous research
    on other languages.

  abstract: Only a year ago, all state-of-the-art coreference resolvers were using
    an extensive amount of surface features. Recently, there was a paradigm shift
    towards using word embeddings and deep neural networks, where the use of surface
    features is very limited. In this paper, we show that a simple SVM model with
    surface features outperforms more complex neural models for detecting anaphoric
    mentions. Our analysis suggests that using generalized representations and surface
    features have different strength that should be both taken into account for improving
    coreference resolution.

  abstract: 'This article presents the first collection of French Winograd Schemas.
    Winograd Schemas form anaphora resolution problems that can only be resolved with
    extensive world knowledge. For this reason the Winograd Schema Challenge has been
    proposed as an alternative to the Turing Test. A very important feature of Winograd
    Schemas is that it should be impossible to resolve them with statistical information
    about word co-occurrences: they should be Google-proof. We propose a measure of
    Google-proofness based on Mutual Information, and demonstrate the method on our
    collection of French Winograd Schemas.'

  abstract: In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of a coreference-aware
    decoder for document-level machine translation. We consider that better translations
    should have coreference links that are closer to those in the source text, and
    implement this criterion in two ways. First, we define a similarity measure between
    source and target coreference structures, by projecting the target ones onto the
    source and reusing existing coreference metrics. Based on this similarity measure,
    we re-rank the translation hypotheses of a baseline system for each sentence.
    Alternatively, to address the lack of diversity of mentions in the MT hypotheses,
    we focus on mention pairs and integrate their coreference scores with MT ones,
    resulting in post-editing decisions for mentions. The experimental results for
    Spanish to English MT on the AnCora-ES corpus show that the second approach yields
    a substantial increase in the accuracy of pronoun translation, with BLEU scores
    remaining constant.

  abstract: 'The CORBON 2017 Shared Task, organised as part of the Coreference Resolution
    Beyond OntoNotes workshop at EACL 2017, presented a new challenge for multilingual
    coreference resolution: we offer a projection-based setting in which one is supposed
    to build a coreference resolver for a new language exploiting little or even no
    knowledge of it, with our languages of interest being German and Russian. We additionally
    offer a more traditional setting, targeting the development of a multilingual
    coreference resolver without any restrictions on the resources and methods used.
    In this paper, we describe the task setting and provide the results of one participant
    who successfully completed the task, comparing their results to the closely related
    previous research. Analysing the task setting and the results, we discuss the
    major challenges and make suggestions on the future directions of coreference
    evaluation.'

  abstract: Researchers and practitioners in natural-language processing (NLP) and
    related fields should attend to ethical principles in study design, ascription
    of categories/variables to study participants, and reporting of findings or results.
    This paper discusses theoretical and ethical frameworks for using gender as a
    variable in NLP studies and proposes four guidelines for researchers and practitioners.
    The principles outlined here should guide practitioners, researchers, and peer
    reviewers, and they may be applicable to other social categories, such as race,
    applied to human beings connected to NLP research.

  abstract: Stylometric and text categorization results show that author gender can
    be discerned in texts with relatively high accuracy. However, it is difficult
    to explain what gives rise to these results and there are many possible confounding
    factors, such as the domain, genre, and target audience of a text. More fundamentally,
    such classification efforts risk invoking stereotyping and essentialism. We explore
    this issue in two datasets of Dutch literary novels, using commonly used descriptive
    (LIWC, topic modeling) and predictive (machine learning) methods. Our results
    show the importance of controlling for variables in the corpus and we argue for
    taking care not to overgeneralize from the results.

  abstract: We present results on a quantitative analysis of publications in the NLP
    domain on collecting, publishing and availability of research data. We find that
    a wide range of publications rely on data crawled from the web, but few give details
    on how potentially sensitive data was treated. Additionally, we find that while
    links to repositories of data are given, they often do not work even a short time
    after publication. We put together several suggestions on how to improve this
    situation based on publications from the NLP domain, but also other research areas.

  abstract: "Natural language processing (NLP) systems analyze and/or generate human\
    \ language, typically on users\u2019 behalf. One natural and necessary question\
    \ that needs to be addressed in this context, both in research projects and in\
    \ production settings, is the question how ethical the work is, both regarding\
    \ the process and its outcome. Towards this end, we articulate a set of issues,\
    \ propose a set of best practices, notably a process featuring an ethics review\
    \ board, and sketch and how they could be meaningfully applied. Our main argument\
    \ is that ethical outcomes ought to be achieved by design, i.e. by following a\
    \ process aligned by ethical values. We also offer some response options for those\
    \ facing ethics issues. While a number of previous works exist that discuss ethical\
    \ issues, in particular around big data and machine learning, to the authors\u2019\
    \ knowledge this is the first account of NLP and ethics from the perspective of\
    \ a principled process."

  abstract: "Automated scoring of written and spoken responses is an NLP application\
    \ that can significantly impact lives especially when deployed as part of high-stakes\
    \ tests such as the GRE\xAE and the TOEFL\xAE. Ethical considerations require\
    \ that automated scoring algorithms treat all test-takers fairly. The educational\
    \ measurement community has done significant research on fairness in assessments\
    \ and automated scoring systems must incorporate their recommendations. The best\
    \ way to do that is by making available automated, non-proprietary tools to NLP\
    \ researchers that directly incorporate these recommendations and generate the\
    \ analyses needed to help identify and resolve biases in their scoring systems.\
    \ In this paper, we attempt to provide such a solution."

    \ and gender was controlled for by using videos uploaded as part of the \u201C\

    \ background. The results show robust differences in accuracy across both gender\
    \ and dialect, with lower accuracy for 1) women and 2) speakers from Scotland.\
    \ This finding builds on earlier research finding that speaker\u2019s sociolinguistic\
    \ identity may negatively impact their ability to use automatic speech recognition,\
    \ and demonstrates the need for sociolinguistically-stratified validation of systems."

  abstract: Shared tasks are increasingly common in our field, and new challenges
    are suggested at almost every conference and workshop. However, as this has become
    an established way of pushing research forward, it is important to discuss how
    we researchers organise and participate in shared tasks, and make that information
    available to the community to allow further research improvements. In this paper,
    we present a number of ethical issues along with other areas of concern that are
    related to the competitive nature of shared tasks. As such issues could potentially
    impact on research ethics in the Natural Language Processing community, we also
    propose the development of a framework for the organisation of and participation
    in shared tasks that can help mitigate against these issues arising.

  abstract: Clinical NLP has an immense potential in contributing to how clinical
    practice will be revolutionized by the advent of large scale processing of clinical
    records. However, this potential has remained largely untapped due to slow progress
    primarily caused by strict data access policies for researchers. In this paper,
    we discuss the concern for privacy and the measures it entails. We also suggest
    sources of less sensitive data. Finally, we draw attention to biases that can
    compromise the validity of empirical research and lead to socially harmful applications.

  abstract: The argument made in this paper is that to act ethically in machine learning
    and NLP requires focusing on goals. NLP projects are often classificatory systems
    that deal with human subjects, which means that goals from people affected by
    the systems should be included. The paper takes as its core example a model that
    detects criminality, showing the problems of training data, categories, and outcomes.
    The paper is oriented to the kinds of critiques on power and the reproduction
    of inequality that are found in social theory, but it also includes concrete suggestions
    on how to put goal-oriented design into practice.

  abstract: Social media have transformed data-driven research in political science,
    the social sciences, health, and medicine. Since health research often touches
    on sensitive topics that relate to ethics of treatment and patient privacy, similar
    ethical considerations should be acknowledged when using social media data in
    health research. While much has been said regarding the ethical considerations
    of social media research, health research leads to an additional set of concerns.
    We provide practical suggestions in the form of guidelines for researchers working
    with social media data in health research. These guidelines can inform an IRB
    proposal for researchers new to social media health research.

  abstract: We present a new freely available dictionary of paraphrases of Czech complex
    predicates with light verbs, ParaDi. Candidates for single predicative paraphrases
    of selected complex predicates have been extracted automatically from large monolingual
    data using word2vec. They have been manually verified and further refined. We
    demonstrate one of many possible applications of ParaDi in an experiment with
    improving machine translation quality.

  abstract: This paper describes an approach for the classification of millions of
    existing multi-word entities (MWEntities), such as organisation or event names,
    into thirteen category types, based only on the tokens they contain. In order
    to classify our very large in-house collection of multilingual MWEntities into
    an application-oriented set of entity categories, we trained and tested distantly-supervised
    classifiers in 43 languages based on MWEntities extracted from BabelNet. The best-performing
    classifier was the multi-class SVM using a TF.IDF-weighted data representation.
    Interestingly, one unique classifier trained on a mix of all languages consistently
    performed better than classifiers trained for individual languages, reaching an
    averaged F1-value of 88.8%. In this paper, we present the training and test data,
    including a human evaluation of its accuracy, describe the methods used to train
    the classifiers, and discuss the results.

  abstract: This paper presents a new strategy for multilingual collocation extraction
    which takes advantage of parallel corpora to learn bilingual word-embeddings.
    Monolingual collocation candidates are retrieved using Universal Dependencies,
    while the distributional models are then applied to search for equivalents of
    the elements of each collocation in the target languages. The proposed method
    extracts not only collocation equivalents with direct translation between languages,
    but also other cases where the collocations in the two languages are not literal
    translations of each other. Several experiments -evaluating collocations with
    three syntactic patterns- in English, Spanish, and Portuguese show that our approach
    can effectively extract large pairs of bilingual equivalents with an average precision
    of about 90%. Moreover, preliminary results on comparable corpora suggest that
    the distributional models can be applied for identifying new bilingual collocations
    in different domains.

  abstract: "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are known as a \u201Cpain in the neck\u201D\
    \ for NLP due to their idiosyncratic behaviour. While some categories of MWEs\
    \ have been addressed by many studies, verbal MWEs (VMWEs), such as to take a\
    \ decision, to break one\u2019s heart or to turn off, have been rarely modelled.\
    \ This is notably due to their syntactic variability, which hinders treating them\
    \ as \u201Cwords with spaces\u201D. We describe an initiative meant to bring about\
    \ substantial progress in understanding, modelling and processing VMWEs. It is\
    \ a joint effort, carried out within a European research network, to elaborate\
    \ universal terminologies and annotation guidelines for 18 languages. Its main\
    \ outcome is a multilingual 5-million-word annotated corpus which underlies a\
    \ shared task on automatic identification of VMWEs. This paper presents the corpus\
    \ annotation methodology and outcome, the shared task organisation and the results\

  abstract: Identifying multiword expressions (MWEs) in a sentence in order to ensure
    their proper processing in subsequent applications, like machine translation,
    and performing the syntactic analysis of the sentence are interrelated processes.
    In our approach, priority is given to parsing alternatives involving collocations,
    and hence collocational information helps the parser through the maze of alternatives,
    with the aim to lead to substantial improvements in the performance of both tasks
    (collocation identification and parsing), and in that of a subsequent task (machine
    translation). In this paper, we are going to present our system and the procedure
    that we have followed in order to participate to the open track of the PARSEME
    shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs)
    in running texts.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the MUMULS system that participated to the 2017
    shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs).
    The MUMULS system was implemented using a supervised approach based on recurrent
    neural networks using the open source library TensorFlow. The model was trained
    on a data set containing annotated VMWEs as well as morphological and syntactic
    information. The MUMULS system performed the identification of VMWEs in 15 languages,
    it was one of few systems that could categorize VMWEs type in nearly all languages.

  abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) pose a problem for lexicalist theories like
    Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), since they are prima facie counterexamples to
    a strong form of the lexical integrity principle, which entails that a lexical
    item can only be realised as a single, syntactically atomic word. In this paper,
    I demonstrate some of the problems facing any strongly lexicalist account of MWEs,
    and argue that the lexical integrity principle must be weakened. I conclude by
    sketching a formalism which integrates a Tree Adjoining Grammar into the LFG architecture,
    taking advantage of this relaxation.

    to process than the canonical forms themselves. This fits with recent corpus findings.

  abstract: We propose a method for joint unsupervised discovery of multiword expressions
    (MWEs) and their translations from parallel corpora. First, we apply independent
    monolingual MWE extraction in source and target languages simultaneously. Then,
    we calculate translation probability, association score and distributional similarity

    a linear combination of these features. Preliminary experiments on light verb
    constructions show promising results.

  abstract: We discuss an experiment on automatic identification of bi-gram multi-word
    expressions in parallel Latvian and Lithuanian corpora. Raw corpora, lexical association
    measures (LAMs) and supervised machine learning (ML) are used due to deficit and
    quality of lexical resources (e.g., POS-tagger, parser) and tools. While combining
    LAMs with ML is rather effective for other languages, it has shown some nice results
    for Lithuanian and Latvian as well. Combining LAMs with ML we have achieved 92,4%
    precision and 52,2% recall for Latvian and 95,1% precision and 77,8% recall for
    Lithuanian.

    variance is correlated with compositionality and thus worth a closer look in the

  abstract: Noun compounds (NCs) are semantically complex and not fully compositional,
    as is often assumed. This paper presents a pilot study regarding the semantic
    annotation of environmental NCs with a view to accessing their semantics and exploring
    their domain-based contextual variation. Our results showed that the semantic
    annotation of NCs afforded important insights into how context impacts their conceptualization.

  abstract: A description of a system for identifying Verbal Multi-Word Expressions
    (VMWEs) in running text is presented. The system mainly exploits universal syntactic
    dependency features through a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) sequence model.
    The system competed in the Closed Track at the PARSEME VMWE Shared Task 2017,
    ranking 2nd place in most languages on full VMWE-based evaluation and 1st in three
    languages on token-based evaluation. In addition, this paper presents an option
    to re-rank the 10 best CRF-predicted sequences via semantic vectors, boosting
    its scores above other systems in the competition. We also show that all systems
    in the competition would struggle to beat a simple lookup baseline system and
    argue for a more purpose-specific evaluation scheme.

  abstract: "\u201CMultiword expressions\u201D are groups of words acting as a morphologic,\
    \ syntactic and semantic unit in linguistic analysis. Verbal multiword expressions\
    \ represent the subgroup of multiword expressions, namely that in which a verb\
    \ is the syntactic head of the group considered in its canonical (or dictionary)\
    \ form. All multiword expressions are a great challenge for natural language processing,\
    \ but the verbal ones are particularly interesting for tasks such as parsing,\
    \ as the verb is the central element in the syntactic organization of a sentence.\
    \ In this paper we introduce our data-driven approach to verbal multiword expressions\
    \ which was objectively validated during the PARSEME shared task on verbal multiword\
    \ expressions identification. We tested our approach on 12 languages, and we provide\
    \ detailed information about corpora composition, feature selection process, validation\
    \ procedure and performance on all languages."

    automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions. We participated in the
    closed track only, for all the 18 available languages. Our system is a robust
    greedy transition-based system, in which MWE are identified through a MERGE transition.
    The system was meant to accommodate the variety of linguistic resources provided
    for each language, in terms of accompanying morphological and syntactic information.
    Using per-MWE Fscore, the system was ranked first for all but two languages (Hungarian
    and Romanian).

  abstract: This study investigates the supervised token-based identification of Multiword
    Expressions (MWEs). This is an ongoing research to exploit the information contained
    in the contexts in which different instances of an expression could occur. This
    information is used to investigate the question of whether an expression is literal
    or MWE. Lexical and syntactic context features derived from vector representations
    are shown to be more effective over traditional statistical measures to identify
    tokens of MWEs.

  abstract: We are developing a broad-coverage deep semantic lexicon for a system
    that parses sentences into a logical form expressed in a rich ontology that supports
    reasoning. In this paper we look at verb-particle constructions (VPCs), and the
    extent to which they can be treated compositionally vs idiomatically. First we
    distinguish between the different types of VPCs based on their compositionality
    and then present a set of heuristics for classifying specific instances as compositional
    or not. We then identify a small set of general sense classes for particles when
    used compositionally and discuss the resulting lexical representations that are
    being added to the lexicon. By treating VPCs as compositional whenever possible,
    we attain broad coverage in a compact way, and also enable interpretations of
    novel VPC usages not explicitly present in the lexicon.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of verb-particle constructions
    in English questions. We present a small dataset that contains questions and verb-particle
    construction candidates. We demonstrate that there are significant differences
    in the distribution of WH-words, verbs and prepositions/particles in sentences
    that contain VPCs and sentences that contain only verb + prepositional phrase
    combinations both by statistical means and in machine learning experiments. Hence,
    VPCs and non-VPCs can be effectively separated from each other by using a rich
    feature set, containing several novel features.

    combines a basic frequency-based approach with a form-to-lemma mapping to approximate
    morphological operations. With the exception of a small set of hand-crafted rules
    for modeling transitional elements, this approach is resource-poor. In our evaluation,
    the simple splitter outperforms a splitter relying on rich morphological resources.

  abstract: We present a simple and efficient tagger capable of identifying highly
    ambiguous multiword expressions (MWEs) in French texts. It is based on conditional
    random fields (CRF), using local context information as features. We show that
    this approach can obtain results that, in some cases, approach more sophisticated
    parser-based MWE identification methods without requiring syntactic trees from
    a treebank. Moreover, we study how well the CRF can take into account external
    information coming from a lexicon.

  abstract: "This paper aims at assessing to what extent a syntax-based method (Recurring\
    \ Lexico-syntactic Trees (RLT) extraction) allows us to extract large phraseological\
    \ units such as prefabricated routines, e.g. \u201Cas previously said\u201D or\
    \ \u201Cas far as we/I know\u201D in scientific writing. In order to evaluate\
    \ this method, we compare it to the classical ngram extraction technique, on a\
    \ subset of recurring segments including speech verbs in a French corpus of scientific\
    \ writing. Results show that the LRT extraction technique is far more efficient\
    \ for extended MWEs such as routines or collocations but performs more poorly\
    \ for surface phenomena such as syntactic constructions or fully frozen expressions."

  abstract: This paper presents a methodology for identifying and resolving various
    kinds of inconsistency in the context of merging dependency and multiword expression
    (MWE) annotations, to generate a dependency treebank with comprehensive MWE annotations.
    Candidates for correction are identified using a variety of heuristics, including
    an entirely novel one which identifies violations of MWE constituency in the dependency
    tree, and resolved by arbitration with minimal human intervention. Using this
    technique, we identified and corrected several hundred errors across both parse
    and MWE annotations, representing changes to a significant percentage (well over
    10%) of the MWE instances in the joint corpus.

  abstract: As multiword expressions (MWEs) exhibit a range of idiosyncrasies, their
    automatic detection warrants the use of many different features. Tsvetkov and
    Wintner (2014) proposed a Bayesian network model that combines linguistically
    motivated features and also models their interactions. In this paper, we extend
    their model with new features and apply it to Croatian, a morphologically complex
    and a relatively free word order language, achieving a satisfactory performance
    of 0.823 F1-score. Furthermore, by comparing against (semi)naive Bayes models,
    we demonstrate that manually modeling feature interactions is indeed important.
    We make our annotated dataset of Croatian MWEs freely available.

  abstract: This paper compares a neural network DSM relying on textual co-occurrences
    with a multi-modal model integrating visual information. We focus on nominal vs.
    verbal compounds, and zoom into lexical, empirical and perceptual target properties
    to explore the contribution of the visual modality. Our experiments show that
    (i) visual features contribute differently for verbs than for nouns, and (ii)
    images complement textual information, if (a) the textual modality by itself is
    poor and appropriate image subsets are used, or (b) the textual modality by itself
    is rich and large (potentially noisy) images are added.

  abstract: "Interpersonal violence (IPV) is a prominent sociological problem that\
    \ affects people of all demographic backgrounds. By analyzing how readers interpret,\
    \ perceive, and react to experiences narrated in social media posts, we explore\
    \ an understudied source for discourse about abuse. We asked readers to annotate\
    \ Reddit posts about relationships with vs. without IPV for stakeholder roles\
    \ and emotion, while measuring their galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse, and\
    \ facial expression. We map annotations to coreference resolution output to obtain\
    \ a labeled coreference chain for stakeholders in texts, and apply automated semantic\
    \ role labeling for analyzing IPV discourse. Findings provide insights into how\
    \ readers process roles and emotion in narratives. For example, abusers tend to\
    \ be linked with violent actions and certain affect states. We train classifiers\
    \ to predict stakeholder categories of coreference chains. We also find that subjects\u2019\
    \ GSR noticeably changed for IPV texts, suggesting that co-collected measurement-based\
    \ data about annotators can be used to support text annotation."

  abstract: This paper describes current efforts in developing an annotation schema

    for representing modality, attitudes, and tense and present an annotation schema
    that makes these distinctions. EL has proved competitive with other logical formulations
    in speed and inference-enablement, while expressing a wider array of natural language
    phenomena including intensional modification of predicates and sentences, propositional
    attitudes, and tense and aspect.

    \ to represent negation and its scope on top of widely-used linguistic resources.\
    \ In this paper, we investigate the possibility of obtaining a first-order logic\
    \ representation with negation scope marked using Universal Dependencies. To do\
    \ so, we enhance UDepLambda, a framework that converts dependency graphs to logical\
    \ forms. The resulting UDepLambda\xAC is able to handle phenomena related to scope\
    \ by means of an higher-order type theory, relevant not only to negation but also\
    \ to universal quantification and other complex semantic phenomena. The initial\
    \ conversion we did for English is promising, in that one can represent the scope\
    \ of negation also in the presence of more complex phenomena such as universal\
    \ quantifiers."

  abstract: In this paper we present a complete framework for the annotation of negation
    in Italian, which accounts for both negation scope and negation focus, and also
    for language-specific phenomena such as negative concord. In our view, the annotation
    of negation complements more comprehensive Natural Language Processing tasks,
    such as temporal information processing and sentiment analysis. We applied the
    proposed framework and the guidelines built on top of it to the annotation of
    written texts, namely news articles and tweets, thus producing annotated data
    for a total of over 36,000 tokens.

    clinical documents. A corpus of anamnesis and radiology reports has been annotated
    by two domain expert annotators with negation markers and negated events. The
    Dice coefficient for inter-annotator agreement is higher than 0.94 for negation
    markers and higher than 0.72 for negated events. The corpus will be publicly released
    when the annotation process is finished, constituting the first corpus annotated
    with negation for Spanish clinical reports available for the NLP community.

  abstract: 'Negation cue detection involves identifying the span inherently expressing
    negation in a negative sentence. In Chinese, negative cue detection is complicated
    by morphological proprieties of the language. Previous work has shown that negative
    cue detection in Chinese can benefit from specific lexical and morphemic features,
    as well as cross-lingual information. We show here that they are not necessary:
    A bi-directional LSTM can perform equally well, with minimal feature engineering.
    In particular, the use of a character-based model allows us to capture characteristics
    of negation cues in Chinese using word-embedding information only. Not only does
    our model performs on par with previous work, further error analysis clarifies
    what problems remain to be addressed.'

  abstract: 'This article describes a method to build semantic representations of
    composite expressions in a compositional way by using WordNet relations to represent
    the meaning of words. The meaning of a target word is modelled as a vector in
    which its semantically related words are assigned weights according to both the
    type of the relationship and the distance to the target word. Word vectors are
    compositionally combined by syntactic dependencies. Each syntactic dependency
    triggers two complementary compositional functions: the named head function and
    dependent function. The experiments show that the proposed compositional method
    outperforms the state-of-the-art for both intransitive subject-verb and transitive
    subject-verb-object constructions.'

  abstract: We present a fully unsupervised method for automated construction of WordNets
    based upon recent advances in distributional representations of sentences and
    word-senses combined with readily available machine translation tools. The approach
    requires very few linguistic resources and is thus extensible to multiple target
    languages. To evaluate our method we construct two 600-word testsets for word-to-synset
    matching in French and Russian using native speakers and evaluate the performance
    of our method along with several other recent approaches. Our method exceeds the
    best language-specific and multi-lingual automated WordNets in F-score for both
    languages. The databases we construct for French and Russian, both languages without
    large publicly available manually constructed WordNets, will be publicly released
    along with the testsets.

  abstract: 'Abstract words refer to things that can not be seen, heard, felt, smelled,
    or tasted as opposed to concrete words. Among other applications, the degree of
    abstractness has been shown to be a useful information for metaphor detection.
    Our contribution to this topic are as follows: i) we compare supervised techniques
    to learn and extend abstractness ratings for huge vocabularies ii) we learn and
    investigate norms for larger units by propagating abstractness to verb-noun pairs
    which lead to better metaphor detection iii) we overcome the limitation of learning
    a single rating per word and show that multi-sense abstractness ratings are potentially
    useful for metaphor detection. Finally, with this paper we publish automatically
    created abstractness norms for 3million English words and multi-words as well
    as automatically created sense specific abstractness ratings'

  abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the task of automatically inferring
    the most probable diagnosis from a given clinical narrative. Structured Knowledge
    Bases (KBs) can be useful for such complex tasks but not sufficient. Hence, we
    leverage a vast amount of unstructured free text to integrate with structured
    KBs. The key innovative ideas include building a concept graph from both structured
    and unstructured knowledge sources and ranking the diagnosis concepts using the
    enhanced word embedding vectors learned from integrated sources. Experiments on
    the TREC CDS and HumanDx datasets showed that our methods improved the results
    of clinical diagnosis inference.

  abstract: Usage similarity (USim) is an approach to determining word meaning in
    context that does not rely on a sense inventory. Instead, pairs of usages of a
    target lemma are rated on a scale. In this paper we propose unsupervised approaches
    to USim based on embeddings for words, contexts, and sentences, and achieve state-of-the-art
    results over two USim datasets. We further consider supervised approaches to USim,
    and find that although they outperform unsupervised approaches, they are unable
    to generalize to lemmas that are unseen in the training data.

  abstract: Properly written texts in Igbo, a low-resource African language, are rich
    in both orthographic and tonal diacritics. Diacritics are essential in capturing
    the distinctions in pronunciation and meaning of words, as well as in lexical
    disambiguation. Unfortunately, most electronic texts in diacritic languages are
    written without diacritics. This makes diacritic restoration a necessary step
    in corpus building and language processing tasks for languages with diacritics.
    In our previous work, we built some n-gram models with simple smoothing techniques
    based on a closed-world assumption. However, as a classification task, diacritic
    restoration is well suited for and will be more generalisable with machine learning.
    This paper, therefore, presents a more standard approach to dealing with the task
    which involves the application of machine learning algorithms.

  abstract: 'Creating high-quality wide-coverage multilingual semantic lexicons to
    support knowledge-based approaches is a challenging time-consuming manual task.
    This has traditionally been performed by linguistic experts: a slow and expensive
    process. We present an experiment in which we adapt and evaluate crowdsourcing
    methods employing native speakers to generate a list of coarse-grained senses
    under a common multilingual semantic taxonomy for sets of words in six languages.
    451 non-experts (including 427 Mechanical Turk workers) and 15 expert participants
    semantically annotated 250 words manually for Arabic, Chinese, English, Italian,
    Portuguese and Urdu lexicons. In order to avoid erroneous (spam) crowdsourced
    results, we used a novel task-specific two-phase filtering process where users
    were asked to identify synonyms in the target language, and remove erroneous senses.'

  abstract: 'We introduce a new method for unsupervised knowledge-based word sense
    disambiguation (WSD) based on a resource that links two types of sense-aware lexical
    networks: one is induced from a corpus using distributional semantics, the other
    is manually constructed. The combination of two networks reduces the sparsity
    of sense representations used for WSD. We evaluate these enriched representations
    within two lexical sample sense disambiguation benchmarks. Our results indicate
    that (1) features extracted from the corpus-based resource help to significantly
    outperform a model based solely on the lexical resource; (2) our method achieves
    results comparable or better to four state-of-the-art unsupervised knowledge-based
    WSD systems including three hybrid systems that also rely on text corpora. In
    contrast to these hybrid methods, our approach does not require access to web
    search engines, texts mapped to a sense inventory, or machine translation systems.'

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether an a priori disambiguation of word
    senses is strictly necessary or whether the meaning of a word in context can be
    disambiguated through composition alone. We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf
    single-vector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase similarity task
    and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that single-sense vector
    models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector models despite arguably
    less clean elementary representations. Our findings furthermore show that simple
    composition functions such as pointwise addition are able to recover sense specific
    information from a single-sense vector model remarkably well.

  abstract: This paper describes a method to measure the lexical gap of action verbs
    in Italian and English by using the IMAGACT ontology of action. The fine-grained
    categorization of action concepts of the data source allowed to have wide overview
    of the relation between concepts in the two languages. The calculated lexical
    gap for both English and Italian is about 30% of the action concepts, much higher
    than previous results. Beyond this general numbers a deeper analysis has been
    performed in order to evaluate the impact that lexical gaps can have on translation.
    In particular a distinction has been made between the cases in which the presence
    of a lexical gap affects translation correctness and completeness at a semantic
    level. The results highlight a high percentage of concepts that can be considered
    hard to translate (about 18% from English to Italian and 20% from Italian to English)
    and confirms that action verbs are a critical lexical class for translation tasks.

  abstract: The role of word sense disambiguation in lexical substitution has been
    questioned due to the high performance of vector space models which propose good
    substitutes without explicitly accounting for sense. We show that a filtering
    mechanism based on a sense inventory optimized for substitutability can improve
    the results of these models. Our sense inventory is constructed using a clustering
    method which generates paraphrase clusters that are congruent with lexical substitution
    annotations in a development set. The results show that lexical substitution can
    still benefit from senses which can improve the output of vector space paraphrase
    ranking models.

  abstract: This paper compares two approaches to word sense disambiguation using
    word embeddings trained on unambiguous synonyms. The first is unsupervised method
    based on computing log probability from sequences of word embedding vectors, taking
    into account ambiguous word senses and guessing correct sense from context. The
    second method is supervised. We use a multilayer neural network model to learn
    a context-sensitive transformation that maps an input vector of ambiguous word
    into an output vector representing its sense. We evaluate both methods on corpora
    with manual annotations of word senses from the Polish wordnet (plWordnet).

    \ a novel, character-by-character variant of the DiET chat tool (Healey et al.,\
    \ 2003; anon.) with a novel task, where a Learner needs to learn invented visual\
    \ attribute words (such as \u201Cburchak\u201D for square) from a tutor. As such,\
    \ the text-based interactions closely resemble face-to-face conversation and thus\
    \ contain many of the linguistic phenomena encountered in natural, spontaneous\
    \ dialogue. These include self- and other-correction, mid-sentence continuations,\
    \ interruptions, turn overlaps, fillers, hedges and many kinds of ellipsis. We\
    \ also present a generic n-gram framework for building user (i.e. tutor) simulations\
    \ from this type of incremental dialogue data, which is freely available to researchers.\
    \ We show that the simulations produce outputs that are similar to the original\

    \ This is in contrast to most work on integrated vision and language in the literature,\
    \ where textual descriptions are tightly linked to the image content, and often\

  abstract: 'In this paper, we study how humans perceive the use of images as an additional
    knowledge source to machine-translate user-generated product listings in an e-commerce
    company. We conduct a human evaluation where we assess how a multi-modal neural
    machine translation (NMT) model compares to two text-only approaches: a conventional
    state-of-the-art attention-based NMT and a phrase-based statistical machine translation
    (PBSMT) model. We evaluate translations obtained with different systems and also
    discuss the data set of user-generated product listings, which in our case comprises
    both product listings and associated images. We found that humans preferred translations
    obtained with a PBSMT system to both text-only and multi-modal NMT over 56% of
    the time. Nonetheless, human evaluators ranked translations from a multi-modal
    NMT model as better than those of a text-only NMT over 88% of the time, which
    suggests that images do help NMT in this use-case.'

  abstract: We present BreakingNews, a novel dataset with approximately 100K news
    articles including images, text and captions, and enriched with heterogeneous
    meta-data (e.g. GPS coordinates and popularity metrics). The tenuous connection
    between the images and text in news data is appropriate to take work at the intersection
    of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to the next step, hence we
    hope this dataset will help spur progress in the field.

  abstract: We present an approach where an SVM classifier learns to classify head
    movements based on measurements of velocity, acceleration, and the third derivative
    of position with respect to time, jerk. Consequently, annotations of head movements
    are added to new video data. The results of the automatic annotation are evaluated
    against manual annotations in the same data and show an accuracy of 68% with respect
    to these. The results also show that using jerk improves accuracy. We then conduct
    an investigation of the overlap between temporal sequences classified as either
    movement or non-movement and the speech stream of the person performing the gesture.
    The statistics derived from this analysis show that using word features may help
    increase the accuracy of the model.

  abstract: Finding a product in the fashion world can be a daunting task. Everyday,
    e-commerce sites are updating with thousands of images and their associated metadata
    (textual information), deepening the problem. In this paper, we leverage both
    the images and textual metadata and propose a joint multi-modal embedding that
    maps both the text and images into a common latent space. Distances in the latent
    space correspond to similarity between products, allowing us to effectively perform
    retrieval in this latent space. We compare against existing approaches and show
    significant improvements in retrieval tasks on a large-scale e-commerce dataset.

  abstract: "Metaphor is indispensable in poetry. It showcases the poet\u2019s creativity,\
    \ and contributes to the overall emotional pertinence of the poem while honing\
    \ its specific rhetorical impact. Previous work on metaphor detection relies on\
    \ either rule-based or statistical models, none of them applied to poetry. Our\
    \ method focuses on metaphor detection in a poetry corpus. It combines rule-based\
    \ and statistical models (word embeddings) to develop a new classification system.\
    \ Our system has achieved a precision of 0.759 and a recall of 0.804 in identifying\
    \ one type of metaphor in poetry."

  abstract: This paper presents a newly funded international project for machine translation
    and automated analysis of ancient cuneiform languages where NLP specialists and
    Assyriologists collaborate to create an information retrieval system for Sumerian.
    This research is conceived in response to the need to translate large numbers
    of administrative texts that are only available in transcription, in order to
    make them accessible to a wider audience. The methodology includes creation of
    a specialized NLP pipeline and also the use of linguistic linked open data to
    increase access to the results.

  abstract: 'Literary genres are commonly viewed as being defined in terms of content
    and stylistic features. In this paper, we focus on one particular class of lexical
    features, namely emotion information, and investigate the hypothesis that emotion-related
    information correlates with particular genres. Using genre classification as a
    testbed, we compare a model that computes lexicon-based emotion scores globally
    for complete stories with a model that tracks emotion arcs through stories on
    a subset of Project Gutenberg with five genres. Our main findings are: (a), the
    global emotion model is competitive with a large-vocabulary bag-of-words genre
    classifier (80%F1); (b), the emotion arc model shows a lower performance (59 %
    F1) but shows complementary behavior to the global model, as indicated by a very
    good performance of an oracle model (94 % F1) and an improved performance of an
    ensemble model (84 % F1); (c), genres differ in the extent to which stories follow
    the same emotional arcs, with particularly uniform behavior for anger (mystery)
    and fear (adventures, romance, humor, science fiction).'

  abstract: Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines
    of poetry, giving rise to different stylistic effects. In Spanish literary studies,
    there are unclear points about the types of stylistic effects that can arise,
    and under which linguistic conditions. To systematically gather evidence about
    this, we developed a system to automatically identify enjambment (and its type)
    in Spanish. For evaluation, we manually annotated a reference corpus covering
    different periods. As a scholarly corpus to apply the tool, from public HTML sources
    we created a diachronic corpus covering four centuries of sonnets (3750 poems),
    and we analyzed the occurrence of enjambment across stanzaic boundaries in different
    periods. Besides, we found examples that highlight limitations in current definitions
    of enjambment.

  abstract: In this paper, we present the annotation challenges we have encountered
    when working on a historical language that was undergoing elaboration processes.
    We especially focus on syntactic ambiguity and gradience in Middle Low German,
    which causes uncertainty to some extent. Since current annotation tools consider
    construction contexts and the dynamics of the grammaticalization only partially,
    we plan to extend CorA - a web-based annotation tool for historical and other
    non-standard language data - to capture elaboration phenomena and annotator unsureness.
    Moreover, we seek to interactively learn morphological as well as syntactic annotations.

  abstract: "The oral component of medieval poetry was integral to its performance\
    \ and reception. Yet many believe that the medieval voice has been forever lost,\
    \ and any attempts at rediscovering it are doomed to failure due to scribal practices,\
    \ manuscript mouvance, and linguistic normalization in editing practices. This\
    \ paper offers a method to abstract from this noise and better understand relative\
    \ differences in phonological soundscapes by considering syllable qualities. The\
    \ presented syllabification method and soundscape analysis offer themselves as\
    \ cross-disciplinary tools for low-resource languages. As a case study, we examine\
    \ medieval German lyric and argue that the heavily debated lyrical \u2018I\u2019\
    \ follows a unique trajectory through soundscapes, shedding light on the performance\
    \ and practice of these poets."

  abstract: This paper presents an approach to extract co-occurrence networks from
    literary texts. It is a deliberate decision not to aim for a fully automatic pipeline,
    as the literary research questions need to guide both the definition of the nature
    of the things that co-occur as well as how to decide co-occurrence. We showcase
    the approach on a Middle High German romance, Parzival. Manual inspection and
    discussion shows the huge impact various choices have.

  abstract: We present a data-driven approach to investigate intra-textual variation
    by combining entropy and surprisal. With this approach we detect linguistic variation
    based on phrasal lexico-grammatical patterns across sections of research articles.
    Entropy is used to detect patterns typical of specific sections. Surprisal is
    used to differentiate between more and less informationally-loaded patterns as
    well as type of information (topical vs. stylistic). While we here focus on research
    articles in biology/genetics, the methodology is especially interesting for digital
    humanities scholars, as it can be applied to any text type or domain and combined
    with additional variables (e.g. time, author or social group).

  abstract: In this paper, we present our preliminary study on an ontology-based method
    to extract and classify compositional nominal compounds in specific domains of
    knowledge. This method is based on the assumption that, applying a conceptual
    model to represent knowledge domain, it is possible to improve the extraction
    and classification of lexicon occurrences for that domain in a semi-automatic
    way. We explore the possibility of extracting and classifying a specific construction
    type (nominal compounds) spanning a specific domain (Cultural Heritage) and a
    specific language (Italian).

  abstract: In this paper, we present ongoing work for developing language resources
    and basic NLP tools for an undocumented variety of Romansh, in the context of
    a language documentation and language acquisition project. Our tools are meant
    to improve the speed and reliability of corpus annotations for noisy data involving
    large amounts of code-switching, occurrences of child-speech and orthographic
    noise. Being able to increase the efficiency of language resource development
    for language documentation and acquisition research also constitutes a step towards
    solving the data sparsity issues with which researchers have been struggling.

  abstract: This paper presents a statistical approach to automatic morphosyntactic
    annotation of Hittite transcripts. Hittite is an extinct Indo-European language
    using the cuneiform script. There are currently no morphosyntactic annotations
    available for Hittite, so we explored methods of distant supervision. The annotations
    were projected from parallel German translations of the Hittite texts. In order
    to reduce data sparsity, we applied stemming of German and Hittite texts. As there
    is no off-the-shelf Hittite stemmer, a stemmer for Hittite was developed for this
    purpose. The resulting annotation projections were used to train a POS tagger,
    achieving an accuracy of 69% on a test sample. To our knowledge, this is the first
    attempt of statistical POS tagging of a cuneiform language.

  abstract: The last decade saw a surge in digitisation efforts for ancient manuscripts
    in Sanskrit. Due to various linguistic peculiarities inherent to the language,
    even the preliminary tasks such as word segmentation are non-trivial in Sanskrit.
    Elegant models for Word Segmentation in Sanskrit are indispensable for further
    syntactic and semantic processing of the manuscripts. Current works in word segmentation
    for Sanskrit, though commendable in their novelty, often have variations in their
    objective and evaluation criteria. In this work, we set the record straight. We
    formally define the objectives and the requirements for the word segmentation
    task. In order to encourage research in the field and to alleviate the time and
    effort required in pre-processing, we release a dataset of 115,000 sentences for
    word segmentation. For each sentence in the dataset we include the input character
    sequence, ground truth segmentation, and additionally lexical and morphological
    information about all the phonetically possible segments for the given sentence.
    In this work, we also discuss the linguistic considerations made while generating
    the candidate space of the possible segments.

  abstract: We present a system for automatically detecting and classifying phonologically
    anomalous productions in the speech of individuals with aphasia. Working from
    transcribed discourse samples, our system identifies neologisms, and uses a combination
    of string alignment and language models to produce a lattice of plausible words
    that the speaker may have intended to produce. We then score this lattice according
    to various features, and attempt to determine whether the anomalous production
    represented a phonemic error or a genuine neologism. This approach has the potential
    to be expanded to consider other types of paraphasic errors, and could be applied
    to a wide variety of screening and therapeutic applications.

  abstract: We propose a novel attention mechanism for a Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN)-based Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) extraction model. CNNs have been shown
    to have a great potential on DDI extraction tasks; however, attention mechanisms,
    which emphasize important words in the sentence of a target-entity pair, have
    not been investigated with the CNNs despite the fact that attention mechanisms
    are shown to be effective for a general domain relation classification task. We
    evaluated our model on the Task 9.2 of the DDIExtraction-2013 shared task. As
    a result, our attention mechanism improved the performance of our base CNN-based
    DDI model, and the model achieved an F-score of 69.12%, which is competitive with
    the state-of-the-art models.

  abstract: 'Analogy completion has been a popular task in recent years for evaluating
    the semantic properties of word embeddings, but the standard methodology makes
    a number of assumptions about analogies that do not always hold, either in recent
    benchmark datasets or when expanding into other domains. Through an analysis of
    analogies in the biomedical domain, we identify three assumptions: that of a Single
    Answer for any given analogy, that the pairs involved describe the Same Relationship,
    and that each pair is Informative with respect to the other. We propose modifying
    the standard methodology to relax these assumptions by allowing for multiple correct
    answers, reporting MAP and MRR in addition to accuracy, and using multiple example
    pairs. We further present BMASS, a novel dataset for evaluating linguistic regularities
    in biomedical embeddings, and demonstrate that the relationships described in
    the dataset pose significant semantic challenges to current word embedding methods.'

  abstract: "State-of-the-art methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction\
    \ are primarily feature-based or kernel-based by leveraging lexical and syntactic\
    \ information. But how to incorporate such knowledge in the recent deep learning\
    \ methods remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a multichannel dependency-based\
    \ convolutional neural network model (McDepCNN). It applies one channel to the\
    \ embedding vector of each word in the sentence, and another channel to the embedding\
    \ vector of the head of the corresponding word. Therefore, the model can use richer\
    \ information obtained from different channels. Experiments on two public benchmarking\
    \ datasets, AIMed and BioInfer, demonstrate that McDepCNN provides up to 6% F1-score\
    \ improvement over rich feature-based methods and single-kernel methods. In addition,\
    \ McDepCNN achieves 24.4% relative improvement in F1-score over the state-of-the-art\
    \ methods on cross-corpus evaluation and 12% improvement in F1-score over kernel-based\
    \ methods on \u201Cdifficult\u201D instances. These results suggest that McDepCNN\
    \ generalizes more easily over different corpora, and is capable of capturing\
    \ long distance features in the sentences."

  abstract: 'Linking spans of natural language text to concepts in a structured source
    is an important task for many problems. It allows intelligent systems to leverage
    rich knowledge available in those sources (such as concept properties and relations)
    to enhance the semantics of the mentions of these concepts in text. In the medical
    domain, it is common to link text spans to medical concepts in large, curated
    knowledge repositories such as the Unified Medical Language System. Different
    approaches have different strengths: some are precision-oriented, some recall-oriented;
    some better at considering context but more prone to hallucination. The variety
    of techniques suggests that ensembling could outperform component technologies
    at this task. In this paper, we describe our process for building a Stacking ensemble
    using additional, auxiliary features for Entity Linking in the medical domain.
    We report experiments that show that naive ensembling does not always outperform
    component Entity Linking systems, that stacking usually outperforms naive ensembling,
    and that auxiliary features added to the stacker further improve its performance
    on three distinct datasets. Our best model produces state-of-the-art results on
    several medical datasets.'

  abstract: 'The goal of the BioASQ challenge is to engage researchers into creating
    cuttingedge biomedical information systems. Specifically, it aims at the promotion
    of systems and methodologies that are able to deal with a plethora of different
    tasks in the biomedical domain. This is achieved through the organization of challenges.
    The fifth challenge consisted of three tasks: semantic indexing, question answering
    and a new task on information extraction. In total, 29 teams with more than 95
    systems participated in the challenge. Overall, as in previous years, the best
    systems were able to outperform the strong baselines. This suggests that state-of-the
    art systems are continuously improving, pushing the frontier of research.'

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our participation in phase B of task 5b of
    the fifth edition of the annual BioASQ challenge, which includes answering factoid,
    list, yes-no and summary questions from biomedical data. We describe our techniques
    with an emphasis on ideal answer generation, where the goal is to produce a relevant,
    precise, non-redundant, query-oriented summary from multiple relevant documents.
    We make use of extractive summarization techniques to address this task and experiment
    with different biomedical ontologies and various algorithms including agglomerative
    clustering, Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) and sentence compression. We propose
    a novel word embedding based tf-idf similarity metric and a soft positional constraint
    which improve our system performance. We evaluate our techniques on test batch
    4 from the fourth edition of the challenge. Our best system achieves a ROUGE-2
    score of 0.6534 and ROUGE-SU4 score of 0.6536.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission to the 2017 BioASQ challenge. We participated
    in Task B, Phase B which is concerned with biomedical question answering (QA).
    We focus on factoid and list question, using an extractive QA model, that is,
    we restrict our system to output substrings of the provided text snippets. At
    the core of our system, we use FastQA, a state-of-the-art neural QA system. We
    extended it with biomedical word embeddings and changed its answer layer to be
    able to answer list questions in addition to factoid questions. We pre-trained
    the model on a large-scale open-domain QA dataset, SQuAD, and then fine-tuned
    the parameters on the BioASQ training set. With our approach, we achieve state-of-the-art
    results on factoid questions and competitive results on list questions.

  abstract: We introduce an end-to-end system capable of named-entity detection, normalization
    and relation extraction for extracting information about bacteria and their habitats
    from biomedical literature. Our system is based on deep learning, CRF classifiers
    and vector space models. We train and evaluate the system on the BioNLP 2016 Shared
    Task Bacteria Biotope data. The official evaluation shows that the joint performance
    of our entity detection and relation extraction models outperforms the winning
    team of the Shared Task by 19pp on F1-score, establishing a new top score for
    the task. We also achieve state-of-the-art results in the normalization task.
    Our system is open source and freely available at https://github.com/TurkuNLP/BHE.

  abstract: ext mining automatically extracts information from the literature with
    the goal of making it available for further analysis, for example by incorporating
    it into biomedical databases. A key first step towards this goal is to identify
    and normalize the named entities, such as proteins and species, which are mentioned
    in text. Despite the large detrimental impact that viruses have on human and agricultural
    health, very little previous text-mining work has focused on identifying virus
    species and proteins in the literature. Here, we present an improved dictionary-based
    system for viral species and the first dictionary for viral proteins, which we
    benchmark on a new corpus of 300 manually annotated abstracts. We achieve 81.0%
    precision and 72.7% recall at the task of recognizing and normalizing viral species
    and 76.2% precision and 34.9% recall on viral proteins. These results are achieved
    despite the many challenges involved with the names of viral species and, especially,
    proteins. This work provides a foundation that can be used to extract more complicated
    relations about viruses from the literature.

  abstract: We propose in this paper a semi-supervised method for labeling terms of
    texts with concepts of a domain ontology. The method generates continuous vector
    representations of complex terms in a semantic space structured by the ontology.
    The proposed method relies on a distributional semantics approach, which generates
    initial vectors for each of the extracted terms. Then these vectors are embedded
    in the vector space constructed from the structure of the ontology. This embedding
    is carried out by training a linear model. Finally, we apply a distance calculation
    to determine the proximity between vectors of terms and vectors of concepts and
    thus to assign ontology labels to terms. We have evaluated the quality of these
    representations for a normalization task by using the concepts of an ontology
    as semantic labels. Normalization of terms is an important step to extract a part
    of the information containing in texts, but the vector space generated might find
    other applications. The performance of this method is comparable to that of the
    state of the art for this task of standardization, opening up encouraging prospects.

  abstract: "Vector space methods that measure semantic similarity and relatedness\
    \ often rely on distributional information such as co\u2013occurrence frequencies\
    \ or statistical measures of association to weight the importance of particular\
    \ co\u2013occurrences. In this paper, we extend these methods by incorporating\
    \ a measure of semantic similarity based on a human curated taxonomy into a second\u2013\
    order vector representation. This results in a measure of semantic relatedness\
    \ that combines both the contextual information available in a corpus\u2013based\
    \ vector space representation with the semantic knowledge found in a biomedical\
    \ ontology. Our results show that incorporating semantic similarity into a second\
    \ order co-occurrence matrices improves correlation with human judgments for both\
    \ similarity and relatedness, and that our method compares favorably to various\
    \ different word embedding methods that have recently been evaluated on the same\
    \ reference standards we have used."

  abstract: The goal of active learning is to minimise the cost of producing an annotated
    dataset, in which annotators are assumed to be perfect, i.e., they always choose
    the correct labels. However, in practice, annotators are not infallible, and they
    are likely to assign incorrect labels to some instances. Proactive learning is
    a generalisation of active learning that can model different kinds of annotators.
    Although proactive learning has been applied to certain labelling tasks, such
    as text classification, there is little work on its application to named entity
    (NE) tagging. In this paper, we propose a proactive learning method for producing
    NE annotated corpora, using two annotators with different levels of expertise,
    and who charge different amounts based on their levels of experience. To optimise
    both cost and annotation quality, we also propose a mechanism to present multiple
    sentences to annotators at each iteration. Experimental results for several corpora
    show that our method facilitates the construction of high-quality NE labelled
    datasets at minimal cost.

  abstract: Social media sites (e.g., Twitter) have been used for surveillance of
    drug safety at the population level, but studies that focus on the effects of
    medications on specific sets of individuals have had to rely on other sources
    of data. Mining social media data for this in-formation would require the ability
    to distinguish indications of personal medication in-take in this media. Towards
    that end, this paper presents an annotated corpus that can be used to train machine
    learning systems to determine whether a tweet that mentions a medication indicates
    that the individual posting has taken that medication at a specific time. To demonstrate
    the utility of the corpus as a training set, we present baseline results of supervised
    classification.

  abstract: We present an unsupervised context-sensitive spelling correction method
    for clinical free-text that uses word and character n-gram embeddings. Our method
    generates misspelling replacement candidates and ranks them according to their
    semantic fit, by calculating a weighted cosine similarity between the vectorized
    representation of a candidate and the misspelling context. We greatly outperform
    two baseline off-the-shelf spelling correction tools on a manually annotated MIMIC-III
    test set, and counter the frequency bias of an optimized noisy channel model,
    showing that neural embeddings can be successfully exploited to include context-awareness
    in a spelling correction model.

  abstract: Approximately 80% to 95% of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
    (ALS) eventually develop speech impairments, such as defective articulation, slow
    laborious speech and hypernasality. The relationship between impaired speech and
    asymptomatic speech may be seen as a divergence from a baseline. This relationship
    can be characterized in terms of measurable combinations of phonological characteristics
    that are indicative of the degree to which the two diverge. We demonstrate that
    divergence measurements based on phonological characteristics of speech correlate
    with physiological assessments of ALS. Speech-based assessments offer benefits
    over commonly-used physiological assessments in that they are inexpensive, non-intrusive,
    and do not require trained clinical personnel for administering and interpreting
    the results.

  abstract: In clinical dictation, speakers try to be as concise as possible to save
    time, often resulting in utterances without explicit punctuation commands. Since
    the end product of a dictated report, e.g. an out-patient letter, does require
    correct orthography, including exact punctuation, the latter need to be restored,
    preferably by automated means. This paper describes a method for punctuation restoration
    based on a state-of-the-art stack of NLP and machine learning techniques including
    B-RNNs with an attention mechanism and late fusion, as well as a feature extraction
    technique tailored to the processing of medical terminology using a novel vocabulary
    reduction model. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting performance is superior
    to that reported in prior art on similar tasks.

  abstract: Distant supervision has been applied to automatically generate labeled
    data for biomedical relation extraction. Noise exists in both positively and negatively-labeled
    data and affects the performance of supervised machine learning methods. In this
    paper, we propose three novel heuristics based on the notion of proximity, trigger
    word and confidence of patterns to leverage lexical and syntactic information
    to reduce the level of noise in the distantly labeled data. Experiments on three
    different tasks, extraction of protein-protein-interaction, miRNA-gene regulation
    relation and protein-localization event, show that the proposed methods can improve
    the F-score over the baseline by 6, 10 and 14 points for the three tasks, respectively.
    We also show that when the models are configured to output high-confidence results,
    high precisions can be obtained using the proposed methods, making them promising
    for facilitating manual curation for databases.

  abstract: Electronic medical records (EMR) have largely replaced hand-written patient
    files in healthcare. The growing pool of EMR data presents a significant resource
    in medical research, but the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) mandates redacting medical records before performing any analysis
    on the same. This process complicates obtaining medical data and can remove much
    useful information from the record. As part of a larger project involving ontology-driven
    medical processing, we employ a method of recognizing protected health information
    (PHI) that maps to ontological terms. We then use the relationships defined in
    the ontology to redact medical texts so that roles and semantics of terms are
    retained without compromising anonymity. The method is evaluated by clinical experts
    on several hundred medical documents, achieving up to a 98.8% f-score, and has
    already shown promise for retaining semantic information in later processing.

  abstract: Pain and anesthesia information are crucial elements to identifying surgery-related
    processes and outcomes. However pain is not consistently recorded in the electronic
    medical record. Even when recorded, the rich complex granularity of the pain experience
    may be lost. Similarly, anesthesia information is recorded using local electronic
    collection systems; though the accuracy and completeness of the information is
    unknown. We propose an annotation schema to capture pain, pain management, and
    anesthesia event information.

  abstract: Comparison sentences are very commonly used by authors in biomedical literature
    to report results of experiments. In such comparisons, authors typically make
    observations under two different scenarios. In this paper, we present a system
    to automatically identify such comparative sentences and their components i.e.
    the compared entities, the scale of the comparison and the aspect on which the
    entities are being compared. Our methodology is based on dependencies obtained
    by applying a parser to extract a wide range of comparison structures. We evaluated
    our system for its effectiveness in identifying comparisons and their components.
    The system achieved a F-score of 0.87 for comparison sentence identification and
    0.77-0.81 for identifying its components.

  abstract: In this paper we present a solution for tagging funding bodies and grants
    in scientific articles using a combination of trained sequential learning models,
    namely conditional random fields (CRF), hidden markov models (HMM) and maximum
    entropy models (MaxEnt), on a benchmark set created in-house. We apply the trained
    models to address the BioASQ challenge 5c, which is a newly introduced task that
    aims to solve the problem of funding information extraction from scientific articles.
    Results in the dry-run data set of BioASQ task 5c show that the suggested approach
    can achieve a micro-recall of more than 85% in tagging both funding bodies and
    grants.

  abstract: "We describe a Deep Learning approach to modeling the relevance of a document\u2019\
    s text to a query, applied to biomedical literature. Instead of mapping each document\
    \ and query to a common semantic space, we compute a variable-length difference\
    \ vector between the query and document which is then passed through a deep convolution\
    \ stage followed by a deep regression network to produce the estimated probability\
    \ of the document\u2019s relevance to the query. Despite the small amount of training\
    \ data, this approach produces a more robust predictor than computing similarities\
    \ between semantic vector representations of the query and document, and also\
    \ results in significant improvements over traditional IR text factors. In the\
    \ future, we plan to explore its application in improving PubMed search."

  abstract: "Literature in Molecular Biology is abundant with linguistic metaphors.\
    \ There have been works in the past that attempt to draw parallels between linguistics\
    \ and biology, driven by the fundamental premise that proteins have a language\
    \ of their own. Since word detection is crucial to the decipherment of any unknown\
    \ language, we attempt to establish a problem mapping from natural language text\
    \ to protein sequences at the level of words. Towards this end, we explore the\
    \ use of an unsupervised text segmentation algorithm to the task of extracting\
    \ \u201Cbiological words\u201D from protein sequences. In particular, we demonstrate\
    \ the effectiveness of using domain knowledge to complement data driven approaches\
    \ in the text segmentation task, as well as in its biological counterpart. We\
    \ also propose a novel extrinsic evaluation measure for protein words through\
    \ protein family classification."

  abstract: Severe sepsis and septic shock are conditions that affect millions of
    patients and have close to 50% mortality rate. Early identification of at-risk
    patients significantly improves outcomes. Electronic surveillance tools have been
    developed to monitor structured Electronic Medical Records and automatically recognize
    early signs of sepsis. However, many sepsis risk factors (e.g. symptoms and signs
    of infection) are often captured only in free text clinical notes. In this study,
    we developed a method for automatic monitoring of nursing notes for signs and
    symptoms of infection. We utilized a creative approach to automatically generate
    an annotated dataset. The dataset was used to create a Machine Learning model
    that achieved an F1-score ranging from 79 to 96%.

    \ Frequent diseases often have more training data, which helps its classification\

    s frequency does not necessarily reflect its importance. To resolve this training\
    \ data shortage problem, we propose to strategically draw data from PubMed to\
    \ enrich the training data when there is such need. We validate our method on\

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present an analysis of feature extraction methods via
    dimensionality reduction for the task of biomedical Word Sense Disambiguation
    (WSD). We modify the vector representations in the 2-MRD WSD algorithm, and evaluate
    four dimensionality reduction methods: Word Embeddings using Continuous Bag of
    Words and Skip Gram, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA). We also evaluate the effects of vector size on the performance
    of each of these methods. Results are evaluated on five standard evaluation datasets
    (Abbrev.100, Abbrev.200, Abbrev.300, NLM-WSD, and MSH-WSD). We find that vector
    sizes of 100 are sufficient for all techniques except SVD, for which a vector
    size of 1500 is referred. We also show that SVD performs on par with Word Embeddings
    for all but one dataset.'

  abstract: In this paper, we present pilot work on characterising the documentation
    of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the United States Veterans Administration
    Electronic Health Record. The Veterans Health Administration is the largest health
    care system in the United States with 1,233 health care facilities nationwide,
    serving 8.9 million veterans per year. We identified a random sample of 2000 Veterans
    Administration patients, coded as current tobacco users, from 2008 to 2014. Using
    simple keyword matching techniques combined with qualitative analysis, we investigated
    the prevalence and distribution of e-cigarette terms in these clinical notes,
    discovering that for current smokers, 11.9% of patient records contain an e-cigarette
    related term.

  abstract: Dictated medical reports very often feature a preamble containing metainformation
    about the report such as patient and physician names, location and name of the
    clinic, date of procedure, and so on. In the medical transcription process, the
    preamble is usually omitted from the final report, as it contains information
    already available in the electronic medical record. We present a method which
    is able to automatically identify preambles in medical dictations. The method
    makes use of state-of-the-art NLP techniques including word embeddings and Bi-LSTMs
    and achieves preamble detection performance superior to humans.

  abstract: Question answering, the identification of short accurate answers to users
    questions, is a longstanding challenge widely studied over the last decades in
    the open domain. However, it still requires further efforts in the biomedical
    domain. In this paper, we describe our participation in phase B of task 5b in
    the 2017 BioASQ challenge using our biomedical question answering system. Our
    system, dealing with four types of questions (i.e., yes/no, factoid, list, and
    summary), is based on (1) a dictionary-based approach for generating the exact
    answers of yes/no questions, (2) UMLS metathesaurus and term frequency metric
    for extracting the exact answers of factoid and list questions, and (3) the BM25
    model and UMLS concepts for retrieving the ideal answers (i.e., paragraph-sized
    summaries). Preliminary results show that our system achieves good and competitive
    results in both exact and ideal answers extraction tasks as compared with the
    participating systems.

  abstract: Word embeddings are a crucial component in modern NLP. Pre-trained embeddings
    released by different groups have been a major reason for their popularity. However,
    they are trained on generic corpora, which limits their direct use for domain
    specific tasks. In this paper, we propose a method to add task specific information
    to pre-trained word embeddings. Such information can improve their utility. We
    add information from medical coding data, as well as the first level from the
    hierarchy of ICD-10 medical code set to different pre-trained word embeddings.
    We adapt CBOW algorithm from the word2vec package for our purpose. We evaluated
    our approach on five different pre-trained word embeddings. Both the original
    word embeddings, and their modified versions (the ones with added information)
    were used for automated review of medical coding. The modified word embeddings
    give an improvement in f-score by 1% on the 5-fold evaluation on a private medical
    claims dataset. Our results show that adding extra information is possible and
    beneficial for the task at hand.

  abstract: Many tasks in the biomedical domain require the assignment of one or more
    predefined labels to input text, where the labels are a part of a hierarchical
    structure (such as a taxonomy). The conventional approach is to use a one-vs.-rest
    (OVR) classification setup, where a binary classifier is trained for each label
    in the taxonomy or ontology where all instances not belonging to the class are
    considered negative examples. The main drawbacks to this approach are that dependencies
    between classes are not leveraged in the training and classification process,
    and the additional computational cost of training parallel classifiers. In this
    paper, we apply a new method for hierarchical multi-label text classification
    that initializes a neural network model final hidden layer such that it leverages
    label co-occurrence relations such as hypernymy. This approach elegantly lends
    itself to hierarchical classification. We evaluated this approach using two hierarchical
    multi-label text classification tasks in the biomedical domain using both sentence-
    and document-level classification. Our evaluation shows promising results for
    this approach.

  abstract: Biomedical events describe complex interactions between various biomedical
    entities. Event trigger is a word or a phrase which typically signifies the occurrence
    of an event. Event trigger identification is an important first step in all event
    extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either rely on complex
    hand-crafted features or consider features only within a window. In this paper
    we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent neural network (RNN)
    to extract higher level features present across the sentence. Thus hidden state
    representation of RNN along with word and entity type embedding as features avoid
    relying on the complex hand-crafted features generated using various NLP toolkits.
    Our experiments have shown to achieve state-of-art F1-score on Multi Level Event
    Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have also performed category-wise analysis of the
    result and discussed the importance of various features in trigger identification
    task.

  abstract: Token sequences are often used as the input for Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNNs) in natural language processing. However, they might not be an ideal representation
    for time expressions, which are long, highly varied, and semantically complex.
    We describe a method for representing time expressions with single pseudo-tokens
    for CNNs. With this method, we establish a new state-of-the-art result for a clinical
    temporal relation extraction task.

  abstract: Diagnosis autocoding services and research intend to both improve the
    productivity of clinical coders and the accuracy of the coding. It is an important
    step in data analysis for funding and reimbursement, as well as health services
    planning and resource allocation. We investigate the applicability of deep learning
    at autocoding of radiology reports using International Classification of Diseases
    (ICD). Deep learning methods are known to require large training data. Our goal
    is to explore how to use these methods when the training data is sparse, skewed
    and relatively small, and how their effectiveness compares to conventional methods.
    We identify optimal parameters that could be used in setting up a convolutional
    neural network for autocoding with comparable results to that of conventional
    methods.

  abstract: Question answering (QA) can support physicians and biomedical researchers
    to find answers to their questions in the scientific literature. Such systems
    process large collections of documents in real time and include many natural language
    processing (NLP) procedures. We recently developed Olelo, a QA system for biomedicine
    which includes various NLP components, such as question processing, document and
    passage retrieval, answer processing and multi-document summarization. In this
    work, we present an evaluation of our system on the the fifth BioASQ challenge.
    We participated with the current state of the application and with an extension
    based on semantic role labeling that we are currently investigating. In addition
    to the BioASQ evaluation, we compared our system to other on-line biomedical QA
    systems in terms of the response time and the quality of the answers.

  abstract: Event detection from clinical notes has been traditionally solved with
    rule based and statistical natural language processing (NLP) approaches that require
    extensive domain knowledge and feature engineering. In this paper, we have explored
    the feasibility of approaching this task with recurrent neural networks, clinical
    word embeddings and introduced a hybrid architecture to improve detection for
    entities with smaller representation in the dataset. A comparative analysis is
    also done which reveals the complementary behavior of neural networks and conditional
    random fields in clinical entity detection.

  abstract: "In this paper, we describe a system for automatic construction of user\
    \ disease progression timelines from their posts in online support groups using\
    \ minimal supervision. In recent years, several online support groups have been\
    \ established which has led to a huge increase in the amount of patient-authored\
    \ text available. Creating systems which can automatically extract important medical\
    \ events and create disease progression timelines for users from such text can\
    \ help in patient health monitoring as well as studying links between medical\
    \ events and users\u2019 participation in support groups. Prior work in this domain\
    \ has used manually constructed keyword sets to detect medical events. In this\
    \ work, our aim is to perform medical event detection using minimal supervision\
    \ in order to develop a more general timeline construction system. Our system\
    \ achieves an accuracy of 55.17%, which is 92% of the performance achieved by\
    \ a supervised baseline system."

  abstract: We study and compare two different approaches to the task of automatic
    assignment of predefined classes to clinical free-text narratives. In the first
    approach this is treated as a traditional mention-level named-entity recognition
    task, while the second approach treats it as a sentence-level multi-label classification
    task. Performance comparison across these two approaches is conducted in the form
    of sentence-level evaluation and state-of-the-art methods for both approaches
    are evaluated. The experiments are done on two data sets consisting of Finnish
    clinical text, manually annotated with respect to the topics pain and acute confusion.
    Our results suggest that the mention-level named-entity recognition approach outperforms
    sentence-level classification overall, but the latter approach still manages to
    achieve the best prediction scores on several annotation classes.

  abstract: This paper describes the participation of USTB_PRIR team in the 2017 BioASQ
    5B on question answering, including document retrieval, snippet retrieval, and
    concept retrieval task. We introduce different multimodal query processing strategies
    to enrich query terms and assign different weights to them. Specifically, sequential
    dependence model (SDM), pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), fielded sequential dependence
    model (FSDM) and Divergence from Randomness model (DFRM) are respectively performed
    on different fields of PubMed articles, sentences extracted from relevant articles,
    the five terminologies or ontologies (MeSH, GO, Jochem, Uniprot and DO) to achieve
    better search performances. Preliminary results show that our systems outperform
    others in the document and snippet retrieval task in the first two batches.

  abstract: Authorship attribution is a natural language processing task that has
    been widely studied, often by considering small order statistics. In this paper,
    we explore a complex network approach to assign the authorship of texts based
    on their mesoscopic representation, in an attempt to capture the flow of the narrative.
    Indeed, as reported in this work, such an approach allowed the identification
    of the dominant narrative structure of the studied authors. This has been achieved
    due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into account relationships
    between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the text, which is able
    to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed approach has been illustrated
    through principal component analysis, a comparison with the chance baseline method,
    and network visualization. Such visualizations reveal individual characteristics
    of the authors, which can be understood as a kind of calligraphy.

  abstract: Word senses are not static and may have temporal, spatial or corpus-specific
    scopes. Identifying such scopes might benefit the existing WSD systems largely.
    In this paper, while studying corpus specific word senses, we adapt three existing
    predominant and novel-sense discovery algorithms to identify these corpus-specific
    senses. We make use of text data available in the form of millions of digitized
    books and newspaper archives as two different sources of corpora and propose automated
    methods to identify corpus-specific word senses at various time points. We conduct
    an extensive and thorough human judgement experiment to rigorously evaluate and
    compare the performance of these approaches. Post adaptation, the output of the
    three algorithms are in the same format and the accuracy results are also comparable,
    with roughly 45-60% of the reported corpus-specific senses being judged as genuine.

  abstract: 'Recently, different systems which learn to populate and extend a knowledge
    base (KB) from the web in different languages have been presented. Although a
    large set of concepts should be learnt independently from the language used to
    read, there are facts which are expected to be more easily gathered in local language
    (e.g., culture or geography). A system that merges KBs learnt in different languages
    will benefit from the complementary information as long as common beliefs are
    identified, as well as from redundancy present in web pages written in different
    languages. In this paper, we deal with the problem of identifying equivalent beliefs
    (or concepts) across language specific KBs, assuming that they share the same
    ontology of categories and relations. In a case study with two KBs independently
    learnt from different inputs, namely web pages written in English and web pages
    written in Portuguese respectively, we report on the results of two methodologies:
    an approach based on personalized PageRank and an inference technique to find
    out common relevant paths through the KBs. The proposed inference technique efficiently
    identifies relevant paths, outperforming the baseline (a dictionary-based classifier)
    in the vast majority of tested categories.'

  abstract: Word embeddings are high-dimensional vector representations of words and
    are thus difficult to interpret. In order to deal with this, we introduce an unsupervised
    parameter free method for creating a hierarchical graphical clustering of the
    full ensemble of word vectors and show that this structure is a geometrically
    meaningful representation of the original relations between the words. This newly
    obtained representation can be used for better understanding and thus improving
    the embedding algorithm and exhibits semantic meaning, so it can also be utilized
    in a variety of language processing tasks like categorization or measuring similarity.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for multimodal word embedding,
    which exploit a generalized framework of multi-view spectral graph embedding to
    take into account visual appearances or scenes denoted by words in a corpus. We
    evaluated our method through word similarity tasks and a concept-to-image search
    task, having found that it provides word representations that reflect visual information,
    while somewhat trading-off the performance on the word similarity tasks. Moreover,
    we demonstrate that our method captures multimodal linguistic regularities, which
    enable recovering relational similarities between words and images by vector arithmetics.

  abstract: This paper introduces a new, graph-based view of the data of the FrameNet
    project, which we hope will make it easier to understand the mixture of semantic
    and syntactic information contained in FrameNet annotation. We show how English
    FrameNet and other Frame Semantic resources can be represented as sets of interconnected
    graphs of frames, frame elements, semantic types, and annotated instances of them
    in text. We display examples of the new graphical representation based on the
    annotations, which combine Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar, thus capturing
    most of the syntax and semantics of each sentence. We consider how graph theory
    could help researchers to make better use of FrameNet data for tasks such as automatic
    Frame Semantic role labeling, paraphrasing, and translation. Finally, we describe
    the development of FrameNet-like lexical resources for other languages in the
    current Multilingual FrameNet project. which seeks to discover cross-lingual alignments,
    both in the lexicon (for frames and lexical units within frames) and across parallel
    or comparable texts. We conclude with an example showing graphically the semantic
    and syntactic similarities and differences between parallel sentences in English
    and Japanese. We will release software for displaying such graphs from the current
    data releases.

  abstract: In this work, we aim at developing an extractive summarizer in the multi-document
    setting. We implement a rank based sentence selection using continuous vector
    representations along with key-phrases. Furthermore, we propose a model to tackle
    summary coherence for increasing readability. We conduct experiments on the Document
    Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004 datasets using ROUGE toolkit. Our experiments
    demonstrate that the methods bring significant improvements over the state of
    the art methods in terms of informativity and coherence.

  abstract: "In this paper, we present an empirical study of email classification\
    \ into two main categories \u201CBusiness\u201D and \u201CPersonal\u201D. We train\
    \ on the Enron email corpus, and test on the Enron and Avocado email corpora.\
    \ We show that information from the email exchange networks improves the performance\
    \ of classification. We represent the email exchange networks as social networks\
    \ with graph structures. For this classification task, we extract social networks\
    \ features from the graphs in addition to lexical features from email content\
    \ and we compare the performance of SVM and Extra-Trees classifiers using these\
    \ features. Combining graph features with lexical features improves the performance\
    \ on both classifiers. We also provide manually annotated sets of the Avocado\
    \ and Enron email corpora as a supplementary contribution."

  abstract: Derivational nouns are widely used in Sanskrit corpora and represent an
    important cornerstone of productivity in the language. Currently there exists
    no analyser that identifies the derivational nouns. We propose a semi supervised
    approach for identification of derivational nouns in Sanskrit. We not only identify
    the derivational words, but also link them to their corresponding source words.
    Our novelty comes in the design of the network structure for the task. The edge
    weights are featurised based on the phonetic, morphological, syntactic and the
    semantic similarity shared between the words to be identified. We find that our
    model is effective for the task, even when we employ a labelled dataset which
    is only 5 % to that of the entire dataset.

  abstract: Coherence is a crucial feature of text because it is indispensable for
    conveying its communication purpose and meaning to its readers. In this paper,
    we propose an unsupervised text coherence scoring based on graph construction
    in which edges are established between semantically similar sentences represented
    by vertices. The sentence similarity is calculated based on the cosine similarity
    of semantic vectors representing sentences. We provide three graph construction
    methods establishing an edge from a given vertex to a preceding adjacent vertex,
    to a single similar vertex, or to multiple similar vertices. We evaluated our
    methods in the document discrimination task and the insertion task by comparing
    our proposed methods to the supervised (Entity Grid) and unsupervised (Entity
    Graph) baselines. In the document discrimination task, our method outperformed
    the unsupervised baseline but could not do the supervised baseline, while in the
    insertion task, our method outperformed both baselines.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel two step algorithm for sentence alignment
    in monolingual corpora using Unfolding Recursive Autoencoders. First, we use unfolding
    recursive auto-encoders (RAE) to learn feature vectors for phrases in syntactical
    tree of the sentence. To compare two sentences we use a similarity matrix which
    has dimensions proportional to the size of the two sentences. Since the similarity
    matrix generated to compare two sentences has varying dimension due to different
    sentence lengths, a dynamic pooling layer is used to map it to a matrix of fixed
    dimension. The resulting matrix is used to calculate the similarity scores between
    the two sentences. The second step of the algorithm captures the contexts in which
    the sentences occur in the document by using a dynamic programming algorithm for
    global alignment.

  abstract: With the advent of informal electronic communications such as social media,
    colloquial languages that were historically unwritten are being written for the
    first time in heavily code-switched environments. We present a method for inducing
    portions of translation lexicons through the use of expert knowledge in these
    settings where there are approximately zero resources available other than a language
    informant, potentially not even large amounts of monolingual data. We investigate
    inducing a Moroccan Darija-English translation lexicon via French loanwords bridging
    into English and find that a useful lexicon is induced for human-assisted translation
    and statistical machine translation.

  abstract: Twitter has become a rich source for linguistic data. Here, a possibility
    of building a trilingual Latvian-Russian-English corpus of tweets from Riga, Latvia
    is investigated. Such a corpus, once constructed, might be of great use for multiple
    purposes including training machine translation models, examining cross-lingual
    phenomena and studying the population of Riga. This pilot study shows that it
    is feasible to build such a resource by collecting and analysing a pilot corpus,
    which is made publicly available and can be used to construct a large comparable
    corpus.

  abstract: Parallel collections of documents are crucial resources for training and
    evaluating machine translation (MT) systems. Even though large collections are
    available for certain domains and language pairs, these are still scarce in the
    biomedical domain. We developed a parallel corpus of clinical trials in Portuguese
    and English. The documents are derived from the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry
    and the corpus currently contains a total of 1188 documents. In this paper, we
    describe the corpus construction and discuss the quality of the translation and
    the sentence alignment that we obtained.

    system identifies parallel sentence pairs in Chinese-English comparable corpora
    by translating word-by-word Chinese sentences into English, using the search engine
    Solr to select near-parallel sentences and then by using an SVM classifier to
    identify true parallel sentences from the previous results. It obtains an F1-score
    of 45% (resp. 32%) on the test (training) set.

  abstract: A Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system is always trained using
    large parallel corpus to produce effective translation. Not only is the corpus
    scarce, it also involves a lot of manual labor and cost. Parallel corpus can be
    prepared by employing comparable corpora where a pair of corpora is in two different
    languages pointing to the same domain. In the present work, we try to build a
    parallel corpus for French-English language pair from a given comparable corpus.
    The data and the problem set are provided as part of the shared task organized
    by BUCC 2017. We have proposed a system that first translates the sentences by
    heavily relying on Moses and then group the sentences based on sentence length
    similarity. Finally, the one to one sentence selection was done based on Cosine
    Similarity algorithm.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the BUCC 2017 shared task on parallel sentence extraction
    from comparable corpora. It recalls the design of the datasets, presents their
    final construction and statistics and the methods used to evaluate system results.
    13 runs were submitted to the shared task by 4 teams, covering three of the four
    proposed language pairs: French-English (7 runs), German-English (3 runs), and
    Chinese-English (3 runs). The best F-scores as measured against the gold standard
    were 0.84 (German-English), 0.80 (French-English), and 0.43 (Chinese-English).
    Because of the design of the dataset, in which not all gold parallel sentence
    pairs are known, these are only minimum values. We examined manually a small sample
    of the false negative sentence pairs for the most precise French-English runs
    and estimated the number of parallel sentence pairs not yet in the provided gold
    standard. Adding them to the gold standard leads to revised estimates for the
    French-English F-scores of at most +1.5pt. This suggests that the BUCC 2017 datasets
    provide a reasonable approximate evaluation of the parallel sentence spotting
    task.'

  abstract: "Little attention has been paid to distributional compositional methods\
    \ which employ syntactically structured vector models. As word vectors belonging\
    \ to different syntactic categories have incompatible syntactic distributions,\
    \ no trivial compositional operation can be applied to combine them into a new\
    \ compositional vector. In this article, we generalize the method described by\
    \ Erk and Pad\xF3 (2009) by proposing a dependency-base framework that contextualize\
    \ not only lemmas but also selectional preferences. The main contribution of the\
    \ article is to expand their model to a fully compositional framework in which\
    \ syntactic dependencies are put at the core of semantic composition. We claim\
    \ that semantic composition is mainly driven by syntactic dependencies. Each syntactic\
    \ dependency generates two new compositional vectors representing the contextualized\
    \ sense of the two related lemmas. The sequential application of the compositional\
    \ operations associated to the dependencies results in as many contextualized\
    \ vectors as lemmas the composite expression contains. At the end of the semantic\
    \ process, we do not obtain a single compositional vector representing the semantic\
    \ denotation of the whole composite expression, but one contextualized vector\
    \ for each lemma of the whole expression. Our method avoids the troublesome high-order\
    \ tensor representations by defining lemmas and selectional restrictions as first-order\
    \ tensors (i.e. standard vectors). A corpus-based experiment is performed to both\
    \ evaluate the quality of the compositional vectors built with our strategy, and\
    \ to compare them to other approaches on distributional compositional semantics.\
    \ The experiments show that our dependency-based compositional method performs\
    \ as (or even better than) the state-of-the-art."

  abstract: "With a strikingly simple architecture and the ability to learn meaningful\
    \ word embeddings efficiently from texts containing billions of words, word2vec\
    \ remains one of the most popular neural language models used today. However,\
    \ as only a single embedding is learned for every word in the vocabulary, the\
    \ model fails to optimally represent words with multiple meanings and, additionally,\
    \ it is not possible to create embeddings for new (out-of-vocabulary) words on\
    \ the spot. Based on an intuitive interpretation of the continuous bag-of-words\
    \ (CBOW) word2vec model\u2019s negative sampling training objective in terms of\
    \ predicting context based similarities, we motivate an extension of the model\
    \ we call context encoders (ConEc). By multiplying the matrix of trained word2vec\
    \ embeddings with a word\u2019s average context vector, out-of-vocabulary (OOV)\
    \ embeddings and representations for words with multiple meanings can be created\
    \ based on the words\u2019 local contexts. The benefits of this approach are illustrated\
    \ by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition\

  abstract: We propose a recurrent neural model that generates natural-language questions
    from documents, conditioned on answers. We show how to train the model using a
    combination of supervised and reinforcement learning. After teacher forcing for
    standard maximum likelihood training, we fine-tune the model using policy gradient
    techniques to maximize several rewards that measure question quality. Most notably,
    one of these rewards is the performance of a question-answering system. We motivate
    question generation as a means to improve the performance of question answering
    systems. Our model is trained and evaluated on the recent question-answering dataset
    SQuAD.

  abstract: Word representation models have achieved great success in natural language
    processing tasks, such as relation classification. However, it does not always
    work on informal text, and the morphemes of some misspelling words may carry important
    short-distance semantic information. We propose a hybrid model, combining the
    merits of word-level and character-level representations to learn better representations
    on informal text. Experiments on two dataset of relation classification, SemEval-2010
    Task8 and a large-scale one we compile from informal text, show that our model
    achieves a competitive result in the former and state-of-the-art with the other.

  abstract: The goal of semantic parsing is to map natural language to a machine interpretable
    meaning representation language (MRL). One of the constraints that limits full
    exploration of deep learning technologies for semantic parsing is the lack of
    sufficient annotation training data. In this paper, we propose using sequence-to-sequence
    in a multi-task setup for semantic parsing with focus on transfer learning. We
    explore three multi-task architectures for sequence-to-sequence model and compare
    their performance with the independently trained model. Our experiments show that
    the multi-task setup aids transfer learning from an auxiliary task with large
    labeled data to the target task with smaller labeled data. We see an absolute
    accuracy gain ranging from 1.0% to 4.4% in in our in-house data set and we also
    see good gains ranging from 2.5% to 7.0% on the ATIS semantic parsing tasks with
    syntactic and semantic auxiliary tasks.

  abstract: Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing
    relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of learning
    embeddings from multi-step relations. However, due to the size of knowledge bases,
    learning multi-step relations directly on top of observed triplets could be costly.
    Hence, a manually designed procedure is often used when training the models. In
    this paper, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), which is designed to perform
    multi-step inference implicitly through a controller and shared memory. Without
    a human-designed inference procedure, IRNs use training data to learn to perform
    multi-step inference in an embedding neural space through the shared memory and
    controller. While the inference procedure does not explicitly operate on top of
    observed triplets, our proposed model outperforms all previous approaches on the
    popular FB15k benchmark by more than 5.7%.

  abstract: 'Many domain adaptation approaches rely on learning cross domain shared
    representations to transfer the knowledge learned in one domain to other domains.
    Traditional domain adaptation only considers adapting for one task. In this paper,
    we explore multi-task representation learning under the domain adaptation scenario.
    We propose a neural network framework that supports domain adaptation for multiple
    tasks simultaneously, and learns shared representations that better generalize
    for domain adaptation. We apply the proposed framework to domain adaptation for
    sequence tagging problems considering two tasks: Chinese word segmentation and
    named entity recognition. Experiments show that multi-task domain adaptation works
    better than disjoint domain adaptation for each task, and achieves the state-of-the-art
    results for both tasks in the social media domain.'

  abstract: Word embeddings, which represent a word as a point in a vector space,
    have become ubiquitous to several NLP tasks. A recent line of work uses bilingual
    (two languages) corpora to learn a different vector for each sense of a word,
    by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense identification. We present a multi-view
    Bayesian non-parametric algorithm which improves multi-sense wor d embeddings
    by (a) using multilingual (i.e., more than two languages) corpora to significantly
    improve sense embeddings beyond what one achieves with bilingual information,
    and (b) uses a principled approach to learn a variable number of senses per word,
    in a data-driven manner. Ours is the first approach with the ability to leverage
    multilingual corpora efficiently for multi-sense representation learning. Experiments
    show that multilingual training significantly improves performance over monolingual
    and bilingual training, by allowing us to combine different parallel corpora to
    leverage multilingual context. Multilingual training yields comparable performance
    to a state of the art monolingual model trained on five times more training data.

    \ In DocTag2Vec, we simultaneously learn the representation of words, documents,\

  abstract: 'Recently Le & Mikolov described two log-linear models, called Paragraph
    Vector, that can be used to learn state-of-the-art distributed representations
    of documents. Inspired by this work, we present Binary Paragraph Vector models:
    simple neural networks that learn short binary codes for fast information retrieval.
    We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based binary codes,
    despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning
    settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training
    corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that binary paragraph vectors
    can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents. Finally,
    we present a model that simultaneously learns short binary codes and longer, real-valued
    representations. This model can be used to rapidly retrieve a short list of highly
    relevant documents from a large document collection.'

  abstract: A novel character-level neural language model is proposed in this paper.
    The proposed model incorporates a biologically inspired temporal hierarchy in
    the architecture for representing multiple compositions of language in order to
    handle longer sequences for the character-level language model. The temporal hierarchy
    is introduced in the language model by utilizing a Gated Recurrent Neural Network
    with multiple timescales. The proposed model incorporates a timescale adaptation
    mechanism for enhancing the performance of the language model. We evaluate our
    proposed model using the popular Penn Treebank and Text8 corpora. The experiments
    show that the use of multiple timescales in a Neural Language Model (NLM) enables
    improved performance despite having fewer parameters and with no additional computation
    requirements. Our experiments also demonstrate the ability of the adaptive temporal
    hierarchies to represent multiple compositonality without the help of complex
    hierarchical architectures and shows that better representation of the longer
    sequences lead to enhanced performance of the probabilistic language model.

  abstract: "Automatic completion of frame-to-frame (F2F) relations in the FrameNet\
    \ (FN) hierarchy has received little attention, although they incorporate meta-level\
    \ commonsense knowledge and are used in downstream approaches. We address the\
    \ problem of sparsely annotated F2F relations. First, we examine whether the manually\
    \ defined F2F relations emerge from text by learning text-based frame embeddings.\
    \ Our analysis reveals insights about the difficulty of reconstructing F2F relations\
    \ purely from text. Second, we present different systems for predicting F2F relations;\
    \ our best-performing one uses the FN hierarchy to train on and to ground embeddings\
    \ in. A comparison of systems and embeddings exposes the crucial influence of\
    \ knowledge-based embeddings to a system\u2019s performance in predicting F2F\
    \ relations."

  abstract: In this paper, we use the framework of neural machine translation to learn
    joint sentence representations across six very different languages. Our aim is
    that a representation which is independent of the language, is likely to capture
    the underlying semantics. We define a new cross-lingual similarity measure, compare
    up to 1.4M sentence representations and study the characteristics of close sentences.
    We provide experimental evidence that sentences that are close in embedding space
    are indeed semantically highly related, but often have quite different structure
    and syntax. These relations also hold when comparing sentences in different languages.

  abstract: "End-to-end training of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems requires\
    \ massive data and compute resources. We explore transfer learning based on model\

  abstract: Learning word representations to capture the semantics and compositionality
    of language has received much research interest in natural language processing.
    Beyond the popular vector space models, matrix representations for words have
    been proposed, since then, matrix multiplication can serve as natural composition
    operation. In this work, we investigate the problem of learning matrix representations
    of words. We present a learning approach for compositional matrix-space models
    for the task of sentiment analysis. We show that our approach, which learns the
    matrices gradually in two steps, outperforms other approaches and a gradient-descent
    baseline in terms of quality and computational cost.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of densely connected layers
    into recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our proposed architecture on the Penn
    Treebank language modeling task. We show that we can obtain similar perplexity
    scores with six times fewer parameters compared to a standard stacked 2-layer
    LSTM model trained with dropout (Zaremba et al., 2014). In contrast with the current
    usage of skip connections, we show that densely connecting only a few stacked
    layers with skip connections already yields significant perplexity reductions.

  abstract: We present NewsQA, a challenging machine comprehension dataset of over
    100,000 human-generated question-answer pairs. Crowdworkers supply questions and
    answers based on a set of over 10,000 news articles from CNN, with answers consisting
    of spans of text in the articles. We collect this dataset through a four-stage
    process designed to solicit exploratory questions that require reasoning. Analysis
    confirms that NewsQA demands abilities beyond simple word matching and recognizing
    textual entailment. We measure human performance on the dataset and compare it
    to several strong neural models. The performance gap between humans and machines
    (13.3% F1) indicates that significant progress can be made on NewsQA through future
    research. The dataset is freely available online.

  abstract: "Language in social media is a dynamic system, constantly evolving and\
    \ adapting, with words and concepts rapidly emerging, disappearing, and changing\
    \ their meaning. These changes can be estimated using word representations in\
    \ context, over time and across locations. A number of methods have been proposed\
    \ to track these spatiotemporal changes but no general method exists to evaluate\
    \ the quality of these representations. Previous work largely focused on qualitative\
    \ evaluation, which we improve by proposing a set of visualizations that highlight\
    \ changes in text representation over both space and time. We demonstrate usefulness\
    \ of novel spatiotemporal representations to explore and characterize specific\
    \ aspects of the corpus of tweets collected from European countries over a two-week\
    \ period centered around the terrorist attacks in Brussels in March 2016. In addition,\
    \ we quantitatively evaluate spatiotemporal representations by feeding them into\
    \ a downstream classification task \u2013 event type prediction. Thus, our work\
    \ is the first to provide both intrinsic (qualitative) and extrinsic (quantitative)\
    \ evaluation of text representations for spatiotemporal trends."

  abstract: Recently, resources and tasks were proposed to go beyond state tracking
    in dialogue systems. An example is the frame tracking task, which requires recording
    multiple frames, one for each user goal set during the dialogue. This allows a
    user, for instance, to compare items corresponding to different goals. This paper
    proposes a model which takes as input the list of frames created so far during
    the dialogue, the current user utterance as well as the dialogue acts, slot types,
    and slot values associated with this utterance. The model then outputs the frame
    being referenced by each triple of dialogue act, slot type, and slot value. We
    show that on the recently published Frames dataset, this model significantly outperforms
    a previously proposed rule-based baseline. In addition, we propose an extensive
    analysis of the frame tracking task by dividing it into sub-tasks and assessing
    their difficulty with respect to our model.

  abstract: We investigate the pertinence of methods from algebraic topology for text
    data analysis. These methods enable the development of mathematically-principled
    isometric-invariant mappings from a set of vectors to a document embedding, which
    is stable with respect to the geometry of the document in the selected metric
    space. In this work, we evaluate the utility of these topology-based document
    representations in traditional NLP tasks, specifically document clustering and
    sentiment classification. We find that the embeddings do not benefit text analysis.
    In fact, performance is worse than simple techniques like tf-idf, indicating that
    the geometry of the document does not provide enough variability for classification
    on the basis of topic or sentiment in the chosen datasets.

  abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gathered a lot of attention
    from the computer vision community, yielding impressive results for image generation.
    Advances in the adversarial generation of natural language from noise however
    are not commensurate with the progress made in generating images, and still lag
    far behind likelihood based methods. In this paper, we take a step towards generating
    natural language with a GAN objective alone. We introduce a simple baseline that
    addresses the discrete output space problem without relying on gradient estimators
    and show that it is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a Chinese poem
    generation dataset. We present quantitative results on generating sentences from
    context-free and probabilistic context-free grammars, and qualitative language
    modeling results. A conditional version is also described that can generate sequences
    conditioned on sentence characteristics.

  abstract: 'Deep neural networks have advanced the state of the art in named entity
    recognition. However, under typical training procedures, advantages over classical
    methods emerge only with large datasets. As a result, deep learning is employed
    only when large public datasets or a large budget for manually labeling data is
    available. In this work, we show otherwise: by combining deep learning with active
    learning, we can outperform classical methods even with a significantly smaller
    amount of training data.'

  abstract: Many recent advances in deep learning for natural language processing
    have come at increasing computational cost, but the power of these state-of-the-art
    models is not needed for every example in a dataset. We demonstrate two approaches
    to reducing unnecessary computation in cases where a fast but weak baseline classier
    and a stronger, slower model are both available. Applying an AUC-based metric
    to the task of sentiment classification, we find significant efficiency gains
    with both a probability-threshold method for reducing computational cost and one
    that uses a secondary decision network.

  abstract: We present models for embedding words in the context of surrounding words.
    Such models, which we refer to as token embeddings, represent the characteristics
    of a word that are specific to a given context, such as word sense, syntactic
    category, and semantic role. We explore simple, efficient token embedding models
    based on standard neural network architectures. We learn token embeddings on a
    large amount of unannotated text and evaluate them as features for part-of-speech
    taggers and dependency parsers trained on much smaller amounts of annotated data.
    We find that predictors endowed with token embeddings consistently outperform
    baseline predictors across a range of context window and training set sizes.

  abstract: We propose a method to aggregate and organize a large, multi-source dataset
    of news articles into a collection of major stories, and automatically name and
    visualize these stories in a working system. The approach is able to run online,
    as new articles are added, processing 4 million news articles from 20 news sources,
    and extracting 80000 major stories, some of which span several years. The visual
    interface consists of lanes of timelines, each annotated with information that
    is deemed important for the story, including extracted quotations. The working
    system allows a user to search and navigate 8 years of story information.

  abstract: 'Detecting events from social media data has important applications in
    public security, political issues, and public health. Many studies have focused
    on detecting specific or unspecific events from Twitter streams. However, not
    much attention has been paid to detecting changes, and their impact, in online
    conversations related to an event. We propose methods for detecting such changes,
    using clustering of temporal profiles of hashtags, and three change point detection
    algorithms. The methods were tested on two Twitter datasets: one covering the
    2014 Ottawa shooting event, and one covering the Sochi winter Olympics. We compare
    our approach to a baseline consisting of detecting change from raw counts in the
    conversation. We show that our method produces large gains in change detection
    accuracy on both datasets.'

  abstract: Recent methods for Event Detection focus on Deep Learning for automatic
    feature generation and feature ranking. However, most of those approaches fail
    to exploit rich semantic information, which results in relatively poor recall.
    This paper is a small & focused contribution, where we introduce an Event Detection
    and classification system, based on deep semantic information retrieved from a
    frame-semantic parser. Our experiments show that our system achieves higher recall
    than state-of-the-art systems. Further, we claim that enhancing our system with
    deep learning techniques like feature ranking can achieve even better results,
    as it can benefit from both approaches.

  abstract: Event knowledge represents the knowledge of causal and temporal relations
    between events. Shared arguments of event knowledge encode patterns of role shifting
    in successive events. A two-stage framework was proposed for the task of Japanese
    event knowledge acquisition, in which related event pairs are first extracted,
    and shared arguments are then identified to form the complete event knowledge.
    This paper focuses on the second stage of this framework, and proposes a method
    to improve the shared argument identification of related event pairs. We constructed
    a gold dataset for shared argument learning. By evaluating our system on this
    gold dataset, we found that our proposed model outperformed the baseline models
    by a large margin.

  abstract: We present an approach at identifying a specific class of events, movement
    action events (MAEs), in a data set that consists of ca. 2,800 personal letters
    exchanged by the German architect Erich Mendelsohn and his wife, Luise. A backend
    system uses these and other semantic analysis results as input for an authoring
    environment that digital curators can use to produce new pieces of digital content.
    In our example case, the human expert will receive recommendations from the system
    with the goal of putting together a travelogue, i.e., a description of the trips
    and journeys undertaken by the couple. We describe the components and architecture
    and also apply the system to news data.

  abstract: 'Human understanding of narrative is mainly driven by reasoning about
    causal relations between events and thus recognizing them is a key capability
    for computational models of language understanding. Computational work in this
    area has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a
    knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to
    understand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this
    position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that newswire
    is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations between
    everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method to learn
    causal relations between events in the narrative genres of first-person narratives
    and film scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal
    relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80% of the time. We also
    demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available event-pair
    datasets extracted from newswire.'

  abstract: "With growing interest in automated event extraction, there is an increasing\
    \ need to overcome the labor costs of hand-written event templates, entity lists,\
    \ and annotated corpora. In the last few years, more inductive approaches have\
    \ emerged, seeking to discover unknown event types and roles in raw text. The\
    \ main recent efforts use probabilistic generative models, as in topic modeling,\
    \ which are formally concise but do not always yield stable or easily interpretable\
    \ results. We argue that event schema induction can benefit from greater structure\
    \ in the process and in linguistic features that distinguish words\u2019 functions\
    \ and themes. To maximize our use of limited data, we reverse the typical schema\
    \ induction steps and introduce new similarity measures, building an intuitive\
    \ process for inducing the structure of unknown events."

  abstract: This paper reports on the Event StoryLine Corpus (ESC) v1.0, a new benchmark
    dataset for the temporal and causal relation detection. By developing this dataset,
    we also introduce a new task, the StoryLine Extraction from news data, which aims
    at extracting and classifying events relevant for stories, from across news documents
    spread in time and clustered around a single seminal event or topic. In addition
    to describing the dataset, we also report on three baselines systems whose results
    show the complexity of the task and suggest directions for the development of
    more robust systems.

  abstract: In this paper we describe a new lexical semantic resource, The Rich Event
    On-tology, which provides an independent conceptual backbone to unify existing
    semantic role labeling (SRL) schemas and augment them with event-to-event causal
    and temporal relations. By unifying the FrameNet, VerbNet, Automatic Content Extraction,
    and Rich Entities, Relations and Events resources, the ontology serves as a shared
    hub for the disparate annotation schemas and therefore enables the combination
    of SRL training data into a larger, more diverse corpus. By adding temporal and
    causal relational information not found in any of the independent resources, the
    ontology facilitates reasoning on and across documents, revealing relationships
    between events that come together in temporal and causal chains to build more
    complex scenarios. We envision the open resource serving as a valuable tool for
    both moving from the ontology to text to query for event types and scenarios of
    interest, and for moving from text to the ontology to access interpretations of
    events using the combined semantic information housed there.

  abstract: Storyline research links together events in stories and specifies shared
    participants in those stories. In these analyses, an atomic event is assumed to
    be a single clause headed by a single verb. However, many analyses of verbal semantics
    assume a decompositional analysis of events expressed in single clauses. We present
    a formalization of a decompositional analysis of events in which each participant
    in a clausal event has their own temporally extended subevent, and the subevents
    are related through causal and other interactions. This decomposition allows us
    to represent storylines as an evolving set of interactions between participants
    over time.

  abstract: This paper describes how language is grounded by a comprehension system
    called Lucia within a robotic agent called Rosie that can manipulate objects and
    navigate indoors. The whole system is built within the Soar cognitive architecture
    and uses Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG) as a formalism for describing linguistic
    knowledge. Grounding is performed using knowledge from the grammar itself, from
    the linguistic context, from the agents perception, and from an ontology of long-term
    knowledge about object categories and properties and actions the agent can perform.
    The paper also describes a benchmark corpus of 200 sentences in this domain along
    with test versions of the world model and ontology and gold-standard meanings
    for each of the sentences. The benchmark is contained in the supplemental materials.

  abstract: "Multi-modal grounded language learning connects language predicates to\
    \ physical properties of objects in the world. Sensing with multiple modalities,\
    \ such as audio, haptics, and visual colors and shapes while performing interaction\
    \ behaviors like lifting, dropping, and looking on objects enables a robot to\
    \ ground non-visual predicates like \u201Cempty\u201D as well as visual predicates\
    \ like \u201Cred\u201D. Previous work has established that grounding in multi-modal\
    \ space improves performance on object retrieval from human descriptions. In this\
    \ work, we gather behavior annotations from humans and demonstrate that these\
    \ improve language grounding performance by allowing a system to focus on relevant\
    \ behaviors for words like \u201Cwhite\u201D or \u201Chalf-full\u201D that can\
    \ be understood by looking or lifting, respectively. We also explore adding modality\
    \ annotations (whether to focus on audio or haptics when performing a behavior),\
    \ which improves performance, and sharing information between linguistically related\
    \ predicates (if \u201Cgreen\u201D is a color, \u201Cwhite\u201D is a color),\
    \ which improves grounding recall but at the cost of precision."

  abstract: 'Service robots are expected to operate in specific environments, where
    the presence of humans plays a key role. A major feature of such robotics platforms
    is thus the ability to react to spoken commands. This requires the understanding
    of the user utterance with an accuracy able to trigger the robot reaction. Such
    correct interpretation of linguistic exchanges depends on physical, cognitive
    and language-dependent aspects related to the environment. In this work, we present
    the empirical evaluation of an adaptive Spoken Language Understanding chain for
    robotic commands, that explicitly depends on the operational environment during
    both the learning and recognition stages. The effectiveness of such a context-sensitive
    command interpretation is tested against an extension of an already existing corpus
    of commands, that introduced explicit perceptual knowledge: this enabled deeper
    measures proving that more accurate disambiguation capabilities can be actually
    obtained.'

  abstract: "As robots begin to cohabit with humans in semi-structured environments,\
    \ the need arises to understand instructions involving rich variability\u2014\
    for instance, learning to ground symbols in the physical world. Realistically,\
    \ this task must cope with small datasets consisting of a particular users\u2019\
    \ contextual assignment of meaning to terms. We present a method for processing\
    \ a raw stream of cross-modal input\u2014i.e., linguistic instructions, visual\
    \ perception of a scene and a concurrent trace of 3D eye tracking fixations\u2014\
    to produce the segmentation of objects with a correspondent association to high-level\
    \ concepts. To test our framework we present experiments in a table-top object\
    \ manipulation scenario. Our results show our model learns the user\u2019s notion\
    \ of colour and shape from a small number of physical demonstrations, generalising\
    \ to identifying physical referents for novel combinations of the words."

  abstract: "Robot-directed communication is variable, and may change based on human\
    \ perception of robot capabilities. To collect training data for a dialogue system\
    \ and to investigate possible communication changes over time, we developed a\
    \ Wizard-of-Oz study that (a) simulates a robot\u2019s limited understanding,\
    \ and (b) collects dialogues where human participants build a progressively better\
    \ mental model of the robot\u2019s understanding. With ten participants, we collected\
    \ ten hours of human-robot dialogue. We analyzed the structure of instructions\
    \ that participants gave to a remote robot before it responded. Our findings show\
    \ a general initial preference for including metric information (e.g., move forward\
    \ 3 feet) over landmarks (e.g., move to the desk) in motion commands, but this\
    \ decreased over time, suggesting changes in perception."

  abstract: 'Robots operating alongside humans in diverse, stochastic environments
    must be able to accurately interpret natural language commands. These instructions
    often fall into one of two categories: those that specify a goal condition or
    target state, and those that specify explicit actions, or how to perform a given
    task. Recent approaches have used reward functions as a semantic representation
    of goal-based commands, which allows for the use of a state-of-the-art planner
    to find a policy for the given task. However, these reward functions cannot be
    directly used to represent action-oriented commands. We introduce a new hybrid
    approach, the Deep Recurrent Action-Goal Grounding Network (DRAGGN), for task
    grounding and execution that handles natural language from either category as
    input, and generalizes to unseen environments. Our robot-simulation results demonstrate
    that a system successfully interpreting both goal-oriented and action-oriented
    task specifications brings us closer to robust natural language understanding
    for human-robot interaction.'

  abstract: Distributional word representation methods exploit word co-occurrences
    to build compact vector encodings of words. While these representations enjoy
    widespread use in modern natural language processing, it is unclear whether they
    accurately encode all necessary facets of conceptual meaning. In this paper, we
    evaluate how well these representations can predict perceptual and conceptual
    features of concrete concepts, drawing on two semantic norm datasets sourced from
    human participants. We find that several standard word representations fail to
    encode many salient perceptual features of concepts, and show that these deficits
    correlate with word-word similarity prediction errors. Our analyses provide motivation
    for grounded and embodied language learning approaches, which may help to remedy
    these deficits.

  abstract: "Recognition of social signals, coming from human facial expressions or\
    \ prosody of human speech, is a popular research topic in human-robot interaction\
    \ studies. There is also a long line of research in the spoken dialogue community\
    \ that investigates user satisfaction in relation to dialogue characteristics.\
    \ However, very little research relates a combination of multimodal social signals\
    \ and language features detected during spoken face-to-face human-robot interaction\
    \ to the resulting user perception of a robot. In this paper we show how different\
    \ emotional facial expressions of human users, in combination with prosodic characteristics\
    \ of human speech and features of human-robot dialogue, correlate with users\u2019\
    \ impressions of the robot after a conversation. We find that happiness in the\
    \ user\u2019s recognised facial expression strongly correlates with likeability\
    \ of a robot, while dialogue-related features (such as number of human turns or\
    \ number of sentences per robot utterance) correlate with perceiving a robot as\
    \ intelligent. In addition, we show that the facial expression emotional features\
    \ and prosody are better predictors of human ratings related to perceived robot\
    \ likeability and anthropomorphism, while linguistic and non-linguistic features\
    \ more often predict perceived robot intelligence and interpretability. As such,\
    \ these characteristics may in future be used as an online reward signal for in-situ\
    \ Reinforcement Learning-based adaptive human-robot dialogue systems."

  abstract: Agents that communicate back and forth with humans to help them execute
    non-linguistic tasks are a long sought goal of AI. These agents need to translate
    between utterances and actionable meaning representations that can be interpreted
    by task-specific problem solvers in a context-dependent manner. They should also
    be able to learn such actionable interpretations for new predicates on the fly.
    We define an agent architecture for this scenario and present a series of experiments
    in the Blocks World domain that illustrate how our architecture supports language
    learning and problem solving in this domain.

    \ either from the text or the metadata of users\u2019 tweets. We perform our experiments\
    \ on the TwiSty dataset containing manual gender annotations for users speaking\

    \ model based on language-independent features performs worse than the bag-of-words\
    \ model when training and testing on the same language, it regularly outperforms\
    \ the bag-of-words model when applied to different languages, showing very stable\
    \ results across various languages. Finally we perform a comparative analysis\
    \ of feature effect sizes across the six languages and show that differences in\
    \ our features correspond to cultural distances."

  abstract: "Sexism is prevalent in today\u2019s society, both offline and online,\
    \ and poses a credible threat to social equality with respect to gender. According\
    \ to ambivalent sexism theory (Glick and Fiske, 1996), it comes in two forms:\
    \ Hostile and Benevolent. While hostile sexism is characterized by an explicitly\
    \ negative attitude, benevolent sexism is more subtle. Previous works on computationally\
    \ detecting sexism present online are restricted to identifying the hostile form.\
    \ Our objective is to investigate the less pronounced form of sexism demonstrated\
    \ online. We achieve this by creating and analyzing a dataset of tweets that exhibit\
    \ benevolent sexism. By using Support Vector Machines (SVM), sequence-to-sequence\
    \ models and FastText classifier, we classify tweets into \u2018Hostile\u2019\
    , \u2018Benevolent\u2019 or \u2018Others\u2019 class depending on the kind of\
    \ sexism they exhibit. We have been able to achieve an F1-score of 87.22% using\
    \ FastText classifier. Our work helps analyze and understand the much prevalent\
    \ ambivalent sexism in social media."

  abstract: Personality plays a decisive role in how people behave in different scenarios,
    including online social media. Researchers have used such data to study how personality
    can be predicted from language use. In this paper, we study phrase choice as a
    particular stylistic linguistic difference, as opposed to the mostly topical differences
    identified previously. Building on previous work on demographic preferences, we
    quantify differences in paraphrase choice from a massive Facebook data set with
    posts from over 115,000 users. We quantify the predictive power of phrase choice
    in user profiling and use phrase choice to study psycholinguistic hypotheses.
    This work is relevant to future applications that aim to personalize text generation
    to specific personality types.

  abstract: Vector embeddings of words have been shown to encode meaningful semantic
    relationships that enable solving of complex analogies. This vector embedding
    concept has been extended successfully to many different domains and in this paper
    we both create and visualize vector representations of an unstructured collection
    of online communities based on user participation. Further, we quantitatively
    and qualitatively show that these representations allow solving of semantically
    meaningful community analogies and also other more general types of relationships.
    These results could help improve community recommendation engines and also serve
    as a tool for sociological studies of community relatedness.

  abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the predictability of tweets associated with
    controversial versus non-controversial topics. As a first step, we crowd-sourced
    the scoring of a predefined set of topics on a Likert scale from non-controversial
    to controversial. Our feature set entails and goes beyond sentiment features,
    e.g., by leveraging empathic language and other features that have been previously
    used but are new for this particular study. We find focusing on the structural
    characteristics of tweets to be beneficial for this task. Using a combination
    of emphatic, language-specific, and Twitter-specific features for supervised learning
    resulted in 87% accuracy (F1) for cross-validation of the training set and 63.4%
    accuracy when using the test set. Our analysis shows that features specific to
    Twitter or social media, in general, are more prevalent in tweets on controversial
    topics than in non-controversial ones. To test the premise of the paper, we conducted
    two additional sets of experiments, which led to mixed results. This finding will
    inform our future investigations into the relationship between language use on
    social media and the perceived controversiality of topics.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for cross-lingual topical coding
    of sentences from electoral manifestos of political parties in different languages.
    To this end, we exploit continuous semantic text representations and induce a
    joint multilingual semantic vector spaces to enable supervised learning using
    manually-coded sentences across different languages. Our experimental results
    show that classifiers trained on multilingual data yield performance boosts over
    monolingual topic classification.

  abstract: Research in Social Science is usually based on survey data where individual
    research questions relate to observable concepts (variables). However, due to
    a lack of standards for data citations a reliable identification of the variables
    used is often difficult. In this paper, we present a work-in-progress study that
    seeks to provide a solution to the variable detection task based on supervised
    machine learning algorithms, using a linguistic analysis pipeline to extract a
    rich feature set, including terminological concepts and similarity metric scores.
    Further, we present preliminary results on a small dataset that has been specifically
    designed for this task, yielding a significant increase in performance over the
    random baseline.

  abstract: We explore a novel computational approach for analyzing member participation
    in small group social sequences. Using a complex state representation combining
    information about dialogue act types, sentiment expression, and participant roles,
    we explore which sequence states are associated with high levels of member participation.
    Using a Markov Rewards framework, we associate particular states with immediate
    positive and negative rewards, and employ a Value Iteration algorithm to calculate
    the expected value of all states. In our findings, we focus on discourse states
    belonging to team leaders and project managers which are either very likely or
    very unlikely to lead to participation from the rest of the group members.

  abstract: Code-switching has been found to have social motivations in addition to
    syntactic constraints. In this work, we explore the social effect of code-switching
    in an online community. We present a task from the Arabic Wikipedia to capture
    language choice, in this case code-switching between Arabic and other languages,
    as a predictor of social influence in collaborative editing. We find that code-switching
    is positively associated with Wikipedia editor success, particularly borrowing
    technical language on pages with topics less directly related to Arabic-speaking
    regions.

  abstract: Politicians carefully word their statements in order to influence how
    others view an issue, a political strategy called framing. Simultaneously, these
    frames may also reveal the beliefs or positions on an issue of the politician.
    Simple language features such as unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams are important
    indicators for identifying the general frame of a text, for both longer congressional
    speeches and shorter tweets of politicians. However, tweets may contain multiple
    unigrams across different frames which limits the effectiveness of this approach.
    In this paper, we present a joint model which uses both linguistic features of
    tweets and ideological phrase indicators extracted from a state-of-the-art embedding-based
    model to predict the general frame of political tweets.

  abstract: In this paper, we use a new categorical form of multidimensional register
    analysis to identify the main dimensions of functional linguistic variation in
    a corpus of abusive language, consisting of racist and sexist Tweets. By analysing
    the use of a wide variety of parts-of-speech and grammatical constructions, as
    well as various features related to Twitter and computer-mediated communication,
    we discover three dimensions of linguistic variation in this corpus, which we
    interpret as being related to the degree of interactive, antagonistic and attitudinal
    language exhibited by individual Tweets. We then demonstrate that there is a significant
    functional difference between racist and sexist Tweets, with sexists Tweets tending
    to be more interactive and attitudinal than racist Tweets.

  abstract: We discuss the characteristics of constructive news comments, and present
    methods to identify them. First, we define the notion of constructiveness. Second,
    we annotate a corpus for constructiveness. Third, we explore whether available
    argumentation corpora can be useful to identify constructiveness in news comments.
    Our model trained on argumentation corpora achieves a top accuracy of 72.59% (baseline=49.44%)
    on our crowd-annotated test data. Finally, we examine the relation between constructiveness
    and toxicity. In our crowd-annotated data, 21.42% of the non-constructive comments
    and 17.89% of the constructive comments are toxic, suggesting that non-constructive
    comments are not much more toxic than constructive comments.

  abstract: This paper proposes a system that can detect and rephrase profanity in
    Chinese text. Rather than just masking detected profanity, we want to revise the
    input sentence by using inoffensive words while keeping their original meanings.
    29 of such rephrasing rules were invented after observing sentences on real-word
    social websites. The overall accuracy of the proposed system is 85.56%

  abstract: Experimenting with a new dataset of 1.6M user comments from a Greek news
    portal and existing datasets of EnglishWikipedia comments, we show that an RNN
    outperforms the previous state of the art in moderation. A deep, classification-specific
    attention mechanism improves further the overall performance of the RNN. We also
    compare against a CNN and a word-list baseline, considering both fully automatic
    and semi-automatic moderation.

  abstract: "Common approaches to text categorization essentially rely either on n-gram\
    \ counts or on word embeddings. This presents important difficulties in highly\
    \ dynamic or quickly-interacting environments, where the appearance of new words\
    \ and/or varied misspellings is the norm. A paradigmatic example of this situation\
    \ is abusive online behavior, with social networks and media platforms struggling\
    \ to effectively combat uncommon or non-blacklisted hate words. To better deal\
    \ with these issues in those fast-paced environments, we propose using the error\
    \ signal of class-based language models as input to text classification algorithms.\
    \ In particular, we train a next-character prediction model for any given class\
    \ and then exploit the error of such class-based models to inform a neural network\
    \ classifier. This way, we shift from the \u2018ability to describe\u2019 seen\
    \ documents to the \u2018ability to predict\u2019 unseen content. Preliminary\
    \ studies using out-of-vocabulary splits from abusive tweet data show promising\
    \ results, outperforming competitive text categorization strategies by 4-11%."

  abstract: Automatic abusive language detection is a difficult but important task
    for online social media. Our research explores a two-step approach of performing
    classification on abusive language and then classifying into specific types and
    compares it with one-step approach of doing one multi-class classification for
    detecting sexist and racist languages. With a public English Twitter corpus of
    20 thousand tweets in the type of sexism and racism, our approach shows a promising
    performance of 0.827 F-measure by using HybridCNN in one-step and 0.824 F-measure
    by using logistic regression in two-steps.

  abstract: Although social media has made it easy for people to connect on a virtually
    unlimited basis, it has also opened doors to people who misuse it to undermine,
    harass, humiliate, threaten and bully others. There is a lack of adequate resources
    to detect and hinder its occurrence. In this paper, we present our initial NLP
    approach to detect invective posts as a first step to eventually detect and deter
    cyberbullying. We crawl data containing profanities and then determine whether
    or not it contains invective. Annotations on this data are improved iteratively
    by in-lab annotations and crowdsourcing. We pursue different NLP approaches containing
    various typical and some newer techniques to distinguish the use of swear words
    in a neutral way from those instances in which they are used in an insulting way.
    We also show that this model not only works for our data set, but also can be
    successfully applied to different data sets.

  abstract: This work is part of a new initiative to use machine learning to identify
    online harassment in social media and comment streams. Online harassment goes
    under-reported due to the reliance on humans to identify and report harassment,
    reporting that is further slowed by requirements to fill out forms providing context.
    In addition, the time for moderators to respond and apply human judgment can take
    days, but response times in terms of minutes are needed in the online context.
    Though some of the major social media companies have been doing proprietary work
    in automating the detection of harassment, there are few tools available for use
    by the public. In addition, the amount of labeled online harassment data and availability
    of cross-platform online harassment datasets is limited. We present the methodology
    used to create a harassment dataset and classifier and the dataset used to help
    the system learn what harassment looks like.

  abstract: As the body of research on abusive language detection and analysis grows,
    there is a need for critical consideration of the relationships between different
    subtasks that have been grouped under this label. Based on work on hate speech,
    cyberbullying, and online abuse we propose a typology that captures central similarities
    and differences between subtasks and discuss the implications of this for data
    annotation and feature construction. We emphasize the practical actions that can
    be taken by researchers to best approach their abusive language detection subtask
    of interest.

  abstract: 'The paper introduces a deep learning-based Twitter hate-speech text classification
    system. The classifier assigns each tweet to one of four predefined categories:
    racism, sexism, both (racism and sexism) and non-hate-speech. Four Convolutional
    Neural Network models were trained on resp. character 4-grams, word vectors based
    on semantic information built using word2vec, randomly generated word vectors,
    and word vectors combined with character n-grams. The feature set was down-sized
    in the networks by max-pooling, and a softmax function used to classify tweets.
    Tested by 10-fold cross-validation, the model based on word2vec embeddings performed
    best, with higher precision than recall, and a 78.3% F-score.'

  abstract: "This paper focuses on a particular type of abusive language, targeting\
    \ expressions in which typically neutral adjectives take on pejorative meaning\
    \ when used as nouns - compare \u2018gay people\u2019 to \u2018the gays\u2019\
    . We first collect and analyze a corpus of hand-curated, expert-annotated pejorative\
    \ nominalizations for four target adjectives: female, gay, illegal, and poor.\
    \ We then collect a second corpus of automatically-extracted and POS-tagged, crowd-annotated\
    \ tweets. For both corpora, we find support for the hypothesis that some adjectives,\
    \ when nominalized, take on negative meaning. The targeted constructions are non-standard\
    \ yet widely-used, and part-of-speech taggers mistag some nominal forms as adjectives.\
    \ We implement a tool called NomCatcher to correct these mistaggings, and find\
    \ that the same tool is effective for identifying new adjectives subject to transformation\
    \ via nominalization into abusive language."

  abstract: Automatic detection of depression has attracted increasing attention from
    researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, and related disciplines.
    As a result, promising depression detection systems have been reported. This paper
    surveys these efforts by presenting the first cross-modal review of depression
    detection systems and discusses best practices and most promising approaches to
    this task.

  abstract: In this paper, we provide the first quantified exploration of the structure
    of the language of dreams, their linguistic style and emotional content. We present
    a collection of digital dream logs as a viable corpus for the growing study of
    mental health through the lens of language, complementary to the work done examining
    more traditional social media. This paper is largely exploratory in nature to
    lay the groundwork for subsequent research in mental health, rather than optimizing
    a particular text classification task.

  abstract: Social connection and social isolation are associated with depressive
    symptoms, particularly in adolescents and young adults, but how these concepts
    are documented in clinical notes is unknown. This pilot study aimed to identify
    the topics relevant to social connection and isolation by analyzing 145 clinical
    notes from patients with depression diagnosis. We found that providers, including
    physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists, document descriptions of
    both social connection and social isolation.

  abstract: 'We propose an automated system that can identify at-risk users from their
    public social media activity, more specifically, from Twitter. The data that we
    collected is from the #BellLetsTalk campaign, which is a wide-reaching, multi-year
    program designed to break the silence around mental illness and support mental
    health across Canada. To achieve our goal, we trained a user-level classifier
    that can detect at-risk users that achieves a reasonable precision and recall.
    We also trained a tweet-level classifier that predicts if a tweet indicates depression.
    This task was much more difficult due to the imbalanced data. In the dataset that
    we labeled, we came across 5% depression tweets and 95% non-depression tweets.
    To handle this class imbalance, we used undersampling methods. The resulting classifier
    had high recall, but low precision. Therefore, we only use this classifier to
    compute the estimated percentage of depressed tweets and to add this value as
    a feature for the user-level classifier.'

  abstract: In this paper, we use qualitative research methods to investigate the
    attitudes of social media users towards the (opt-in) integration of social media
    data with routine mental health care and diagnosis. Our investigation was based
    on secondary analysis of a series of five focus groups with Twitter users, including
    three groups consisting of participants with a self-reported history of depression,
    and two groups consisting of participants without a self reported history of depression.
    Our results indicate that, overall, research participants were enthusiastic about
    the possibility of using social media (in conjunction with automated Natural Language
    Processing algorithms) for mood tracking under the supervision of a mental health
    practitioner. However, for at least some participants, there was skepticism related
    to how well social media represents the mental health of users, and hence its
    usefulness in the clinical context.

  abstract: "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety-based disorder that\
    \ affects around 2.5% of the population. A common treatment for OCD is exposure\
    \ therapy, where the patient repeatedly confronts a feared experience, which has\
    \ the long-term effect of decreasing their anxiety. Some exposures consist of\
    \ reading and writing stories about an imagined anxiety-provoking scenario. In\
    \ this paper, we present a technology that enables patients to interactively contribute\
    \ to exposure stories by supplying natural language input (typed or spoken) that\
    \ advances a scenario. This interactivity could potentially increase the patient\u2019\
    s sense of immersion in an exposure and contribute to its success. We introduce\
    \ the NLP task behind processing inputs to predict new events in the scenario,\
    \ and describe our initial approach. We then illustrate the future possibility\
    \ of this work with an example of an exposure scenario authored with our application."

  abstract: Previous investigations into detecting mental illnesses through social
    media have predominately focused on detecting depression through Twitter corpora.
    In this paper, we study anxiety disorders through personal narratives collected
    through the popular social media website, Reddit. We build a substantial data
    set of typical and anxiety-related posts, and we apply N-gram language modeling,
    vector embeddings, topic analysis, and emotional norms to generate features that
    accurately classify posts related to binary levels of anxiety. We achieve an accuracy
    of 91% with vector-space word embeddings, and an accuracy of 98% when combined
    with lexicon-based features.

  abstract: Individuals on social media may reveal themselves to be in various states
    of crisis (e.g. suicide, self-harm, abuse, or eating disorders). Detecting crisis
    from social media text automatically and accurately can have profound consequences.
    However, detecting a general state of crisis without explaining why has limited
    applications. An explanation in this context is a coherent, concise subset of
    the text that rationalizes the crisis detection. We explore several methods to
    detect and explain crisis using a combination of neural and non-neural techniques.
    We evaluate these techniques on a unique data set obtained from Koko, an anonymous
    emotional support network available through various messaging applications. We
    annotate a small subset of the samples labeled with crisis with corresponding
    explanations. Our best technique significantly outperforms the baseline for detection
    and explanation.

  abstract: People typically assume that killers are mentally ill or fundamentally
    different from the rest of humanity. Similarly, people often associate mental
    health conditions (such as schizophrenia or autism) with violence and otherness
    - treatable perhaps, but not empathically understandable. We take a dictionary
    approach to explore word use in a set of autobiographies, comparing the narratives
    of 2 killers (Adolf Hitler and Elliot Rodger) and 39 non-killers. Although results
    suggest several dimensions that differentiate these autobiographies - such as
    sentiment, temporal orientation, and references to death - they appear to reflect
    subject matter rather than psychology per se. Additionally, the Rodger text shows
    roughly typical developmental arcs in its use of words relating to friends, family,
    sex, and affect. From these data, we discuss the challenges of understanding killers
    and people in general.

  abstract: Many psychological phenomena occur in small time windows, measured in
    minutes or hours. However, most computational linguistic techniques look at data
    on the order of weeks, months, or years. We explore micropatterns in sequences
    of messages occurring over a short time window for their prevalence and power
    for quantifying psychological phenomena, specifically, patterns in affect. We
    examine affective micropatterns in social media posts from users with anxiety,
    eating disorders, panic attacks, schizophrenia, suicidality, and matched controls.

  abstract: "Recently, the attention mechanism plays a key role to achieve high performance\
    \ for Neural Machine Translation models. However, as it computes a score function\
    \ for the encoder states in all positions at each decoding step, the attention\
    \ model greatly increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate\
    \ the adequate vision span of attention models in the context of machine translation,\
    \ by proposing a novel attention framework that is capable of reducing redundant\
    \ score computation dynamically. The term \u201Cvision span\u201D\u2019 means\
    \ a window of the encoder states considered by the attention model in one step.\
    \ In our experiments, we found that the average window size of vision span can\
    \ be reduced by over 50% with modest loss in accuracy on English-Japanese and\
    \ German-English translation tasks."

  abstract: In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis about the modeling and search
    performance. We address the question if a more complex search algorithm is necessary.
    Furthermore, we investigate the question if more complex models which might only
    be applicable during rescoring are promising. By separating the search space and
    the modeling using n-best list reranking, we analyze the influence of both parts
    of an NMT system independently. By comparing differently performing NMT systems,
    we show that the better translation is already in the search space of the translation
    systems with less performance. This results indicate that the current search algorithms
    are sufficient for the NMT systems. Furthermore, we could show that even a relatively
    small n-best list of 50 hypotheses already contain notably better translations.

  abstract: "Interest in neural machine translation has grown rapidly as its effectiveness\
    \ has been demonstrated across language and data scenarios. New research regularly\
    \ introduces architectural and algorithmic improvements that lead to significant\
    \ gains over \u201Cvanilla\u201D NMT implementations. However, these new techniques\
    \ are rarely evaluated in the context of previously published techniques, specifically\
    \ those that are widely used in state-of-the-art production and shared-task systems.\
    \ As a result, it is often difficult to determine whether improvements from research\
    \ will carry over to systems deployed for real-world use. In this work, we recommend\
    \ three specific methods that are relatively easy to implement and result in much\
    \ stronger experimental systems. Beyond reporting significantly higher BLEU scores,\
    \ we conduct an in-depth analysis of where improvements originate and what inherent\
    \ weaknesses of basic NMT models are being addressed. We then compare the relative\
    \ gains afforded by several other techniques proposed in the literature when starting\
    \ with vanilla systems versus our stronger baselines, showing that experimental\
    \ conclusions may change depending on the baseline chosen. This indicates that\
    \ choosing a strong baseline is crucial for reporting reliable experimental results."

  abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation technique for neural
    machine translation called cost weighting, which is appropriate for adaptation
    scenarios in which a small in-domain data set and a large general-domain data
    set are available. Cost weighting incorporates a domain classifier into the neural
    machine translation training algorithm, using features derived from the encoder
    representation in order to distinguish in-domain from out-of-domain data. Classifier
    probabilities are used to weight sentences according to their domain similarity
    when updating the parameters of the neural translation model. We compare cost
    weighting to two traditional domain adaptation techniques developed for statistical
    machine translation: data selection and sub-corpus weighting. Experiments on two
    large-data tasks show that both the traditional techniques and our novel proposal
    lead to significant gains, with cost weighting outperforming the traditional methods.'

  abstract: 'Despite its promise, neural machine translation (NMT) has a serious problem
    in that source content may be mistakenly left untranslated. The ability to detect
    untranslated content is important for the practical use of NMT. We evaluate two
    types of probability with which to detect untranslated content: the cumulative
    attention (ATN) probability and back translation (BT) probability from the target
    sentence to the source sentence. Experiments on detecting untranslated content
    in Japanese-English patent translations show that ATN and BT are each more effective
    than random choice, BT is more effective than ATN, and the combination of the
    two provides further improvements. We also confirmed the effectiveness of using
    ATN and BT to rerank the n-best NMT outputs.'

  abstract: The basic concept in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is to train a large
    Neural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a given parallel
    corpus. NMT is then using a simple left-to-right beam-search decoder to generate
    new translations that approximately maximize the trained conditional probability.
    The current beam search strategy generates the target sentence word by word from
    left-to-right while keeping a fixed amount of active candidates at each time step.
    First, this simple search is less adaptive as it also expands candidates whose
    scores are much worse than the current best. Secondly, it does not expand hypotheses
    if they are not within the best scoring candidates, even if their scores are close
    to the best one. The latter one can be avoided by increasing the beam size until
    no performance improvement can be observed. While you can reach better performance,
    this has the drawback of a slower decoding speed. In this paper, we concentrate
    on speeding up the decoder by applying a more flexible beam search strategy whose
    candidate size may vary at each time step depending on the candidate scores. We
    speed up the original decoder by up to 43% for the two language pairs German to
    English and Chinese to English without losing any translation quality.

  abstract: Training of neural machine translation (NMT) models usually uses mini-batches
    for efficiency purposes. During the mini-batched training process, it is necessary
    to pad shorter sentences in a mini-batch to be equal in length to the longest
    sentence therein for efficient computation. Previous work has noted that sorting
    the corpus based on the sentence length before making mini-batches reduces the
    amount of padding and increases the processing speed. However, despite the fact
    that mini-batch creation is an essential step in NMT training, widely used NMT
    toolkits implement disparate strategies for doing so, which have not been empirically
    validated or compared. This work investigates mini-batch creation strategies with
    experiments over two different datasets. Our results suggest that the choice of
    a mini-batch creation strategy has a large effect on NMT training and some length-based
    sorting strategies do not always work well compared with simple shuffling.

  abstract: In this paper, we study AMR-to-text generation, framing it as a translation
    task and comparing two different MT approaches (Phrase-based and Neural MT). We
    systematically study the effects of 3 AMR preprocessing steps (Delexicalisation,
    Compression, and Linearisation) applied before the MT phase. Our results show
    that preprocessing indeed helps, although the benefits differ for the two MT models.

  abstract: "Poetry generation is becoming popular among researchers of Natural Language\
    \ Generation, Computational Creativity and, broadly, Artificial Intelligence.\
    \ To produce text that may be regarded as poetry, poetry generation systems are\
    \ typically knowledge-intensive and have to deal with several levels of language,\
    \ from lexical to semantics. Interest on the topic resulted in the development\
    \ of several poetry generators described in the literature, with different features\
    \ covered or handled differently, by a broad range of alternative approaches,\
    \ as well as different perspectives on evaluation, another challenging aspect\
    \ due the underlying subjectivity. This paper surveys intelligent poetry generators\
    \ around a set of relevant axis for poetry generation \u2013 targeted languages,\
    \ form and content features, techniques, reutilisation of material, and evaluation\
    \ \u2013 and aims to organise work developed on this topic so far."

  abstract: Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated
    on large image description datasets. Recently, researchers have started to collect
    such datasets for languages other than English. An unexplored question is how
    different these datasets are from English and, if there are any differences, what
    causes them to differ. This paper provides a cross-linguistic comparison of Dutch,
    English, and German image descriptions. We find that these descriptions are similar
    in many respects, but the familiarity of crowd workers with the subjects of the
    images has a noticeable influence on the specificity of the descriptions.

  abstract: We study the task of constructing sports news report automatically from
    live commentary and focus on content selection. Rather than receiving every piece
    of text of a sports match before news construction, as in previous related work,
    we novelly verify the feasibility of a more challenging but more useful setting
    to generate news report on the fly by treating live text input as a stream. Specifically,
    we design various scoring functions to address different requirements of the task.
    The near submodularity of scoring functions makes it possible to adapt efficient
    greedy algorithms even in stream data settings. Experiments suggest that our proposed
    framework can already produce comparable results compared with previous work that
    relies on a supervised learning-to-rank model with heavy feature engineering.

  abstract: 'We present a flexible Natural Language Generation approach for Spanish,
    focused on the surface realisation stage, which integrates an inflection module
    in order to improve the naturalness and expressivity of the generated language.
    This inflection module inflects the verbs using an ensemble of trainable algorithms
    whereas the other types of words (e.g. nouns, determiners, etc) are inflected
    using hand-crafted rules. We show that our approach achieves 2% higher accuracy
    than two state-of-art inflection generation approaches. Furthermore, our proposed
    approach also predicts an extra feature: the inflection of the imperative mood,
    which was not taken into account by previous work. We also present a user evaluation,
    where we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the perceived
    naturalness of the generated language.'

  abstract: "Image captioning has evolved into a core task for Natural Language Generation\
    \ and has also proved to be an important testbed for deep learning approaches\
    \ to handling multimodal representations. Most contemporary approaches rely on\
    \ a combination of a convolutional network to handle image features, and a recurrent\
    \ network to encode linguistic information. The latter is typically viewed as\
    \ the primary \u201Cgeneration\u201D component. Beyond this high-level characterisation,\
    \ a CNN+RNN model supports a variety of architectural designs. The dominant model\
    \ in the literature is one in which visual features encoded by a CNN are \u201C\
    injected\u201D as part of the linguistic encoding process, driving the RNN\u2019\
    s linguistic choices. By contrast, it is possible to envisage an architecture\
    \ in which visual and linguistic features are encoded separately, and merged at\
    \ a subsequent stage. In this paper, we address two related questions: (1) Is\
    \ direct injection the best way of combining multimodal information, or is a late\
    \ merging alternative better for the image captioning task? (2) To what extent\
    \ should a recurrent network be viewed as actually generating, rather than simply\
    \ encoding, linguistic information?"

  abstract: Describing people and characters can be very useful in different contexts,
    such as computational narrative or image description for the visually impaired.
    However, a review of the existing literature shows that the automatic generation
    of people descriptions has not received much attention. Our work focuses on the
    description of people in snapshots from a 3D environment. First, we have conducted
    a survey to identify the way in which people describe other people under different
    conditions. We have used the information extracted from this survey to design
    several Referring Expression Generation algorithms which produce similar results.
    We have evaluated these algorithms with users in order to identify which ones
    generate the best description for specific characters in different situations.
    The evaluation has shown that, in order to generate good descriptions, a combination
    of different algorithms has to be used depending on the features and situation
    of the person to be described.

  abstract: Co-PoeTryMe is a web application for poetry composition, guided by the
    user, though with the help of automatic features, such as the generation of full
    (editable) drafts, as well as the acquisition of additional well-formed lines,
    or semantically-related words, possibly constrained by the number of syllables,
    rhyme, or polarity. Towards the final poem, the latter can replace lines or words
    in the draft.

  abstract: Current referring expression generation systems mostly deliver their output
    as one-shot, written expressions. We present on-going work on incremental generation
    of spoken expressions referring to objects in real-world images. This approach
    extends upon previous work using the words-as-classifier model for generation.
    We implement this generator in an incremental dialogue processing framework such
    that we can exploit an existing interface to incremental text-to-speech synthesis.
    Our system generates and synthesizes referring expressions while continuously
    observing non-verbal user reactions.

  abstract: For situated agents to effectively engage in natural-language interactions
    with humans, they must be able to refer to entities such as people, locations,
    and objects. While classic referring expression generation (REG) algorithms like
    the Incremental Algorithm (IA) assume perfect, complete, and accessible knowledge
    of all referents, this is not always possible. In this work, we show how a previously
    presented consultant framework (which facilitates reference resolution when knowledge
    is uncertain, heterogeneous and distributed) can be used to extend the IA to produce
    DIST-PIA, a domain-independent algorithm for REG under uncertain, heterogeneous,
    and distributed knowledge. We also present a novel framework that can be used
    to evaluate such REG algorithms without conflating the performance of the algorithm
    with the performance of classifiers it employs.

  abstract: There has been continuous growth in the volume and ubiquity of video material.
    It has become essential to define video semantics in order to aid the searchability
    and retrieval of this data. We present a framework that produces textual descriptions
    of video, based on the visual semantic content. Detected action classes rendered
    as verbs, participant objects converted to noun phrases, visual properties of
    detected objects rendered as adjectives and spatial relations between objects
    rendered as prepositions. Further, in cases of zero-shot action recognition, a
    language model is used to infer a missing verb, aided by the detection of objects
    and scene settings. These extracted features are converted into textual descriptions
    using a template-based approach. The proposed video descriptions framework evaluated
    on the NLDHA dataset using ROUGE scores and human judgment evaluation.

  abstract: We present PASS, a data-to-text system that generates Dutch soccer reports
    from match statistics. One of the novel elements of PASS is the fact that the
    system produces corpus-based texts tailored towards fans of one club or the other,
    which can most prominently be observed in the tone of voice used in the reports.
    Furthermore, the system is open source and uses a modular design, which makes
    it relatively easy for people to add extensions. Human-based evaluation shows
    that people are generally positive towards PASS in regards to its clarity and
    fluency, and that the tailoring is accurately recognized in most cases.

  abstract: "We use language to talk about the world, and so reference is a crucial\
    \ property of language. However, modeling reference is particularly difficult,\
    \ as it involves both continuous and discrete as-pects of language. For instance,\
    \ referring expressions like \u201Cthe big mug\u201D or \u201Cit\u201D typically\
    \ contain content words (\u201Cbig\u201D, \u201Cmug\u201D), which are notoriously\
    \ fuzzy or vague in their meaning, and also fun-ction words (\u201Cthe\u201D,\
    \ \u201Cit\u201D) that largely serve as discrete pointers. Data-driven, distributed\
    \ models based on distributional semantics or deep learning excel at the former,\
    \ but struggle with the latter, and the reverse is true for symbolic models. I\
    \ present ongoing work on modeling reference with a distribu-ted model aimed at\
    \ capturing both aspects, and learns to refer directly from reference acts."

    function descriptions from example software projects. Data is drawn from existing
    resources used for studying the related problem of semantic parser induction,
    and spans a wide variety of both natural languages and programming languages.
    In this paper, we describe these existing resources, which will serve as training
    and development data for the task, and discuss plans for building new independent
    test sets.

  abstract: We propose a shared task on multilingual Surface Realization, i.e., on
    mapping unordered and uninflected universal dependency trees to correctly ordered
    and inflected sentences in a number of languages. A second deeper input will be
    available in which, in addition, functional words, fine-grained PoS and morphological
    information will be removed from the input trees. The first shared task on Surface
    Realization was carried out in 2011 with a similar setup, with a focus on English.
    We think that it is time for relaunching such a shared task effort in view of
    the arrival of Universal Dependencies annotated treebanks for a large number of
    languages on the one hand, and the increasing dominance of Deep Learning, which
    proved to be a game changer for NLP, on the other hand.

    important (at least to XXX) and the NLG research literature. In particular, XXX
    is less interested in generic reference algorithms than in high-quality algorithms
    for specific types of references, such as components of machines, named entities,

  abstract: Integrating surface realization and the generation of referring expressions
    into a single algorithm can improve the quality of the generated sentences. Existing
    algorithms for doing this, such as SPUD and CRISP, are search-based and can be
    slow or incomplete. We offer a chart-based algorithm for integrated sentence generation

    for the Spanish language. Our implementation is based on the bilingual English-French
    SimpleNLG-EnFr adaptation. The library has been tested using a battery of examples
    that ensure that the most common syntax, morphology and orthography rules for
    Spanish are met. The library is currently being used in three different projects
    for the development of data-to-text systems in the meteorological, statistical
    data information, and business intelligence application domains.

  abstract: Corpora of referring expressions elicited from human participants in a
    controlled environment are an important resource for research on automatic referring
    expression generation. We here present G-TUNA, a new corpus of referring expressions
    for German. Using the furniture stimuli set developed for the TUNA and D-TUNA
    corpora, our corpus extends on these corpora by providing data collected in a
    simulated driving dual-task setting, and additionally provides exact duration
    annotations for the spoken referring expressions. This corpus will hence allow
    researchers to analyze the interaction between referring expression length and
    speech rate, under conditions where the listener is under high vs. low cognitive
    load.

  abstract: There are many domain-specific and language-specific NLG systems, of which
    it may be possible to adapt to related domains and languages. The languages in
    the Bantu language family have their own set of features distinct from other major
    groups, which therefore severely limits the options to bootstrap an NLG system
    from existing ones. We present here our first proof-of-concept application for
    knowledge-to-text NLG as a plugin to the Protege 5.x ontology development system,
    tailored to Runyankore, a Bantu language indigenous to Uganda. It comprises a
    basic annotation model for linguistic information such as noun class, an implementation
    of existing verbalisation rules and a CFG for verbs, and a basic interface for
    data entry.

  abstract: We present two approaches to generate titles for browse pages in five
    different languages, namely English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. These
    browse pages are structured search pages in an e-commerce domain. We first present
    a rule-based approach to generate these browse page titles. In addition, we also
    present a hybrid approach which uses a phrase-based statistical machine translation
    engine on top of the rule-based system to assemble the best title. For the two
    languages English and German we have access to a large amount of already available
    rule-based generated and curated titles. For these languages we present an automatic
    post-editing approach which learns how to post-edit the rule-based titles into
    curated titles.

    \ basis at the content determination stage of narrative generation. The model\
    \ lends itself as the theoretical foundation for a suspense module that is compatible\

  abstract: Despite increasing amounts of data and ever improving natural language
    generation techniques, work on automated journalism is still relatively scarce.
    In this paper, we explore the field and challenges associated with building a
    journalistic natural language generation system. We present a set of requirements
    that should guide system design, including transparency, accuracy, modifiability
    and transferability. Guided by the requirements, we present a data-driven architecture
    for automated journalism that is largely domain and language independent. We illustrate
    its practical application in the production of news articles about the 2017 Finnish
    municipal elections in three languages, demonstrating the successfulness of the
    data-driven, modular approach of the design. We then draw some lessons for future
    automated journalism.

  abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep neural networks for image
    classification tasks. Simply flipping images can help learning tremendously by
    increasing the number of training images by a factor of two. However, little work
    has been done studying data augmentation in natural language processing. Here,
    we describe two methods for data augmentation for Visual Question Answering (VQA).
    The first uses existing semantic annotations to generate new questions. The second
    method is a generative approach using recurrent neural networks. Experiments show
    that the proposed data augmentation improves performance of both baseline and
    state-of-the-art VQA algorithms.

  abstract: This work proposes an organization of knowledge to facilitate the generation
    of personalized questions, answers and grammars from web documents. To reduce
    the human effort needed in the generation of the linguistic resources for a new
    domain, the general aspects that can be reuse across domains are separated from
    those more specific. The proposed approach is based on the representation of the
    main domain concepts as a set of attributes. These attributes are related to a
    syntactico-semantic taxonomy representing the general relationships between conceptual
    and linguistic knowledge. User models are incorporated by distinguishing different
    user groups and relating each group to the appropriate conceptual attributes.
    Then, the data is extracted from the web documents and represented as instances
    of the domain concepts. Questions, answers and grammars are generated from these
    instances.

  abstract: We compare several language models for the word-ordering task and propose
    a new bag-to-sequence neural model based on attention-based sequence-to-sequence
    models. We evaluate the model on a large German WMT data set where it significantly
    outperforms existing models. We also describe a novel search strategy for LM-based
    word ordering and report results on the English Penn Treebank. Our best model
    setup outperforms prior work both in terms of speed and quality.

  abstract: East Asian languages are thought to handle reference differently from
    languages such as English, particularly in terms of the marking of definiteness
    and number. We present the first Data-Text corpus for Referring Expressions in
    Mandarin, and we use this corpus to test some initial hypotheses inspired by the
    theoretical linguistics literature. Our findings suggest that function words deserve
    more attention in Referring Expressions Generation than they have so far received,
    and they have a bearing on the debate about whether different languages make different
    trade-offs between clarity and brevity.

  abstract: We propose sentence chunking as a way to reduce the time and memory costs
    of realization of long sentences. During chunking we divide the semantic representation
    of a sentence into smaller components which can be processed and recombined without
    loss of information. Our meaning representation of choice is the Dependency Minimal
    Recursion Semantics (DMRS). We show that realizing chunks of a sentence and combining
    the results of such realizations increases the coverage for long sentences, significantly
    reduces the resources required and does not affect the quality of the realization.

  abstract: A generation system can only be as good as the data it is trained on.
    In this short paper, we propose a methodology for analysing data-to-text corpora
    used for training Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. We apply this methodology
    to three existing benchmarks. We conclude by eliciting a set of criteria for the
    creation of a data-to-text benchmark which could help better support the development,
    evaluation and comparison of linguistically sophisticated data-to-text generators.

  abstract: Monitoring and analysis of complex phenomena attract the attention of
    both academy and industry. Dealing with data produced by complex phenomena requires
    the use of advance computational intelligence techniques. Namely, linguistic description
    of complex phenomena constitutes a mature research line. It is supported by the
    Computational Theory of Perceptions grounded on the Fuzzy Sets Theory. Its aim
    is the development of computational systems with the ability to generate vague
    descriptions of the world in a similar way how humans do. This is a human-centric
    and multi-disciplinary research work. Moreover, its success is a matter of careful
    design; thus, developers play a key role. The rLDCP R package was designed to
    facilitate the development of new applications. This demo introduces the use of
    rLDCP, for both beginners and advance developers, in practical use cases.

    adapt the neural machine translation approach to paraphrase generation and perform
    transfer learning from the closely related task of entailment generation. We evaluate
    the model on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase (MSRP) corpus and show that the
    model is able to generate sentences that capture part of the original meaning,
    but fails to pick up on important words or to show large lexical variation.

  abstract: Most of neural language models use different kinds of embeddings for word
    prediction. While word embeddings can be associated to each word in the vocabulary
    or derived from characters as well as factored morphological decomposition, these
    word representations are mainly used to parametrize the input, i.e. the context
    of prediction. This work investigates the effect of using subword units (character
    and factored morphological decomposition) to build output representations for
    neural language modeling. We present a case study on Czech, a morphologically-rich
    language, experimenting with different input and output representations. When
    working with the full training vocabulary, despite unstable training, our experiments
    show that augmenting the output word representations with character-based embeddings
    can significantly improve the performance of the model. Moreover, reducing the
    size of the output look-up table, to let the character-based embeddings represent
    rare words, brings further improvement.

  abstract: We explore the use of segments learnt using Byte Pair Encoding (referred
    to as BPE units) as basic units for statistical machine translation between related
    languages and compare it with orthographic syllables, which are currently the
    best performing basic units for this translation task. BPE identifies the most
    frequent character sequences as basic units, while orthographic syllables are
    linguistically motivated pseudo-syllables. We show that BPE units modestly outperform
    orthographic syllables as units of translation, showing up to 11% increase in
    BLEU score. While orthographic syllables can be used only for languages whose
    writing systems use vowel representations, BPE is writing system independent and
    we show that BPE outperforms other units for non-vowel writing systems too. Our
    results are supported by extensive experimentation spanning multiple language
    families and writing systems.

  abstract: Detecting neologisms is essential in real-time natural language processing
    applications. Not only can it enable to follow the lexical evolution of languages,
    but it is also essential for updating linguistic resources and parsers. In this
    paper, neology detection is considered as a classification task where a system
    has to assess whether a given lexical item is an actual neologism or not. We propose
    a combination of an unsupervised data mining technique and a supervised machine
    learning approach. It is inspired by current researches in stylometry and on token-level
    and character-level patterns. We train and evaluate our system on a manually designed
    reference dataset in French and Russian. We show that this approach is able to
    largely outperform state-of-the-art neology detection systems. Furthermore, character-level
    patterns exhibit good properties for multilingual extensions of the system.

  abstract: In this study we address the problem of automated word stress detection
    in Russian using character level models and no part-speech-taggers. We use a simple
    bidirectional RNN with LSTM nodes and achieve accuracy of 90% or higher. We experiment
    with two training datasets and show that using the data from an annotated corpus
    is much more efficient than using only a dictionary, since it allows to retain
    the context of the word and its morphological features.

  abstract: Word embedding has become a fundamental component to many NLP tasks such
    as named entity recognition and machine translation. However, popular models that
    learn such embeddings are unaware of the morphology of words, so it is not directly
    applicable to highly agglutinative languages such as Korean. We propose a syllable-based
    learning model for Korean using a convolutional neural network, in which word
    representation is composed of trained syllable vectors. Our model successfully
    produces morphologically meaningful representation of Korean words compared to
    the original Skip-gram embeddings. The results also show that it is quite robust
    to the Out-of-Vocabulary problem.

  abstract: Recently, there has been increased interest in utilizing characters or
    subwords for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the effect of utilizing
    character, subword, and word-level information simultaneously has not been examined
    so far. In this paper, we propose a model to leverage various levels of input
    features to improve on the performance of an supersense tagging task. Detailed
    analysis of experimental results show that different levels of input representation
    offer distinct characteristics that explain performance discrepancy among different
    tasks.

  abstract: "Most NLP resources that offer annotations at the word segment level provide\
    \ morphological annotation that includes features indicating tense, aspect, modality,\
    \ gender, case, and other inflectional information. Such information is rarely\
    \ aligned to the relevant parts of the words\u2014i.e. the allomorphs, as such\
    \ annotation would be very costly. These unaligned weak labelings are commonly\
    \ provided by annotated NLP corpora such as treebanks in various languages. Although\
    \ they lack alignment information, the presence/absence of labels at the word\
    \ level is also consistent with the amount of supervision assumed to be provided\
    \ to L1 and L2 learners. In this paper, we explore several methods to learn this\
    \ latent alignment between parts of word forms and the grammatical information\
    \ provided. All the methods under investigation favor hypotheses regarding allomorphs\
    \ of morphemes that re-use a small inventory, i.e. implicitly minimize the number\
    \ of allomorphs that a morpheme can be realized as. We show that the provided\
    \ information offers a significant advantage for both word segmentation and the\
    \ learning of allomorphy."

  abstract: We present a model for predicting word forms based on morphological relational
    reasoning with analogies. While previous work has explored tasks such as morphological
    inflection and reinflection, these models rely on an explicit enumeration of morphological
    features, which may not be available in all cases. To address the task of predicting
    a word form given a demo relation (a pair of word forms) and a query word, we
    devise a character-based recurrent neural network architecture using three separate
    encoders and a decoder. We also investigate a multiclass learning setup, where
    the prediction of the relation type label is used as an auxiliary task. Our results
    show that the exact form can be predicted for English with an accuracy of 94.7%.
    For Swedish, which has a more complex morphology with more inflectional patterns
    for nouns and verbs, the accuracy is 89.3%. We also show that using the auxiliary
    task of learning the relation type speeds up convergence and improves the prediction
    accuracy for the word generation task.

  abstract: Recently, neural models have shown superior performance over conventional
    models in NER tasks. These models use CNN to extract sub-word information along
    with RNN to predict a tag for each word. However, these models have been tested
    almost entirely on English texts. It remains unclear whether they perform similarly
    in other languages. We worked on Japanese NER using neural models and discovered
    two obstacles of the state-of-the-art model. First, CNN is unsuitable for extracting
    Japanese sub-word information. Secondly, a model predicting a tag for each word
    cannot extract an entity when a part of a word composes an entity. The contributions
    of this work are (1) verifying the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art NER model
    for Japanese, (2) proposing a neural model for predicting a tag for each character
    using word and character information. Experimentally obtained results demonstrate
    that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art neural English NER model in Japanese.

  abstract: Out-of-vocabulary words present a great challenge for Machine Translation.
    Recently various character-level compositional models were proposed to address
    this issue. In current research we incorporate two most popular neural architectures,
    namely LSTM and CNN, into hard- and soft-attentional models of translation for
    character-level representation of the source. We propose semantic and morphological
    intrinsic evaluation of encoder-level representations. Our analysis of the learned
    representations reveals that character-based LSTM seems to be better at capturing
    morphological aspects compared to character-based CNN. We also show that hard-attentional
    model provides better character-level representations compared to vanilla one.

  abstract: 'There are several native languages in Peru which are mostly agglutinative.
    These languages are transmitted from generation to generation mainly in oral form,
    causing different forms of writing across different communities. For this reason,
    there are recent efforts to standardize the spelling in the written texts, and
    it would be beneficial to support these tasks with an automatic tool such as an
    spell-checker. In this way, this spelling corrector is being developed based on
    two steps: an automatic rule-based syllabification method and a character-level
    graph to detect the degree of error in a misspelled word. The experiments were
    realized on Shipibo-konibo, a highly agglutinative and amazonian language, and
    the results obtained have been promising in a dataset built for the purpose.'

  abstract: We propose a new type of subword embedding designed to provide more information
    about unknown compounds, a major source for OOV words in German. We present an
    extrinsic evaluation where we use the compound embeddings as input to a neural
    dependency parser and compare the results to the ones obtained with other types
    of embeddings. Our evaluation shows that adding compound embeddings yields a significant
    improvement of 2% LAS over using word embeddings when no POS information is available.
    When adding POS embeddings to the input, however, the effect levels out. This
    suggests that it is not the missing information about the semantics of the unknown
    words that causes problems for parsing German, but the lack of morphological information
    for unknown words. To augment our evaluation, we also test the new embeddings
    in a language modelling task that requires both syntactic and semantic information.

    The CNN tagger is robust across different tagging tasks: without task-specific

    at the cost of increasing the model size. We propose to benefit from this resource

    is quite simple: before task-specific training, we first optimize sub-word parameters

  abstract: "We present a novel supervised approach to inflection generation for verbs\
    \ in Spanish. Our system takes as input the verb\u2019s lemma form and the desired\
    \ features such as person, number, tense, and is able to predict the appropriate\
    \ grammatical conjugation. Even though our approach learns from fewer examples\
    \ comparing to previous work, it is able to deal with all the Spanish moods (indicative,\
    \ subjunctive and imperative) in contrast to previous work which only focuses\
    \ on indicative and subjunctive moods. We show that in an intrinsic evaluation,\
    \ our system achieves 99% accuracy, outperforming (although not significantly)\
    \ two competitive state-of-art systems. The successful results obtained clearly\
    \ indicate that our approach could be integrated into wider approaches related\
    \ to text generation in Spanish."

  abstract: We present a solution to the problem of paraphrase identification of questions.
    We focus on a recent dataset of question pairs annotated with binary paraphrase
    labels and show that a variant of the decomposable attention model (replacing
    the word embeddings of the decomposable attention model of Parikh et al. 2016
    with character n-gram representations) results in accurate performance on this
    task, while being far simpler than many competing neural architectures. Furthermore,
    when the model is pretrained on a noisy dataset of automatically collected question
    paraphrases, it obtains the best reported performance on the dataset.

  abstract: In East Asian languages such as Japanese and Chinese, the semantics of
    a character are (somewhat) reflected in its sub-character elements. This paper
    examines the effect of using sub-characters for language modeling in Japanese.
    This is achieved by decomposing characters according to a range of character decomposition
    datasets, and training a neural language model over variously decomposed character
    representations. Our results indicate that language modelling can be improved
    through the inclusion of sub-characters, though this result depends on a good
    choice of decomposition dataset and the appropriate granularity of decomposition.

  abstract: This paper presents experiments comparing character-based and byte-based
    neural machine translation systems. The main motivation of the byte-based neural
    machine translation system is to build multi-lingual neural machine translation
    systems that can share the same vocabulary. We compare the performance of both
    systems in several language pairs and we see that the performance in test is similar
    for most language pairs while the training time is slightly reduced in the case
    of byte-based neural machine translation.

    \ embeddings and show their positive impact on the system\u2019s performance.\
    \ Specifically, we obtain an increase by 3.3 points F1-score with respect to our\

  abstract: This paper addresses the task of identifying the bias in news articles
    published during a political or social conflict. We create a silver-standard corpus
    based on the actions of users in social media. Specifically, we reconceptualize
    bias in terms of how likely a given article is to be shared or liked by each of
    the opposing sides. We apply our methodology to a dataset of links collected in
    relation to the Russia-Ukraine Maidan crisis from 2013-2014. We show that on the
    task of predicting which side is likely to prefer a given article, a Naive Bayes
    classifier can record 90.3% accuracy looking only at domain names of the news
    sources. The best accuracy of 93.5% is achieved by a feed forward neural network.
    We also apply our methodology to gold-labeled set of articles annotated for bias,
    where the aforementioned Naive Bayes classifier records 82.6% accuracy and a feed-forward
    neural networks records 85.6% accuracy.

  abstract: News media typically present biased accounts of news stories, and different
    publications present different angles on the same event. In this research, we
    investigate how different publications differ in their approach to stories about
    climate change, by examining the sentiment and topics presented. To understand
    these attitudes, we find sentiment targets by combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    (LDA) with SentiWordNet, a general sentiment lexicon. Using LDA, we generate topics
    containing keywords which represent the sentiment targets, and then annotate the
    data using SentiWordNet before regrouping the articles based on topic similarity.
    Preliminary analysis identifies clearly different attitudes on the same issue
    presented in different news sources. Ongoing work is investigating how systematic
    these attitudes are between different publications, and how these may change over
    time.

  abstract: Faced with ever-growing news archives, media professionals are in need
    of advanced tools to explore the information surrounding specific events. This
    problem is most commonly answered by browsing news datasets, going from article
    to article and viewing unaltered original content. In this article, we introduce
    an efficient way to generate links between news items, allowing such browsing
    through an easily explorable graph, and enrich this graph by automatically typing
    links in order to inform the user on the nature of the relation between two news
    pieces. User evaluations are conducted on real world data with journalists in
    order to assess for the interest of both the graph representation and link typing
    in a press reviewing task, showing the system to be of significant help for their
    work.

  abstract: Complexity of event data in texts makes it difficult to assess its content,
    especially when considering larger collections in which different sources report
    on the same or similar situations. We present a system that makes it possible
    to visually analyze complex event and emotion data extracted from texts. We show
    that we can abstract from different data models for events and emotions to a single
    data model that can show the complex relations in four dimensions. The visualization
    has been applied to analyze 1) dynamic developments in how people both conceive
    and express emotions in theater plays and 2) how stories are told from the perspectyive
    of their sources based on rich event data extracted from news or biographies.

    revision logs from a Japanese newspaper company. The revision logs contain data
    that can help reveal the requirements of quality journalism such as the types
    and number of edit operations and aspects commonly focused in revision. This study
    also discusses potential applications such as quality assessment and automatic
    article revision as our future research directions.

  abstract: 'This paper discusses the problem of incongruent headlines: those which
    do not accurately represent the information contained in the article with which
    they occur. We emphasise that this phenomenon should be considered separately
    from recognised problematic headline types such as clickbait and sensationalism,
    arguing that existing natural language processing (NLP) methods applied to these
    related concepts are not appropriate for the automatic detection of headline incongruence,
    as an analysis beyond stylistic traits is necessary. We therefore suggest a number
    of alternative methodologies that may be appropriate to the task at hand as a
    foundation for future work in this area. In addition, we provide an analysis of
    existing data sets which are related to this work, and motivate the need for a
    novel data set in this domain.'

  abstract: We present a prototypical content curation dashboard, to be used in the
    newsroom, and several of its underlying semantic content analysis components (such
    as named entity recognition, entity linking, summarisation and temporal expression
    analysis). The idea is to enable journalists (a) to process incoming content (agency
    reports, twitter feeds, reports, blog posts, social media etc.) and (b) to create
    new articles more easily and more efficiently. The prototype system also allows
    the automatic annotation of events in incoming content for the purpose of supporting
    journalists in identifying important, relevant or meaningful events and also to
    adapt the content currently in production accordingly in a semi-automatic way.
    One of our long-term goals is to support journalists building up entire storylines
    with automatic means. In the present prototype they are generated in a backend
    service using clustering methods that operate on the extracted events.

  abstract: 'News verification and automated fact checking tend to be very important
    issues in our world. The research is initial. We collected a corpus for Russian
    (174 news reports, truthful and fake ones). We held two experiments, for both
    we applied SVMs algorithm (linear/rbf kernel) and Random Forest to classify the
    news reports into 2 classes: truthful/deceptive. In the first experiment, we used
    18 markers on lexics level, mostly frequencies of POS tags in texts. In the second
    experiment, on discourse level we used frequencies of rhetorical relations types
    in texts. The classification task in the first experiment is solved better by
    SVMs (rbf kernel) (f-measure 0.65). The model based on RST features shows best
    results with Random Forest Classifier (f-measure 0.54) and should be modified.
    In the next research, the combination of different deception detection markers
    for the Russian language should be taken in order to make a better predictive
    model.'

  abstract: "Fake news has become a hotly debated topic in journalism. In this paper,\
    \ we present our entry to the 2017 Fake News Challenge which models the detection\
    \ of fake news as a stance classification task that finished in 11th place on\
    \ the leader board. Our entry is an ensemble system of classifiers developed by\
    \ students in the context of their coursework. We show how we used the stacking\
    \ ensemble method for this purpose and obtained improvements in classification\
    \ accuracy exceeding each of the individual models\u2019 performance on the development\
    \ data. Finally, we discuss aspects of the experimental setup of the challenge."

  abstract: We present a system for the detection of the stance of headlines with
    regard to their corresponding article bodies. The approach can be applied in fake
    news, especially clickbait detection scenarios. The component is part of a larger
    platform for the curation of digital content; we consider veracity and relevancy
    an increasingly important part of curating online information. We want to contribute
    to the debate on how to deal with fake news and related online phenomena with
    technological means, by providing means to separate related from unrelated headlines
    and further classifying the related headlines. On a publicly available data set
    annotated for the stance of headlines with regard to their corresponding article
    bodies, we achieve a (weighted) accuracy score of 89.59.

  abstract: 'Previous work on the epistemology of fact-checking indicated the dilemma
    between the needs of binary answers for the public and ambiguity of political
    discussion. Determining concepts represented by terms in political discourse can
    be considered as a Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task. The analysis of political
    discourse, however, requires identifying precise concepts of terms from relatively
    small data. This work attempts to provide a basic framework for revealing concepts
    of terms in political discourse with explicit contextual information. The framework
    consists of three parts: 1) extracting important terms, 2) generating concordance
    for each term with stipulative definitions and explanations, and 3) agglomerating
    similar information of the term by hierarchical clustering. Utterances made by
    Prime Minister Abe Shinzo in the Diet of Japan are used to examine our framework.
    Importantly, we revealed the conceptual inconsistency of the term Sonritsu-kiki-jitai.
    The framework was proved to work, but only for a small number of terms due to
    lack of explicit contextual information.'

  abstract: The discrepancy between science and media has been affecting the effectiveness
    of science communication. Original findings from science publications may be distorted
    with altered claim strength when reported to the public, causing misinformation
    spread. This study conducts an NLP analysis of exaggerated claims in science news,
    and then constructed prediction models for identifying claim strength levels in
    science reporting. The results demonstrate different writing styles journal articles
    and news/press releases use for reporting scientific findings. Preliminary prediction
    models reached promising result with room for further improvement.

  abstract: "Dependency parses are an effective way to inject linguistic knowledge\
    \ into many downstream tasks, and many practitioners wish to efficiently parse\
    \ sentences at scale. Recent advances in GPU hardware have enabled neural networks\
    \ to achieve significant gains over the previous best models, these models still\
    \ fail to leverage GPUs\u2019 capability for massive parallelism due to their\

    \ Dilated Iterated Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DIG-CNNs) for graph-based\
    \ dependency parsing, a graph convolutional architecture that allows for efficient\
    \ end-to-end GPU parsing. In experiments on the English Penn TreeBank benchmark,\

  abstract: 'Standard approaches in entity identification hard-code boundary detection
    and type prediction into labels and perform Viterbi. This has two disadvantages:
    1. the runtime complexity grows quadratically in the number of types, and 2. there
    is no natural segment-level representation. In this paper, we propose a neural
    architecture that addresses these disadvantages. We frame the problem as multitasking,
    separating boundary detection and type prediction but optimizing them jointly.
    Despite its simplicity, this architecture performs competitively with fully structured
    models such as BiLSTM-CRFs while scaling linearly in the number of types. Furthermore,
    by construction, the model induces type-disambiguating embeddings of predicted
    mentions.'

  abstract: Building models that take advantage of the hierarchical structure of language
    without a priori annotation is a longstanding goal in natural language processing.
    We introduce such a model for the task of machine translation, pairing a recurrent
    neural network grammar encoder with a novel attentional RNNG decoder and applying
    policy gradient reinforcement learning to induce unsupervised tree structures
    on both the source and target. When trained on character-level datasets with no
    explicit segmentation or parse annotation, the model learns a plausible segmentation
    and shallow parse, obtaining performance close to an attentional baseline.

  abstract: 'We present an algorithm for structured prediction under online bandit
    feedback. The learner repeatedly predicts a sequence of actions, generating a
    structured output. It then observes feedback for that output and no others. We
    consider two cases: a pure bandit setting in which it only observes a loss, and
    more fine-grained feedback in which it observes a loss for every action. We find
    that the fine-grained feedback is necessary for strong empirical performance,
    because it allows for a robust variance-reduction strategy. We empirically compare
    a number of different algorithms and exploration methods and show the efficacy
    of BLS on sequence labeling and dependency parsing tasks.'

  abstract: In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task, the tree structured dependency relation
    is rich in syntax information, but it is not well handled by existing models.
    In this paper, we propose Syntax Aware Long Short Time Memory (SA-LSTM). The structure
    of SA-LSTM changes according to dependency structure of each sentence, so that
    SA-LSTM can model the whole tree structure of dependency relation in an architecture
    engineering way. Experiments demonstrate that on Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB)
    1.0, SA-LSTM improves F1 by 2.06% than ordinary bi-LSTM with feature engineered
    dependency relation information, and gives state-of-the-art F1 of 79.92%. On English
    CoNLL 2005 dataset, SA-LSTM brings improvement (2.1%) to bi-LSTM model and also
    brings slight improvement (0.3%) when added to the state-of-the-art model.

  abstract: This work is on a previously formalized semantic evaluation task of spatial
    role labeling (SpRL) that aims at extraction of formal spatial meaning from text.
    Here, we report the results of initial efforts towards exploiting visual information
    in the form of images to help spatial language understanding. We discuss the way
    of designing new models in the framework of declarative learning-based programming
    (DeLBP). The DeLBP framework facilitates combining modalities and representing
    various data in a unified graph. The learning and inference models exploit the
    structure of the unified graph as well as the global first order domain constraints
    beyond the data to predict the semantics which forms a structured meaning representation
    of the spatial context. Continuous representations are used to relate the various
    elements of the graph originating from different modalities. We improved over
    the state-of-the-art results on SpRL.

  abstract: We present an architecture to boost the precision of existing information
    extraction systems. This is achieved by augmenting the existing parser, which
    may be constraint-based or hybrid statistical, with a character-level neural network.
    Our architecture combines the ability of constraint-based or hybrid extraction
    systems to easily incorporate domain knowledge with the ability of deep neural
    networks to leverage large amounts of data to learn complex features. The network
    is trained using a measure of consistency between extracted data and existing
    databases as a form of cheap, noisy supervision. Our architecture does not require
    large scale manual annotation or a system rewrite. It has led to large precision
    improvements over an existing, highly-tuned production information extraction
    system used at Bloomberg LP for financial language text.

  abstract: Advances in neural variational inference have facilitated the learning
    of powerful directed graphical models with continuous latent variables, such as
    variational autoencoders. The hope is that such models will learn to represent
    rich, multi-modal latent factors in real-world data, such as natural language
    text. However, current models often assume simplistic priors on the latent variables
    - such as the uni-modal Gaussian distribution - which are incapable of representing
    complex latent factors efficiently. To overcome this restriction, we propose the
    simple, but highly flexible, piecewise constant distribution. This distribution
    has the capacity to represent an exponential number of modes of a latent target
    distribution, while remaining mathematically tractable. Our results demonstrate
    that incorporating this new latent distribution into different models yields substantial
    improvements in natural language processing tasks such as document modeling and
    natural language generation for dialogue.

  abstract: This submission describes the development of a fine-grained, text-chunking
    algorithm for the task of comprehensive MWE segmentation. This task notably focuses
    on the identification of colloquial and idiomatic language. The submission also
    includes a thorough model evaluation in the context of two recent shared tasks,
    spanning 19 different languages and many text domains, including noisy, user-generated
    text. Evaluations exhibit the presented model as the best overall for purposes
    of MWE segmentation, and open-source software is released with the submission
    (although links are withheld for purposes of anonymity). Additionally, the authors
    acknowledge the existence of a pre-print document on arxiv.org, which should be
    avoided to maintain anonymity in review.

  abstract: 'Videogame streaming platforms have become a paramount example of noisy
    user-generated text. These are websites where gaming is broadcasted, and allows
    interaction with viewers via integrated chatrooms. Probably the best known platform
    of this kind is Twitch, which has more than 100 million monthly viewers. Despite
    these numbers, and unlike other platforms featuring short messages (e.g. Twitter),
    Twitch has not received much attention from the Natural Language Processing community.
    In this paper we aim at bridging this gap by proposing two important tasks specific
    to the Twitch platform, namely (1) Emote prediction; and (2) Trolling detection.
    In our experiments, we evaluate three models: a BOW baseline, a logistic supervised
    classifiers based on word embeddings, and a bidirectional long short-term memory
    recurrent neural network (LSTM). Our results show that the LSTM model outperforms
    the other two models, where explicit features with proven effectiveness for similar
    tasks were encoded.'

  abstract: For brands, gaining new customer is more expensive than keeping an existing
    one. Therefore, the ability to keep customers in a brand is becoming more challenging
    these days. Churn happens when a customer leaves a brand to another competitor.
    Most of the previous work considers the problem of churn prediction using the
    Call Detail Records (CDRs). In this paper, we use micro-posts to classify customers
    into churny or non-churny. We explore the power of convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) since they achieved state-of-the-art in various computer vision and NLP
    applications. However, the robustness of end-to-end models has some limitations
    such as the availability of a large amount of labeled data and uninterpretability
    of these models. We investigate the use of CNNs augmented with structured logic
    rules to overcome or reduce this issue. We developed our system called Churn_teacher
    by using an iterative distillation method that transfers the knowledge, extracted
    using just the combination of three logic rules, directly into the weight of the
    DNNs. Furthermore, we used weight normalization to speed up training our convolutional
    neural networks. Experimental results showed that with just these three rules,
    we were able to get state-of-the-art on publicly available Twitter dataset about
    three Telecom brands.

  abstract: Does normalization help Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging accuracy on noisy,
    non-canonical data? To the best of our knowledge, little is known on the actual
    impact of normalization in a real-world scenario, where gold error detection is
    not available. We investigate the effect of automatic normalization on POS tagging
    of tweets. We also compare normalization to strategies that leverage large amounts
    of unlabeled data kept in its raw form. Our results show that normalization helps,
    but does not add consistently beyond just word embedding layer initialization.
    The latter approach yields a tagging model that is competitive with a Twitter
    state-of-the-art tagger.

  abstract: In certain fields, real-time knowledge from events can help in making
    informed decisions. In order to extract pertinent real-time knowledge related
    to an event, it is important to identify the named entities and their corresponding
    aliases related to the event. The problem of identifying aliases of named entities
    that spike has remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm,
    EntitySpike, that identifies entities that spike in popularity in tweets from
    a given time period, and constructs an alias list for these spiked entities. EntitySpike
    uses a temporal heuristic to identify named entities with similar context that
    occur in the same time period (within minutes) during an event. Each entity is
    encoded as a vector using this temporal heuristic. We show how these entity-vectors
    can be used to create a named entity alias list. We evaluated our algorithm on
    a dataset of temporally ordered tweets from a single event, the 2013 Grammy Awards
    show. We carried out various experiments on tweets that were published in the
    same time period and show that our algorithm identifies most entity name aliases
    and outperforms a competitive baseline.

  abstract: Low-dimensional vector representations of social media users can benefit
    applications like recommendation systems and user attribute inference. Recent
    work has shown that user embeddings can be improved by combining different types
    of information, such as text and network data. We propose a data augmentation
    method that allows novel feature types to be used within off-the-shelf embedding
    models. Experimenting with the task of friend recommendation on a dataset of 5,019
    Twitter users, we show that our approach can lead to substantial performance gains
    with the simple addition of network and geographic features.

  abstract: The majority of research on extracting missing user attributes from social
    media profiles use costly hand-annotated labels for supervised learning. Distantly
    supervised methods exist, although these generally rely on knowledge gathered
    using external sources. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of gathering
    distant labels for self-reported gender on Twitter using simple queries. We confirm
    the reliability of this query heuristic by comparing with manual annotation. Moreover,
    using these labels for distant supervision, we demonstrate competitive model performance
    on the same data as models trained on manual annotations. As such, we offer a
    cheap, extensible, and fast alternative that can be employed beyond the task of
    gender classification.

  abstract: "While language identification works well on standard texts, it performs\
    \ much worse on social media language, in particular dialectal language\u2014\
    even for English. First, to support work on English language identification, we\
    \ contribute a new dataset of tweets annotated for English versus non-English,\
    \ with attention to ambiguity, code-switching, and automatic generation issues.\
    \ It is randomly sampled from all public messages, avoiding biases towards pre-existing\
    \ language classifiers. Second, we find that a demographic language model\u2014\
    which identifies messages with language similar to that used by several U.S. ethnic\
    \ populations on Twitter\u2014can be used to improve English language identification\
    \ performance when combined with a traditional supervised language identifier.\
    \ It increases recall with almost no loss of precision, including, surprisingly,\
    \ for English messages written by non-U.S. authors. Our dataset and identifier\
    \ ensemble are available online."

  abstract: Recent work in geolocation has made several hypotheses about what linguistic
    markers are relevant to detect where people write from. In this paper, we examine
    six hypotheses against a corpus consisting of all geo-tagged tweets from the US,
    or whose geo-tags could be inferred, in a 19% sample of Twitter history. Our experiments
    lend support to all six hypotheses, including that spelling variants and hashtags
    are strong predictors of location. We also study what kinds of common nouns are
    predictive of location after controlling for named entities such as dolphins or
    sharks

  abstract: Uyghur is the second largest and most actively used social media language
    in China. However, a non-negligible part of Uyghur text appearing in social media
    is unsystematically written with the Latin alphabet, and it continues to increase
    in size. Uyghur text in this format is incomprehensible and ambiguous even to
    native Uyghur speakers. In addition, Uyghur texts in this form lack the potential
    for any kind of advancement for the NLP tasks related to the Uyghur language.
    Restoring and preventing noisy Uyghur text written with unsystematic Latin alphabets
    will be essential to the protection of Uyghur language and improving the accuracy
    of Uyghur NLP tasks. To this purpose, in this work we propose and compare the
    noisy channel model and the neural encoder-decoder model as normalizing methods.

  abstract: We present a novel method for obtaining high-quality, domain-targeted
    multiple choice questions from crowd workers. Generating these questions can be
    difficult without trading away originality, relevance or diversity in the answer
    options. Our method addresses these problems by leveraging a large corpus of domain-specific
    text and a small set of existing questions. It produces model suggestions for
    document selection and answer distractor choice which aid the human question generation
    process. With this method we have assembled SciQ, a dataset of 13.7K multiple
    choice science exam questions. We demonstrate that the method produces in-domain
    questions by providing an analysis of this new dataset and by showing that humans
    cannot distinguish the crowdsourced questions from original questions. When using
    SciQ as additional training data to existing questions, we observe accuracy improvements
    on real science exams.

  abstract: "This paper investigates the problem of text normalisation; specifically,\
    \ the normalisation of non-standard words (NSWs) in English. Non-standard words\
    \ can be defined as those word tokens which do not have a dictionary entry, and\
    \ cannot be pronounced using the usual letter-to-phoneme conversion rules; e.g.\
    \ lbs, 99.3%, #EMNLP2017. NSWs pose a challenge to the proper functioning of text-to-speech\
    \ technology, and the solution is to spell them out in such a way that they can\
    \ be pronounced appropriately. We describe our four-stage normalisation system\
    \ made up of components for detection, classification, division and expansion\
    \ of NSWs. Performance is favourabe compared to previous work in the field (Sproat\
    \ et al. 2001, Normalization of non-standard words), as well as state-of-the-art\
    \ text-to-speech software. Further, we update Sproat et al.\u2019s NSW taxonomy,\
    \ and create a more customisable system where users are able to input their own\
    \ abbreviations and specify into which variety of English (currently available:\
    \ British or American) they wish to normalise."

  abstract: Technical documents contain a fair amount of unnatural language, such
    as tables, formulas, and pseudo-code. Unnatural language can bean important factor
    of confusing existing NLP tools. This paper presents an effective method of distinguishing
    unnatural language from natural language, and evaluates the impact of un-natural
    language detection on NLP tasks such as document clustering. We view this problem
    as an information extraction task and build a multiclass classification model
    identifying unnatural language components into four categories. First, we create
    a new annotated corpus by collecting slides and papers in various for-mats, PPT,
    PDF, and HTML, where unnatural language components are annotated into four categories.
    We then explore features available from plain text to build a statistical model
    that can handle any format as long as it is converted into plain text. Our experiments
    show that re-moving unnatural language components gives an absolute improvement
    in document cluster-ing by up to 15%. Our corpus and tool are publicly available

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the Lithium Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    system - a resource-constrained, high-throughput and language-agnostic system
    for information extraction from noisy user generated text on social media. Lithium
    NLP extracts a rich set of information including entities, topics, hashtags and
    sentiment from text. We discuss several real world applications of the system
    currently incorporated in Lithium products. We also compare our system with existing
    commercial and academic NLP systems in terms of performance, information extracted
    and languages supported. We show that Lithium NLP is at par with and in some cases,
    outperforms state-of-the-art commercial NLP systems.

  abstract: "This shared task focuses on identifying unusual, previously-unseen entities\
    \ in the context of emerging discussions. Named entities form the basis of many\
    \ modern approaches to other tasks (like event clustering and summarization),\
    \ but recall on them is a real problem in noisy text - even among annotators.\
    \ This drop tends to be due to novel entities and surface forms. Take for example\
    \ the tweet \u201Cso.. kktny in 30 mins?!\u201D \u2013 even human experts find\
    \ the entity \u2018kktny\u2019 hard to detect and resolve. The goal of this task\
    \ is to provide a definition of emerging and of rare entities, and based on that,\
    \ also datasets for detecting these entities. The task as described in this paper\

  abstract: Named Entity Recognition for social media data is challenging because
    of its inherent noisiness. In addition to improper grammatical structures, it
    contains spelling inconsistencies and numerous informal abbreviations. We propose
    a novel multi-task approach by employing a more general secondary task of Named
    Entity (NE) segmentation together with the primary task of fine-grained NE categorization.
    The multi-task neural network architecture learns higher order feature representations
    from word and character sequences along with basic Part-of-Speech tags and gazetteer
    information. This neural network acts as a feature extractor to feed a Conditional
    Random Fields classifier. We were able to obtain the first position in the 3rd
    Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (WNUT-2017) with a 41.86% entity F1-score
    and a 40.24% surface F1-score.

  abstract: This paper reports our participation in the W-NUT 2017 shared task on
    emerging and rare entity recognition from user generated noisy text such as tweets,
    online reviews and forum discussions. To accomplish this challenging task, we
    explore an approach that combines LDA topic modelling with deep learning on word
    level and character level embeddings. The LDA topic modelling generates topic
    representation for each tweet which is used as a feature for each word in the
    tweet. The deep learning component consists of two-layer bidirectional LSTM and
    a CRF output layer. Our submitted result performed at 39.98 (F1) on entity and
    37.77 on surface forms. Our new experiments after submission reached a best performance
    of 41.81 on entity and 40.57 on surface forms.

  abstract: In this paper, we present our multi-channel neural architecture for recognizing
    emerging named entity in social media messages, which we applied in the Novel
    and Emerging Named Entity Recognition shared task at the EMNLP 2017 Workshop on
    Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT). We propose a novel approach, which incorporates
    comprehensive word representations with multi-channel information and Conditional
    Random Fields (CRF) into a traditional Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
    neural network without using any additional hand-craft features such as gazetteers.
    In comparison with other systems participating in the shared task, our system
    won the 2nd place.

  abstract: We present our system for the WNUT 2017 Named Entity Recognition challenge
    on Twitter data. We describe two modifications of a basic neural network architecture
    for sequence tagging. First, we show how we exploit additional labeled data, where
    the Named Entity tags differ from the target task. Then, we propose a way to incorporate
    sentence level features. Our system uses both methods and ranked second for entity
    level annotations, achieving an F1-score of 40.78, and second for surface form
    annotations, achieving an F1-score of 39.33.

  abstract: Detecting previously unseen named entities in text is a challenging task.
    The paper describes how three initial classifier models were built using Conditional
    Random Fields (CRFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The outputs of these three classifiers were then
    used as features to train another CRF classifier working as an ensemble. 5-fold
    cross-validation based on training and development data for the emerging and rare
    named entity recognition shared task showed precision, recall and F1-score of
    66.87%, 46.75% and 54.97%, respectively. For surface form evaluation, the CRF
    ensemble-based system achieved precision, recall and F1 scores of 65.18%, 45.20%
    and 53.30%. When applied to unseen test data, the model reached 47.92% precision,
    31.97% recall and 38.55% F1-score for entity level evaluation, with the corresponding
    surface form evaluation values of 44.91%, 30.47% and 36.31%.

  abstract: 'With the prevalence of video sharing, there are increasing demands for
    automatic video digestion such as highlight detection. Recently, platforms with
    crowdsourced time-sync video comments have emerged worldwide, providing a good
    opportunity for highlight detection. However, this task is non-trivial: (1) time-sync
    comments often lag behind their corresponding shot; (2) time-sync comments are
    semantically sparse and noisy; (3) to determine which shots are highlights is
    highly subjective. The present paper aims to tackle these challenges by proposing
    a framework that (1) uses concept-mapped lexical-chains for lag-calibration; (2)
    models video highlights based on comment intensity and combination of emotion
    and concept concentration of each shot; (3) summarize each detected highlight
    using improved SumBasic with emotion and concept mapping. Experiments on large
    real-world datasets show that our highlight detection method and summarization
    method both outperform other benchmarks with considerable margins.'

  abstract: With the proliferation of Web-based social media, asynchronous conversations
    have become very common for supporting online communication and collaboration.
    Yet the increasing volume and complexity of conversational data often make it
    very difficult to get insights about the discussions. We consider combining textual
    summary with visual representation of conversational data as a promising way of
    supporting the user in exploring conversations. In this paper, we report our current
    work on developing visual interfaces that present multimedia summary combining
    text and visualization for online conversations and how our solutions have been
    tailored for a variety of domain problems. We then discuss the key challenges
    and opportunities for future work in this research space.

  abstract: Abstractive summarization, the task of rewriting and compressing a document
    into a short summary, has achieved considerable success with neural sequence-to-sequence
    models. However, these models can still benefit from stronger natural language
    inference skills, since a correct summary is logically entailed by the input document,
    i.e., it should not contain any contradictory or unrelated information. We incorporate
    such knowledge into an abstractive summarization model via multi-task learning,
    where we share its decoder parameters with those of an entailment generation model.
    We achieve promising initial improvements based on multiple metrics and datasets
    (including a test-only setting). The domain mismatch between the entailment (captions)
    and summarization (news) datasets suggests that the model is learning some domain-agnostic
    inference skills.

  abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models with attention have been successful for a
    variety of NLP problems, but their speed does not scale well for tasks with long
    source sequences such as document summarization. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine
    attention model that hierarchically reads a document, using coarse attention to
    select top-level chunks of text and fine attention to read the words of the chosen
    chunks. While the computation for training standard attention models scales linearly
    with source sequence length, our method scales with the number of top-level chunks
    and can handle much longer sequences. Empirically, we find that while coarse-to-fine
    attention models lag behind state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves the
    desired behavior of sparsely attending to subsets of the document for generation.

  abstract: 'Summarization of spoken conversations is a challenging task, since it
    requires deep understanding of dialogs. Abstractive summarization techniques rely
    on linking the summary sentences to sets of original conversation sentences, i.e.
    communities. Unfortunately, such linking information is rarely available or requires
    trained annotators. We propose and experiment automatic community creation using
    cosine similarity on different levels of representation: raw text, WordNet SynSet
    IDs, and word embeddings. We show that the abstractive summarization systems with
    automatic communities significantly outperform previously published results on
    both English and Italian corpora.'

  abstract: We present a fully unsupervised, extractive text summarization system
    that leverages a submodularity framework introduced by past research. The framework
    allows summaries to be generated in a greedy way while preserving near-optimal
    performance guarantees. Our main contribution is the novel coverage reward term
    of the objective function optimized by the greedy algorithm. This component builds
    on the graph-of-words representation of text and the k-core decomposition algorithm
    to assign meaningful scores to words. We evaluate our approach on the AMI and
    ICSI meeting speech corpora, and on the DUC2001 news corpus. We reach state-of-the-art
    performance on all datasets. Results indicate that our method is particularly
    well-suited to the meeting domain.

  abstract: "Recent advances in automatic text summarization have used deep neural\
    \ networks to generate high-quality abstractive summaries, but the performance\
    \ of these models strongly depends on large amounts of suitable training data.\
    \ We propose a new method for mining social media for author-provided summaries,\
    \ taking advantage of the common practice of appending a \u201CTL;DR\u201D to\
    \ long posts. A case study using a large Reddit crawl yields the Webis-TLDR-17\

  abstract: The evaluation of summaries is a challenging but crucial task of the summarization
    field. In this work, we propose to learn an automatic scoring metric based on
    the human judgements available as part of classical summarization datasets like
    TAC-2008 and TAC-2009. Any existing automatic scoring metrics can be included
    as features, the model learns the combination exhibiting the best correlation
    with human judgments. The reliability of the new metric is tested in a further
    manual evaluation where we ask humans to evaluate summaries covering the whole
    scoring spectrum of the metric. We release the trained metric as an open-source
    tool.

  abstract: The centroid-based model for extractive document summarization is a simple
    and fast baseline that ranks sentences based on their similarity to a centroid
    vector. In this paper, we apply this ranking to possible summaries instead of
    sentences and use a simple greedy algorithm to find the best summary. Furthermore,
    we show possibilities to scale up to larger input document collections by selecting
    a small number of sentences from each document prior to constructing the summary.
    Experiments were done on the DUC2004 dataset for multi-document summarization.
    We observe a higher performance over the original model, on par with more complex
    state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract: We investigate the problem of reader-aware multi-document summarization
    (RA-MDS) and introduce a new dataset for this problem. To tackle RA-MDS, we extend
    a variational auto-encodes (VAEs) based MDS framework by jointly considering news
    documents and reader comments. To conduct evaluation for summarization performance,
    we prepare a new dataset. We describe the methods for data collection, aspect
    annotation, and summary writing as well as scrutinizing by experts. Experimental
    results show that reader comments can improve the summarization performance, which
    also demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed dataset.

  abstract: We study the problem of domain adaptation for neural abstractive summarization.
    We make initial efforts in investigating what information can be transferred to
    a new domain. Experimental results on news stories and opinion articles indicate
    that neural summarization model benefits from pre-training based on extractive
    summaries. We also find that the combination of in-domain and out-of-domain setup
    yields better summaries when in-domain data is insufficient. Further analysis
    shows that, the model is capable to select salient content even trained on out-of-domain
    data, but requires in-domain data to capture the style for a target domain.

  abstract: "Silence is an integral part of the most frequent turn-taking phenomena\
    \ in spoken conversations. Silence is sized and placed within the conversation\
    \ flow and it is coordinated by the speakers along with the other speech acts.\
    \ The objective of this analytical study is twofold: to explore the functions\
    \ of silence with duration of one second and above, towards information flow in\
    \ a dyadic conversation utilizing the sequences of dialog acts present in the\
    \ turns surrounding the silence itself; and to design a feature space useful for\
    \ clustering the silences using a hierarchical concept formation algorithm. The\
    \ resulting clusters are manually grouped into functional categories based on\
    \ their similarities. It is observed that the silence plays an important role\
    \ in response preparation, also can indicate speakers\u2019 hesitation or indecisiveness.\
    \ It is also observed that sometimes long silences can be used deliberately to\
    \ get a forced response from another speaker thus making silence a multi-functional\
    \ and an important catalyst towards information flow."

    which can represent a rich hypothesis space of automatic speech recognition systems,
    via recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach for
    the task of dialog state tracking in spoken dialog systems that relies on automatic
    speech recognition output. Encoding confusion networks outperforms encoding the
    best hypothesis of the automatic speech recognition in a neural system for dialog
    state tracking on the well-known second Dialog State Tracking Challenge dataset.

  abstract: 'Written sentences can be more ambiguous than spoken sentences. We investigate
    this difference for two different types of ambiguity: prepositional phrase (PP)
    attachment and sentences where the addition of commas changes the meaning. We
    recorded a native English speaker saying several of each type of sentence both
    with and without disambiguating contextual information. These sentences were then
    presented either as text or audio and either with or without context to subjects
    who were asked to select the proper interpretation of the sentence. Results suggest
    that comma-ambiguous sentences are easier to disambiguate than PP-attachment-ambiguous
    sentences, possibly due to the presence of clear prosodic boundaries, namely silent
    pauses. Subject performance for sentences with PP-attachment ambiguity without
    context was 52% for text only while it was 72.4% for audio only, suggesting that
    audio has more disambiguating information than text. Using an analysis of acoustic
    features of two PP-attachment sentences, a simple classifier was implemented to
    resolve the PP-attachment ambiguity being early or late closure with a mean accuracy
    of 80%.'

  abstract: We present an analysis of parser performance on speech data, comparing
    word type and token frequency distributions with written data, and evaluating
    parse accuracy by length of input string. We find that parser performance tends
    to deteriorate with increasing length of string, more so for spoken than for written
    texts. We train an alternative parsing model with added speech data and demonstrate
    improvements in accuracy on speech-units, with no deterioration in performance
    on written text.

  abstract: Parsing speech requires a richer representation than 1-best or n-best
    hypotheses, e.g. lattices. Moreover, previous work shows that part-of-speech (POS)
    tags are a valuable resource for parsing. In this paper, we therefore explore
    a joint modeling approach of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and POS tagging
    to enrich ASR word lattices. To that end, we manipulate the ASR process from the
    pronouncing dictionary onward to use word-POS pairs instead of words. We evaluate
    ASR, POS tagging and dependency parsing (DP) performance demonstrating a successful
    lattice-based integration of ASR and POS tagging.

  abstract: Most state-of-the-art information extraction approaches rely on token-level
    labels to find the areas of interest in text. Unfortunately, these labels are
    time-consuming and costly to create, and consequently, not available for many
    real-life IE tasks. To make matters worse, token-level labels are usually not
    the desired output, but just an intermediary step. End-to-end (E2E) models, which
    take raw text as input and produce the desired output directly, need not depend
    on token-level labels. We propose an E2E model based on pointer networks, which
    can be trained directly on pairs of raw input and output text. We evaluate our
    model on the ATIS data set, MIT restaurant corpus and the MIT movie corpus and
    compare to neural baselines that do use token-level labels. We achieve competitive
    results, within a few percentage points of the baselines, showing the feasibility
    of E2E information extraction without the need for token-level labels. This opens
    up new possibilities, as for many tasks currently addressed by human extractors,
    raw input and output data are available, but not token-level labels.

  abstract: Vast amounts of speech data collected for language documentation and research
    remain untranscribed and unsearchable, but often a small amount of speech may
    have text translations available. We present a method for partially labeling additional
    speech with translations in this scenario. We modify an unsupervised speech-to-translation
    alignment model and obtain prototype speech segments that match the translation
    words, which are in turn used to discover terms in the unlabelled data. We evaluate
    our method on a Spanish-English speech translation corpus and on two corpora of
    endangered languages, Arapaho and Ainu, demonstrating its appropriateness and
    applicability in an actual very-low-resource scenario.

  abstract: This paper describes speech translation from Amharic-to-English, particularly
    Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with post-editing feature and Amharic-English
    Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). ASR experiment is conducted using morpheme
    language model (LM) and phoneme acoustic model(AM). Likewise,SMT conducted using
    word and morpheme as unit. Morpheme based translation shows a 6.29 BLEU score
    at a 76.4% of recognition accuracy while word based translation shows a 12.83
    BLEU score using 77.4% word recognition accuracy. Further, after post-edit on
    Amharic ASR using corpus based n-gram, the word recognition accuracy increased
    by 1.42%. Since post-edit approach reduces error propagation, the word based translation
    accuracy improved by 0.25 (1.95%) BLEU score. We are now working towards further
    improving propagated errors through different algorithms at each unit of speech
    translation cascading component.

  abstract: We consider the automatic scoring of a task for which both the content
    of the response as well its spoken fluency are important. We combine features
    from a text-only content scoring system originally designed for written responses
    with several categories of acoustic features. Although adding any single category
    of acoustic features to the text-only system on its own does not significantly
    improve performance, adding all acoustic features together does yield a small
    but significant improvement. These results are consistent for responses to open-ended
    questions and to questions focused on some given source material.

  abstract: Adding manually annotated prosodic information, specifically pitch accents
    and phrasing, to the typical text-based feature set for coreference resolution
    has previously been shown to have a positive effect on German data. Practical
    applications on spoken language, however, would rely on automatically predicted
    prosodic information. In this paper we predict pitch accents (and phrase boundaries)
    using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model from acoustic features extracted
    from the speech signal. After an assessment of the quality of these automatic
    prosodic annotations, we show that they also significantly improve coreference
    resolution.

  abstract: 'We describe the design, the setup, and the evaluation results of the
    DiscoMT 2017 shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction. The task asked participants
    to predict a target-language pronoun given a source-language pronoun in the context
    of a sentence. We further provided a lemmatized target-language human-authored
    translation of the source sentence, and automatic word alignments between the
    source sentence words and the target-language lemmata. The aim of the task was
    to predict, for each target-language pronoun placeholder, the word that should
    replace it from a small, closed set of classes, using any type of information
    that can be extracted from the entire document. We offered four subtasks, each
    for a different language pair and translation direction: English-to-French, English-to-German,
    German-to-English, and Spanish-to-English. Five teams participated in the shared
    task, making submissions for all language pairs. The evaluation results show that
    most participating teams outperformed two strong n-gram-based language model-based
    baseline systems by a sizable margin.'

  abstract: In this paper, we define and assess a reference-based metric to evaluate
    the accuracy of pronoun translation (APT). The metric automatically aligns a candidate
    and a reference translation using GIZA++ augmented with specific heuristics, and
    then counts the number of identical or different pronouns, with provision for
    legitimate variations and omitted pronouns. All counts are then combined into
    one score. The metric is applied to the results of seven systems (including the
    baseline) that participated in the DiscoMT 2015 shared task on pronoun translation
    from English to French. The APT metric reaches around 0.993-0.999 Pearson correlation
    with human judges (depending on the parameters of APT), while other automatic
    metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, or those specific to pronouns used at DiscoMT 2015
    reach only 0.972-0.986 Pearson correlation.

  abstract: Although coherence is an important aspect of any text generation system,
    it has received little attention in the context of machine translation (MT) so
    far. We hypothesize that the quality of document-level translation can be improved
    if MT models take into account the semantic relations among sentences during translation.
    We integrate the graph-based coherence model proposed by Mesgar and Strube, (2016)
    with Docent (Hardmeier et al., 2012, Hardmeier, 2014) a document-level machine
    translation system. The application of this graph-based coherence modeling approach
    is novel in the context of machine translation. We evaluate the coherence model
    and its effects on the quality of the machine translation. The result of our experiments
    shows that our coherence model slightly improves the quality of translation in
    terms of the average Meteor score.

  abstract: We present work on handling XML markup in Statistical Machine Translation
    (SMT). The methods we propose can be used to effectively preserve markup (for
    instance inline formatting or structure) and to place markup correctly in a machine-translated
    segment. We evaluate our approaches with parallel data that naturally contains
    markup or where markup was inserted to create synthetic examples. In our experiments,
    hybrid reinsertion has proven the most accurate method to handle markup, while
    alignment masking and alignment reinsertion should be regarded as viable alternatives.
    We provide implementations of all the methods described and they are freely available
    as an open-source framework.

  abstract: We describe the Uppsala system for the 2017 DiscoMT shared task on cross-lingual
    pronoun prediction. The system is based on a lower layer of BiLSTMs reading the
    source and target sentences respectively. Classification is based on the BiLSTM
    representation of the source and target positions for the pronouns. In addition
    we enrich our system with dependency representations from an external parser and
    character representations of the source sentence. We show that these additions
    perform well for German and Spanish as source languages. Our system is competitive
    and is in first or second place for all language pairs.

  abstract: In this paper we present our systems for the DiscoMT 2017 cross-lingual
    pronoun prediction shared task. For all four language pairs, we trained a standard
    attention-based neural machine translation system as well as three variants that
    incorporate information from the preceding source sentence. We show that our systems,
    which are not specifically designed for pronoun prediction and may be used to
    generate complete sentence translations, generally achieve competitive results
    on this task.

  abstract: Although parallel coreference corpora can to a high degree support the
    development of SMT systems, there are no large-scale parallel datasets available
    due to the complexity of the annotation task and the variability in annotation
    schemes. In this study, we exploit an annotation projection method to combine
    the output of two coreference resolution systems for two different source languages
    (English, German) in order to create an annotated corpus for a third language
    (Russian). We show that our technique is superior to projecting annotations from
    a single source language, and we provide an in-depth analysis of the projected
    annotations in order to assess the perspectives of our approach.

  abstract: "In this paper, we analyse alignment discrepancies for discourse structures\
    \ in English-German parallel data \u2013 sentence pairs, in which discourse structures\
    \ in target or source texts have no alignment in the corresponding parallel sentences.\
    \ The discourse-related structures are designed in form of linguistic patterns\
    \ based on the information delivered by automatic part-of-speech and dependency\
    \ annotation. In addition to alignment errors (existing structures left unaligned),\
    \ these alignment discrepancies can be caused by language contrasts or through\
    \ the phenomena of explicitation and implicitation in the translation process.\
    \ We propose a new approach including new type of resources for corpus-based language\
    \ contrast analysis and apply it to study and classify the contrasts found in\
    \ our English-German parallel corpus. As unaligned discourse structures may also\
    \ result in the loss of discourse information in the MT training data, we hope\

  abstract: We investigate the use of extended context in attention-based neural machine
    translation. We base our experiments on translated movie subtitles and discuss
    the effect of increasing the segments beyond single translation units. We study
    the use of extended source language context as well as bilingual context extensions.
    The models learn to distinguish between information from different segments and
    are surprisingly robust with respect to translation quality. In this pilot study,
    we observe interesting cross-sentential attention patterns that improve textual
    coherence in translation at least in some selected cases.

  abstract: Implicit discourse connectives and relations are distributed more widely
    in Chinese texts, when translating into English, such connectives are usually
    translated explicitly. Towards Chinese-English MT, in this paper we describe cross-lingual
    annotation and alignment of dis-course connectives in a parallel corpus, describing
    related surveys and findings. We then conduct some evaluation experiments to testify
    the translation of implicit connectives and whether representing implicit connectives
    explicitly in source language can improve the final translation performance significantly.
    Preliminary results show it has little improvement by just inserting explicit
    connectives for implicit relations.

  abstract: Currently under review for EMNLP 2017 The phrase-based Statistical Machine
    Translation (SMT) approach deals with sentences in isolation, making it difficult
    to consider discourse context in translation. This poses a challenge for ambiguous
    words that need discourse knowledge to be correctly translated. We propose a method
    that benefits from the semantic similarity in lexical chains to improve SMT output
    by integrating it in a document-level decoder. We focus on word embeddings to
    deal with the lexical chains, contrary to the traditional approach that uses lexical
    resources. Experimental results on German-to-English show that our method produces
    correct translations in up to 88% of the changes, improving the translation in
    36%-48% of them over the baseline.

  abstract: "As the quality of Machine Translation (MT) improves, research on improving\
    \ discourse in automatic translations becomes more viable. This has resulted in\
    \ an increase in the amount of work on discourse in MT. However many of the existing\
    \ models and metrics have yet to integrate these insights. Part of this is due\
    \ to the evaluation methodology, based as it is largely on matching to a single\
    \ reference. At a time when MT is increasingly being used in a pipeline for other\
    \ tasks, the semantic element of the translation process needs to be properly\
    \ integrated into the task. Moreover, in order to take MT to another level, it\
    \ will need to judge output not based on a single reference translation, but based\
    \ on notions of fluency and of adequacy \u2013 ideally with reference to the source\
    \ text."

    \ is still by and large a manual process, and there have been little efforts towards\
    \ automating it. In this paper we explore automated methods to transform text\

    \ model with pointers to enable copy action. To tackle limited amount of parallel\
    \ data, we pre-train embeddings of words by leveraging external dictionaries mapping\
    \ Shakespearean words to modern English words as well as additional text. Our\
    \ methods are able to get a BLEU score of 31+, an improvement of \u2248 6 points\

  abstract: Detecting and analyzing stylistic variation in language is relevant to
    diverse Natural Language Processing applications. In this work, we investigate
    whether salient dimensions of style variations are embedded in standard distributional
    vector spaces of word meaning. We hypothesizes that distances between embeddings
    of lexical paraphrases can help isolate style from meaning variations and help
    identify latent style dimensions. We conduct a qualitative analysis of latent
    style dimensions, and show the effectiveness of identified style subspaces on
    a lexical formality prediction task.

  abstract: Many of the creative and figurative elements that make language exciting
    are lost in translation in current natural language generation engines. In this
    paper, we explore a method to harvest templates from positive and negative reviews
    in the restaurant domain, with the goal of vastly expanding the types of stylistic
    variation available to the natural language generator. We learn hyperbolic adjective
    patterns that are representative of the strongly-valenced expressive language
    commonly used in either positive or negative reviews. We then identify and delexicalize
    entities, and use heuristics to extract generation templates from review sentences.
    We evaluate the learned templates against more traditional review templates, using
    subjective measures of convincingness, interestingness, and naturalness. Our results
    show that the learned templates score highly on these measures. Finally, we analyze
    the linguistic categories that characterize the learned positive and negative
    templates. We plan to use the learned templates to improve the conversational
    style of dialogue systems in the restaurant domain.

  abstract: 'The problem of detecting scientific fraud using machine learning was
    recently introduced, with initial, positive results from a model taking into account
    various general indicators. The results seem to suggest that writing style is
    predictive of scientific fraud. We revisit these initial experiments, and show
    that the leave-one-out testing procedure they used likely leads to a slight over-estimate
    of the predictability, but also that simple models can outperform their proposed
    model by some margin. We go on to explore more abstract linguistic features, such
    as linguistic complexity and discourse structure, only to obtain negative results.
    Upon analyzing our models, we do see some interesting patterns, though: Scientific
    fraud, for examples, contains less comparison, as well as different types of hedging
    and ways of presenting logical reasoning.'

  abstract: 'Metaphor is one of the most studied and widespread figures of speech
    and an essential element of individual style. In this paper we look at metaphor
    identification in Adjective-Noun pairs. We show that using a single neural network
    combined with pre-trained vector embeddings can outperform the state of the art
    in terms of accuracy. In specific, the approach presented in this paper is based
    on two ideas: a) transfer learning via using pre-trained vectors representing
    adjective noun pairs, and b) a neural network as a model of composition that predicts
    a metaphoricity score as output. We present several different architectures for
    our system and evaluate their performances. Variations on dataset size and on
    the kinds of embeddings are also investigated. We show considerable improvement
    over the previous approaches both in terms of accuracy and w.r.t the size of annotated
    training data.'

    on a very homogeneous dataset of scientific publications. In order to investigate
    the effect of domain biases, we obscure words below a certain frequency threshold,
    retaining only their POS-tags. This procedure improves test performance due to
    better generalization on unseen data. Using our method, we are able to predict
    the authors of scientific publications in the same discipline at levels well above
    chance.

  abstract: 'Sociolinguistic research suggests that speakers modulate their language
    style in response to their audience. Similar effects have recently been claimed
    to occur in the informal written context of Twitter, with users choosing less
    region-specific and non-standard vocabulary when addressing larger audiences.
    However, these studies have not carefully controlled for the possible confound
    of topic: that is, tweets addressed to a broad audience might also tend towards
    topics that engender a more formal style. In addition, it is not clear to what
    extent previous results generalize to different samples of users. Using mixed-effects
    models, we show that audience and topic have independent effects on the rate of
    distinctively Scottish usage in two demographically distinct Twitter user samples.
    However, not all effects are consistent between the two groups, underscoring the
    importance of replicating studies on distinct user samples before drawing strong
    conclusions from social media data.'

  abstract: The differences in the frequencies of some parts of speech (POS), particularly
    function words, and lexical diversity in male and female speech have been pointed
    out in a number of papers. The classifiers using exclusively context-independent
    parameters have proved to be highly effective. However, there are still issues
    that have to be addressed as a lot of studies are performed for English and the
    genre and topic of texts is sometimes neglected. The aim of this paper is to investigate
    the association between context-independent parameters of Russian written texts
    and the gender of their authors and to design predictive re-gression models. A
    number of correlations were found. The obtained data is in good agreement with
    the results obtained for other languages. The model based on 5 parameters with
    the highest correlation coefficients was designed.

  abstract: While there is wide acknowledgement in NLP of the utility of document
    characterization by genre, it is quite difficult to determine a definitive set
    of features or even a comprehensive list of genres. This paper addresses both
    issues. First, with prototype semantics, we develop a hierarchical taxonomy of
    discourse functions. We implement the taxonomy by developing a new text genre
    corpus of contemporary German to perform a text based comparative register analysis.
    Second, we extract a host of style features, both deep and shallow, aiming beyond
    linguistically motivated features at situational correlates in texts. The feature
    sets are used for supervised text genre classification, on which our models achieve
    high accuracy. The combination of the corpus typology and feature sets allows
    us to characterize types of communicative purpose in a comparative setup, by qualitative
    interpretation of style feature loadings of a regularized discriminant analysis.
    Finally, to determine the dependence of genre on topics (which are arguably the
    distinguishing factor of sub-genre), we compare and combine our style models with
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation features across different corpus settings with unstable
    topics.

  abstract: "Conversation is a critical component of storytelling, where key information\
    \ is often revealed by what/how a character says it. We focus on the issue of\
    \ character voice and build stylistic models with linguistic features related\
    \ to natural language generation decisions. Using a dialogue corpus of the television\
    \ series, The Big Bang Theory, we apply content analysis to extract relevant linguistic\
    \ features to build character-based stylistic models, and we test the model-fit\
    \ through an user perceptual experiment with Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. The\
    \ results are encouraging in that human subjects tend to perceive the generated\
    \ utterances as being more similar to the character they are modeled on, than\
    \ to another random character."

  abstract: Most work on neural natural language generation (NNLG) focus on controlling
    the content of the generated text. We experiment with controling several stylistic
    aspects of the generated text, in addition to its content. The method is based
    on conditioned RNN language model, where the desired content as well as the stylistic
    parameters serve as conditioning contexts. We demonstrate the approach on the
    movie reviews domain and show that it is successful in generating coherent sentences
    corresponding to the required linguistic style and content.

  abstract: 'The concept of style is much debated in theoretical as well as empirical
    terms. From an empirical perspective, the key question is how to operationalize
    style and thus make it accessible for annotation and quantification. In authorship
    attribution, many different approaches have successfully resolved this issue at
    the cost of linguistic interpretability: The resulting algorithms may be able
    to distinguish one language variety from the other, but do not give us much information
    on their distinctive linguistic properties. We approach the issue of interpreting
    stylistic features by extracting linear and syntactic n-grams that are distinctive
    for a language variety. We present a study that exemplifies this process by a
    comparison of the German academic languages of linguistics and literary studies.
    Overall, our findings show that distinctive n-grams can be related to linguistic
    categories. The results suggest that the style of German literary studies is characterized
    by nominal structures and the style of linguistics by verbal ones.'

  abstract: 'Recent applications of neural language models have led to an increased
    interest in the automatic generation of natural language. However impressive,
    the evaluation of neurally generated text has so far remained rather informal
    and anecdotal. Here, we present an attempt at the systematic assessment of one
    aspect of the quality of neurally generated text. We focus on a specific aspect
    of neural language generation: its ability to reproduce authorial writing styles.
    Using established models for authorship attribution, we empirically assess the
    stylistic qualities of neurally generated text. In comparison to conventional
    language models, neural models generate fuzzier text, that is relatively harder
    to attribute correctly. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that neurally generated
    text offers more valuable perspectives for the augmentation of training data.'

  abstract: For medical students, virtual patient dialogue systems can provide useful
    training opportunities without the cost of employing actors to portray standardized
    patients. This work utilizes word- and character-based convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) for question identification in a virtual patient dialogue system, outperforming
    a strong word- and character-based logistic regression baseline. While the CNNs
    perform well given sufficient training data, the best system performance is ultimately
    achieved by combining CNNs with a hand-crafted pattern matching system that is
    robust to label sparsity, providing a 10% boost in system accuracy and an error
    reduction of 47% as compared to the pattern-matching system alone.

  abstract: We investigate the utility of different auxiliary objectives and training
    strategies within a neural sequence labeling approach to error detection in learner
    writing. Auxiliary costs provide the model with additional linguistic information,
    allowing it to learn general-purpose compositional features that can then be exploited
    for other objectives. Our experiments show that a joint learning approach trained
    with parallel labels on in-domain data improves performance over the previous
    best error detection system. While the resulting model has the same number of
    parameters, the additional objectives allow it to be optimised more efficiently
    and achieve better performance.

  abstract: 'Native Language Identification (NLI) is the task of automatically identifying
    the native language (L1) of an individual based on their language production in
    a learned language. It is typically framed as a classification task where the
    set of L1s is known a priori. Two previous shared tasks on NLI have been organized
    where the aim was to identify the L1 of learners of English based on essays (2013)
    and spoken responses (2016) they provided during a standardized assessment of
    academic English proficiency. The 2017 shared task combines the inputs from the
    two prior tasks for the first time. There are three tracks: NLI on the essay only,
    NLI on the spoken response only (based on a transcription of the response and
    i-vector acoustic features), and NLI using both responses. We believe this makes
    for a more interesting shared task while building on the methods and results from
    the previous two shared tasks. In this paper, we report the results of the shared
    task. A total of 19 teams competed across the three different sub-tasks. The fusion
    track showed that combining the written and spoken responses provides a large
    boost in prediction accuracy. Multiple classifier systems (e.g. ensembles and
    meta-classifiers) were the most effective in all tasks, with most based on traditional
    classifiers (e.g. SVMs) with lexical/syntactic features.'

  abstract: 'This study provides a detailed analysis of evaluation of English pronoun
    reference questions which are created automatically by machine. Pronoun reference
    questions are multiple choice questions that ask test takers to choose an antecedent
    of a target pronoun in a reading passage from four options. The evaluation was
    performed from two perspectives: the perspective of English teachers and that
    of English learners. Item analysis suggests that machine-generated questions achieve
    comparable quality with human-made questions. Correlation analysis revealed a
    strong correlation between the scores of machine-generated questions and that

    \ (college) institutions. Educators teaching postsecondary courses requiring writing\
    \ could benefit from a better understanding of writing achievement and its role\

    s potential to support educational analytics \u2013 i.e., relationships between\

  abstract: "Characterizing the content of a technical document in terms of its learning\
    \ utility can be useful for applications related to education, such as generating\
    \ reading lists from large collections of documents. We refer to this learning\
    \ utility as the \u201Cpedagogical value\u201D of the document to the learner.\
    \ While pedagogical value is an important concept that has been studied extensively\
    \ within the education domain, there has been little work exploring it from a\
    \ computational, i.e., natural language processing (NLP), perspective. To allow\
    \ a computational exploration of this concept, we introduce the notion of \u201C\
    pedagogical roles\u201D of documents (e.g., Tutorial and Survey) as an intermediary\
    \ component for the study of pedagogical value. Given the lack of available corpora\
    \ for our exploration, we create the first annotated corpus of pedagogical roles\
    \ and use it to test baseline techniques for automatic prediction of such roles."

  abstract: Given the lack of large user-evaluated corpora in disability-related NLP
    research (e.g. text simplification or readability assessment for people with cognitive
    disabilities), the question of choosing suitable training data for NLP models
    is not straightforward. The use of large generic corpora may be problematic because
    such data may not reflect the needs of the target population. The use of the available
    user-evaluated corpora may be problematic because these datasets are not large
    enough to be used as training data. In this paper we explore a third approach,
    in which a large generic corpus is combined with a smaller population-specific
    corpus to train a classifier which is evaluated using two sets of unseen user-evaluated
    data. One of these sets, the ASD Comprehension corpus, is developed for the purposes
    of this study and made freely available. We explore the effects of the size and
    type of the training data used on the performance of the classifiers, and the
    effects of the type of the unseen test datasets on the classification performance.

  abstract: Flashcard systems are effective tools for learning words but have their
    limitations in teaching word usage. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel
    flashcard system that shows a new example sentence on each repetition. This extension
    requires high-quality example sentences, automatically extracted from a huge corpus.
    To do this, we use a Determinantal Point Process which scales well to large data
    and allows to naturally represent sentence similarity and quality as features.
    Our human evaluation experiment on Japanese language indicates that the proposed
    method successfully extracted high-quality example sentences.

  abstract: This paper reports the first study on automatic generation of distractors
    for fill-in-the-blank items for learning Chinese vocabulary. We investigate the
    quality of distractors generated by a number of criteria, including part-of-speech,
    difficulty level, spelling, word co-occurrence and semantic similarity. Evaluations
    show that a semantic similarity measure, based on the word2vec model, yields distractors
    that are significantly more plausible than those generated by baseline methods.

    \ accuracy. The inputs to neural essay scoring models \u2013 ngrams and embeddings\
    \ \u2013 are arguably well-suited to evaluate content in short answer scoring\
    \ tasks. We investigate how several basic neural approaches similar to those used\
    \ for automated essay scoring perform on short answer scoring. We show that neural\
    \ architectures can outperform a strong non-neural baseline, but performance and\
    \ optimal parameter settings vary across the more diverse types of prompts typical\
    \ of short answer scoring."

  abstract: 'This paper is concerned with the task of automatically assessing the
    written proficiency level of non-native (L2) learners of English. Drawing on previous
    research on automated L2 writing assessment following the Common European Framework
    of Reference for Languages (CEFR), we investigate the possibilities and difficulties
    of deriving the CEFR level from short answers to open-ended questions, which has
    not yet been subjected to numerous studies up to date. The object of our study
    is twofold: to examine the intricacy involved with both human and automated CEFR-based
    grading of short answers. On the one hand, we describe the compilation of a learner
    corpus of short answers graded with CEFR levels by three certified Cambridge examiners.
    We mainly observe that, although the shortness of the answers is reported as undermining
    a clear-cut evaluation, the length of the answer does not necessarily correlate
    with inter-examiner disagreement. On the other hand, we explore the development
    of a soft-voting system for the automated CEFR-based grading of short answers
    and draw tentative conclusions about its use in a computer-assisted testing (CAT)
    setting.'

  abstract: Automated methods for essay scoring have made great progress in recent
    years, achieving accuracies very close to human annotators. However, a known weakness
    of such automated scorers is not taking into account the semantic relevance of
    the submitted text. While there is existing work on detecting answer relevance
    given a textual prompt, very little previous research has been done to incorporate
    visual writing prompts. We propose a neural architecture and several extensions
    for detecting off-topic responses to visual prompts and evaluate it on a dataset
    of texts written by language learners.

  abstract: We describe a machine learning approach for the 2017 shared task on Native
    Language Identification (NLI). The proposed approach combines several kernels
    using multiple kernel learning. While most of our kernels are based on character
    p-grams (also known as n-grams) extracted from essays or speech transcripts, we
    also use a kernel based on i-vectors, a low-dimensional representation of audio
    recordings, provided by the shared task organizers. For the learning stage, we
    choose Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) over Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR),
    because the former classifier obtains better results than the latter one on the
    development set. In our previous work, we have used a similar machine learning
    approach to achieve state-of-the-art NLI results. The goal of this paper is to
    demonstrate that our shallow and simple approach based on string kernels (with
    minor improvements) can pass the test of time and reach state-of-the-art performance
    in the 2017 NLI shared task, despite the recent advances in natural language processing.
    We participated in all three tracks, in which the competitors were allowed to
    use only the essays (essay track), only the speech transcripts (speech track),
    or both (fusion track). Using only the data provided by the organizers for training
    our models, we have reached a macro F1 score of 86.95% in the closed essay track,
    a macro F1 score of 87.55% in the closed speech track, and a macro F1 score of
    93.19% in the closed fusion track. With these scores, our team (UnibucKernel)
    ranked in the first group of teams in all three tracks, while attaining the best
    scores in the speech and the fusion tracks.

    set for written essays had a macro F1 of 0.8264 and was based on word uni, bi

    mixed representations for this task. For embedding based feature representations,
    we employed both word and document embeddings. We had a relatively poor performance
    with all embedding representations compared to n-grams, which could be because
    of the fact that embeddings capture semantic similarities whereas L1 differences
    are more stylistic in nature.'

  abstract: This paper describes our results at the NLI shared task 2017. We participated
    in essays, speech, and fusion task that uses text, speech, and i-vectors for the
    task of identifying the native language of the given input. In the essay track,
    a linear SVM system using word bigrams and character 7-grams performed the best.
    In the speech track, an LDA classifier based only on i-vectors performed better
    than a combination system using text features from speech transcriptions and i-vectors.
    In the fusion task, we experimented with systems that used combination of i-vectors
    with higher order n-grams features, combination of i-vectors with word unigrams,
    a mean probability ensemble, and a stacked ensemble system. Our finding is that
    word unigrams in combination with i-vectors achieve higher score than systems
    trained with larger number of n-gram features. Our best-performing systems achieved
    F1-scores of 87.16%, 83.33% and 91.75% on the essay track, the speech track and
    the fusion track respectively. -gram features. Our best-performing systems achieved
    F1-scores of 87.16%, 83.33% and 91.75% on the essay track, the speech track and
    the fusion track respectively.

  abstract: Learners need to find suitable documents to read and prioritize them in
    an appropriate order. We present a method of automatically generating reading
    lists, selecting documents based on their pedagogical value to the learner and
    ordering them using the structure of concepts in the domain. Resulting reading
    lists related to computational linguistics were evaluated by advanced learners
    and judged to be near the quality of those generated by domain experts. We provide
    an open-source implementation of our method to enable future work on reading list
    generation.

  abstract: 'Eye tracking studies from the past few decades have shaped the way we
    think of word complexity and cognitive load: words that are long, rare and ambiguous
    are more difficult to read. However, online processing techniques have been scarcely
    applied to investigating the reading difficulties of people with autism and what
    vocabulary is challenging for them. We present parallel gaze data obtained from
    adult readers with autism and a control group of neurotypical readers and show
    that the former required higher cognitive effort to comprehend the texts as evidenced
    by three gaze-based measures. We divide all words into four classes based on their
    viewing times for both groups and investigate the relationship between longer
    viewing times and word length, word frequency, and four cognitively-based measures
    (word concreteness, familiarity, age of acquisition and imagability).'

  abstract: 'We present a very simple model for text quality assessment based on a
    deep convolutional neural network, where the only supervision required is one
    corpus of user-generated text of varying quality, and one contrasting text corpus
    of consistently high quality. Our model is able to provide local quality assessments
    in different parts of a text, which allows visual feedback about where potentially
    problematic parts of the text are located, as well as a way to evaluate which
    textual features are captured by our model. We evaluate our method on two corpora:
    a large corpus of manually graded student essays and a longitudinal corpus of
    language learner written production, and find that the text quality metric learned
    by our model is a fairly strong predictor of both essay grade and learner proficiency
    level.'

  abstract: Shortage of available training data is holding back progress in the area
    of automated error detection. This paper investigates two alternative methods
    for artificially generating writing errors, in order to create additional resources.
    We propose treating error generation as a machine translation task, where grammatically
    correct text is translated to contain errors. In addition, we explore a system
    for extracting textual patterns from an annotated corpus, which can then be used
    to insert errors into grammatically correct sentences. Our experiments show that
    the inclusion of artificially generated errors significantly improves error detection
    accuracy on both FCE and CoNLL 2014 datasets.

  abstract: 'The paper presents first results of an ongoing project on text simplification
    focusing on linguistic metaphors. Based on an analysis of a parallel corpus of
    news text professionally simplified for different grade levels, we identify six
    types of simplification choices falling into two broad categories: preserving
    metaphors or dropping them. An annotation study on almost 300 source sentences
    with metaphors (grade level 12) and their simplified counterparts (grade 4) is
    conducted. The results show that most metaphors are preserved and when they are
    dropped, the semantic content tends to be preserved rather than dropped, however,
    it is reworded without metaphorical language. In general, some of the expected
    tendencies in complexity reduction, measured with psycholinguistic variables linked
    to metaphor comprehension, are observed, suggesting good prospect for machine
    learning-based metaphor simplification.'

  abstract: Knowledge of the association between assessment questions and the skills
    required to solve them is necessary for analysis of student learning. This association,
    often represented as a Q-matrix, is either hand-labeled by domain experts or learned
    as latent variables given a large student response data set. As a means of automating
    the match to formal standards, this paper uses neural text classification methods,
    leveraging the language in the standards documents to identify online text for
    a proxy training task. Experiments involve identifying the topic and crosscutting
    concepts of middle school science questions leveraging multi-task training. Results
    show that it is possible to automatically build a Q-matrix without student response
    data and using a modest number of hand-labeled questions.

  abstract: We build a grammatical error correction (GEC) system primarily based on
    the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) approach, using task-specific
    features and tuning, and further enhance it with the modeling power of neural
    network joint models. The SMT-based system is weak in generalizing beyond patterns
    seen during training and lacks granularity below the word level. To address this
    issue, we incorporate a character-level SMT component targeting the misspelled
    words that the original SMT-based system fails to correct. Our final system achieves
    53.14% F 0.5 score on the benchmark CoNLL-2014 test set, an improvement of 3.62%
    F 0.5 over the best previous published score.

  abstract: "In Foreign Language Teaching and Learning (FLTL), questions are systematically\
    \ used to assess the learner\u2019s understanding of a text. Computational linguistic\
    \ approaches have been developed to generate such questions automatically given\
    \ a text (e.g., Heilman, 2011). In this paper, we want to broaden the perspective\
    \ on the different functions questions can play in FLTL and discuss how automatic\
    \ question generation can support the different uses. Complementing the focus\
    \ on meaning and comprehension, we want to highlight the fact that questions can\
    \ also be used to make learners notice form aspects of the linguistic system and\
    \ their interpretation. Automatically generating questions that target linguistic\
    \ forms and grammatical categories in a text in essence supports incidental focus-on-form\
    \ (Loewen, 2005) in a meaning-focused reading task. We discuss two types of questions\
    \ serving this purpose, how they can be generated automatically; and we report\
    \ on a crowd-sourcing evaluation comparing automatically generated to manually\
    \ written questions targeting particle verbs, a challenging linguistic form for\

  abstract: Automatic essay scoring is nowadays successfully used even in high-stakes
    tests, but this is mainly limited to holistic scoring of learner essays. We present
    a new dataset of essays written by highly proficient German native speakers that
    is scored using a fine-grained rubric with the goal to provide detailed feedback.
    Our experiments with two state-of-the-art scoring systems (a neural and a SVM-based
    one) show a large drop in performance compared to existing datasets. This demonstrates
    the need for such datasets that allow to guide research on more elaborate essay
    scoring methods.

  abstract: We describe the submissions entered by the National Research Council Canada
    in the NLI-2017 evaluation. We mainly explored the use of voting, and various
    ways to optimize the choice and number of voting systems. We also explored the
    use of features that rely on no linguistic preprocessing. Long ngrams of characters
    obtained from raw text turned out to yield the best performance on all textual
    input (written essays and speech transcripts). Voting ensembles turned out to
    produce small performance gains, with little difference between the various optimization
    strategies we tried. Our top systems achieved accuracies of 87% on the essay track,
    84% on the speech track, and close to 92% by combining essays, speech and i-vectors
    in the fusion track.

  abstract: We present the CIC-FBK system, which took part in the Native Language
    Identification (NLI) Shared Task 2017. Our approach combines features commonly
    used in previous NLI research, i.e., word n-grams, lemma n-grams, part-of-speech
    n-grams, and function words, with recently introduced character n-grams from misspelled
    words, and features that are novel in this task, such as typed character n-grams,
    and syntactic n-grams of words and of syntactic relation tags. We use log-entropy
    weighting scheme and perform classification using the Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) algorithm. Our system achieved 0.8808 macro-averaged F1-score and shared
    the 1st rank in the NLI Shared Task 2017 scoring.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore the performance of a linear SVM trained on language
    independent character features for the NLI Shared Task 2017. Our basic system
    (GRONINGEN) achieves the best performance (87.56 F1-score) on the evaluation set
    using only 1-9 character n-grams as features. We compare this against several
    ensemble and meta-classifiers in order to examine how the linear system fares
    when combined with other, especially non-linear classifiers. Special emphasis
    is placed on the topic bias that exists by virtue of the assessment essay prompt
    distribution.

  abstract: This paper reports our contribution (team WLZ) to the NLI Shared Task
    2017 (essay track). We first extract lexical and syntactic features from the essays,
    perform feature weighting and selection, and train linear support vector machine
    (SVM) classifiers each on an individual feature type. The output of base classifiers,
    as probabilities for each class, are then fed into a multilayer perceptron to
    predict the native language of the author. We also report the performance of each
    feature type, as well as the best features of a type. Our system achieves an accuracy
    of 86.55%, which is among the best performing systems of this shared task.

  abstract: In this paper, we discuss the results of the IUCL system in the NLI Shared
    Task 2017. For our system, we explore a variety of phonetic algorithms to generate
    features for Native Language Identification. These features are contrasted with
    one of the most successful type of features in NLI, character n-grams. We find
    that although phonetic features do not perform as well as character n-grams alone,
    they do increase overall F1 score when used together with character n-grams.

  abstract: This paper proposes a deep-learning based native-language identification
    (NLI) using a latent semantic analysis (LSA) as a participant (ETRI-SLP) of the
    NLI Shared Task 2017 where the NLI Shared Task 2017 aims to detect the native
    language of an essay or speech response of a standardized assessment of English
    proficiency for academic purposes. To this end, we use the six unit forms of a
    text data such as character 4/5/6-grams and word 1/2/3-grams. For each unit form
    of text data, we convert it into a count-based vector, extract a 2000-rank LSA
    feature, and perform a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based dimension reduction.
    From the count-based vector or the LSA-LDA feature, we also obtain the output
    prediction values of a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier, the output
    prediction values of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier, and the bottleneck
    values of a DNN based classifier. In order to incorporate the various kinds of
    text-based features and a speech-based i-vector feature, we design two DNN based
    ensemble classifiers for late fusion and early fusion, respectively. From the
    NLI experiments, the F1 (macro) scores are obtained as 0.8601, 0.8664, and 0.9220
    for the essay track, the speech track, and the fusion track, respectively. The
    proposed method has comparable performance to the top-ranked teams for the speech
    and fusion tracks, although it has slightly lower performance for the essay track.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the approaches we explored for the 2017 Native
    Language Identification shared task. We focused on simple word and sub-word units
    avoiding heavy use of hand-crafted features. Following recent trends, we explored
    linear and neural networks models to attempt to compensate for the lack of rich
    feature use. Initial efforts yielded f1-scores of 82.39% and 83.77% in the development
    and test sets of the fusion track, and were officially submitted to the task as
    team L2F. After the task was closed, we carried on further experiments and relied
    on a late fusion strategy for combining our simple proposed approaches with modifications
    of the baselines provided by the task. As expected, the i-vectors based sub-system
    dominates the performance of the system combinations, and results in the major
    contributor to our achieved scores. Our best combined system achieves 90.1% and
    90.2% f1-score in the development and test sets of the fusion track, respectively.

    language identification and discuss the results we submitted as participants to
    the essay track of NLI Shared Task 2017. We introduce for the first time a 2-stacked
    sentence-document architecture for native language identification that is able
    to exploit both local sentence information and a wide set of general-purpose features
    qualifying the lexical and grammatical structure of the whole document. When evaluated
    on the official test set, our sentence-document stacked architecture obtained
    the best result among all the participants of the essay track with an F1 score
    of 0.8818.

  abstract: We show that text readability prediction improves significantly from hard
    parameter sharing with models predicting first pass duration, total fixation duration
    and regression duration. Specifically, we induce multi-task Multilayer Perceptrons
    and Logistic Regression models over sentence representations that capture various
    aggregate statistics, from two different text readability corpora for English,
    as well as the Dundee eye-tracking corpus. Our approach leads to significant improvements
    over Single task learning and over previous systems. In addition, our improvements
    are consistent across train sample sizes, making our approach especially applicable
    to small datasets.

  abstract: "NLP applications for learners often rely on annotated learner corpora.\
    \ Thereby, it is important that the annotations are both meaningful for the task,\
    \ and consistent and reliable. We present a new longitudinal L1 learner corpus\
    \ for German (handwritten texts collected in grade 2\u20134), which is transcribed\
    \ and annotated with a target hypothesis that strictly only corrects orthographic\
    \ errors, and is thereby tailored to research and tool development for orthographic\
    \ issues in primary school. While for most corpora, transcription and target hypothesis\
    \ are not evaluated, we conducted a detailed inter-annotator agreement study for\
    \ both tasks. Although we achieved high agreement, our discussion of cases of\
    \ disagreement shows that even with detailed guidelines, annotators differ here\
    \ and there for different reasons, which should also be considered when working\
    \ with transcriptions and target hypotheses of other corpora, especially if no\
    \ explicit guidelines for their construction are known."

  abstract: We explore various supervised learning strategies for automated scoring
    of content knowledge for a large corpus of 130 different content-based questions
    spanning four subject areas (Science, Math, English Language Arts, and Social
    Studies) and containing over 230,000 responses scored by human raters. Based on
    our analyses, we provide specific recommendations for content scoring. These are
    based on patterns observed across multiple questions and assessments and are,
    therefore, likely to generalize to other scenarios and prove useful to the community
    as automated content scoring becomes more popular in schools and classrooms.

  abstract: In this paper we present the dataset of 200,000+ political arguments produced
    in the local phase of the 2016 Chilean constitutional process. We describe the
    human processing of this data by the government officials, and the manual tagging
    of arguments performed by members of our research group. Afterwards we focus on
    classification tasks that mimic the human processes, comparing linear methods
    with neural network architectures. The experiments show that some of the manual
    tasks are suitable for automatization. In particular, the best methods achieve
    a 90% top-5 accuracy in a multi-class classification of arguments, and 65% macro-averaged
    F1-score for tagging arguments according to a three-part argumentation model.

  abstract: 'Argumentative text has been analyzed both theoretically and computationally
    in terms of argumentative structure that consists of argument components (e.g.,
    claims, premises) and their argumentative relations (e.g., support, attack). Less
    emphasis has been placed on analyzing the semantic types of argument components.
    We propose a two-tiered annotation scheme to label claims and premises and their
    semantic types in an online persuasive forum, Change My View, with the long-term
    goal of understanding what makes a message persuasive. Premises are annotated
    with the three types of persuasive modes: ethos, logos, pathos, while claims are
    labeled as interpretation, evaluation, agreement, or disagreement, the latter
    two designed to account for the dialogical nature of our corpus. We aim to answer
    three questions: 1) can humans reliably annotate the semantic types of argument
    components? 2) are types of premises/claims positioned in recurrent orders? and
    3) are certain types of claims and/or premises more likely to appear in persuasive
    messages than in non-persuasive messages?'

  abstract: We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents,
    with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these. The first step, described
    in the current paper, concerns content selection, i.e., the question of which
    material should be extracted initially for the summary. In particular, we utilize
    the hierarchical argument structure of the judgment documents. Our main contributions
    are a) the design of an annotation scheme that stresses the connection between
    legal points (called issue topics) and argument structure, b) an adaptation of
    rhetorical status to suit the Japanese legal system and c) the definition of a
    linked argument structure based on legal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report
    agreement between two annotators on several aspects of the overall task.

  abstract: Stance classification is a core component in on-demand argument construction
    pipelines. Previous work on claim stance classification relied on background knowledge
    such as manually-composed sentiment lexicons. We show that both accuracy and coverage
    can be significantly improved through automatic expansion of the initial lexicon.
    We also developed a set of contextual features that further improves the state-of-the-art
    for this task.

  abstract: "This paper presents a method of extracting argumentative structure from\
    \ natural language text. The approach presented is based on the way in which we\
    \ understand an argument being made, not just from the words said, but from existing\
    \ contextual knowledge and understanding of the broader issues. We leverage high-precision,\
    \ low-recall techniques in order to automatically build a large corpus of inferential\
    \ statements related to the text\u2019s topic. These statements are then used\
    \ to produce a matrix representing the inferential relationship between different\
    \ aspects of the topic. From this matrix, we are able to determine connectedness\
    \ and directionality of inference between statements in the original text. By\
    \ following this approach, we obtain results that compare favourably to those\
    \ of other similar techniques to classify premise-conclusion pairs (with results\
    \ 22 points above baseline), but without the requirement of large volumes of annotated,\
    \ domain specific data."

  abstract: Computational argumentation is expected to play a critical role in the
    future of web search. To make this happen, many search-related questions must
    be revisited, such as how people query for arguments, how to mine arguments from
    the web, or how to rank them. In this paper, we develop an argument search framework
    for studying these and further questions. The framework allows for the composition
    of approaches to acquiring, mining, assessing, indexing, querying, retrieving,
    ranking, and presenting arguments while relying on standard infrastructure and
    interfaces. Based on the framework, we build a prototype search engine, called
    args, that relies on an initial, freely accessible index of nearly 300k arguments
    crawled from reliable web resources. The framework and the argument search engine
    are intended as an environment for collaborative research on computational argumentation
    and its practical evaluation.

  abstract: Argumentative corpora are costly to create and are available in only few
    languages with English dominating the area. In this paper we release the first
    publicly available Mandarin argumentative corpus. The corpus is created by exploiting
    the idea of comparable corpora from Statistical Machine Translation. We use existing
    corpora in English and manually map the claims and premises to comparable corpora
    in Mandarin. We also implement a simple solution to automate this approach with
    the view of creating argumentative corpora in other less-resourced languages.
    In this way we introduce a new task of multi-lingual argument mapping that can
    be evaluated using our English-Mandarin argumentative corpus. The preliminary
    results of our automatic argument mapper mirror the simplicity of our approach,
    but provide a baseline for further improvements.

  abstract: "Automatic claim detection is a fundamental argument mining task that\
    \ aims to automatically mine claims regarding a topic of consideration. Previous\
    \ works on mining argumentative content have assumed that a set of relevant documents\
    \ is given in advance. Here, we present a first corpus\u2013 wide claim detection\
    \ framework, that can be directly applied to massive corpora. Using simple and\
    \ intuitive empirical observations, we derive a claim sentence query by which\
    \ we are able to directly retrieve sentences in which the prior probability to\
    \ include topic-relevant claims is greatly enhanced. Next, we employ simple heuristics\
    \ to rank the sentences, leading to an unsupervised corpus\u2013wide claim detection\
    \ system, with precision that outperforms previously reported results on the task\
    \ of claim detection given relevant documents and labeled data."

  abstract: This paper offers a comparative analysis of the performance of different
    supervised machine learning methods and feature sets on argument mining tasks.
    Specifically, we address the tasks of extracting argumentative segments from texts
    and predicting the structure between those segments. Eight classifiers and different
    combinations of six feature types reported in previous work are evaluated. The
    results indicate that overall best performing features are the structural ones.
    Although the performance of classifiers varies depending on the feature combinations
    and corpora used for training and testing, Random Forest seems to be among the
    best performing classifiers. These results build a basis for further development
    of argument mining techniques and can guide an implementation of argument mining
    into different applications such as argument based search.

  abstract: In this paper we consider the insights that can be gained by considering
    large scale argument networks and the complex interactions between their constituent
    propositions. We investigate metrics for analysing properties of these networks,
    illustrating these using a corpus of arguments taken from the 2016 US Presidential
    Debates. We present techniques for determining these features directly from natural
    language text and show that there is a strong correlation between these automatically
    identified features and the argumentative structure contained within the text.
    Finally, we combine these metrics with argument mining techniques and show how
    the identification of argumentative relations can be improved by considering the
    larger context in which they occur.

  abstract: The segmentation of an argumentative text into argument units and their
    non-argumentative counterparts is the first step in identifying the argumentative
    structure of the text. Despite its importance for argument mining, unit segmentation
    has been approached only sporadically so far. This paper studies the major parameters
    of unit segmentation systematically. We explore the effectiveness of various features,
    when capturing words separately, along with their neighbors, or even along with
    the entire text. Each such context is reflected by one machine learning model
    that we evaluate within and across three domains of texts. Among the models, our
    new deep learning approach capturing the entire text turns out best within all
    domains, with an F-score of up to 88.54. While structural features generalize
    best across domains, the domain transfer remains hard, which points to major challenges
    of unit segmentation.

  abstract: "Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to express contempt\
    \ or ridicule. Often quoted as a challenge to sentiment analysis, sarcasm involves\
    \ use of words of positive or no polarity to convey negative sentiment. Incongruity\
    \ has been observed to be at the heart of sarcasm understanding in humans. Our\
    \ work in sarcasm detection identifies different forms of incongruity and employs\
    \ different machine learning techniques to capture them. This talk will describe\
    \ the approach, datasets and challenges in sarcasm detection using different forms\
    \ of incongruity. We identify two forms of incongruity: incongruity which can\
    \ be understood based on the target text and common background knowledge, and\
    \ incongruity which can be understood based on the target text and additional,\
    \ specific context. The former involves use of sentiment-based features, word\
    \ embeddings, and topic models. The latter involves creation of author\u2019s\
    \ historical context based on their historical data, and creation of conversational\
    \ context for sarcasm detection of dialogue."

  abstract: There has been a good amount of progress in sentiment analysis over the
    past 10 years, including the proposal of new methods and the creation of benchmark
    datasets. In some papers, however, there is a tendency to compare models only
    on one or two datasets, either because of time restraints or because the model
    is tailored to a specific task. Accordingly, it is hard to understand how well
    a certain model generalizes across different tasks and datasets. In this paper,
    we contribute to this situation by comparing several models on six different benchmarks,
    which belong to different domains and additionally have different levels of granularity
    (binary, 3-class, 4-class and 5-class). We show that Bi-LSTMs perform well across
    datasets and that both LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs are particularly good at fine-grained
    sentiment tasks (i.e., with more than two classes). Incorporating sentiment information
    into word embeddings during training gives good results for datasets that are
    lexically similar to the training data. With our experiments, we contribute to
    a better understanding of the performance of different model architectures on
    different data sets. Consequently, we detect novel state-of-the-art results on
    the SenTube datasets.

  abstract: There is a rich variety of data sets for sentiment analysis (viz., polarity
    and subjectivity classification). For the more challenging task of detecting discrete
    emotions following the definitions of Ekman and Plutchik, however, there are much
    fewer data sets, and notably no resources for the social media domain. This paper
    contributes to closing this gap by extending the SemEval 2016 stance and sentiment
    datasetwith emotion annotation. We (a) analyse annotation reliability and annotation
    merging; (b) investigate the relation between emotion annotation and the other
    annotation layers (stance, sentiment); (c) report modelling results as a baseline
    for future work.

  abstract: Social media are used by an increasing number of political actors. A small
    subset of these is interested in pursuing extremist motives such as mobilization,
    recruiting or radicalization activities. In order to counteract these trends,
    online providers and state institutions reinforce their monitoring efforts, mostly
    relying on manual workflows. We propose a machine learning approach to support
    manual attempts towards identifying right-wing extremist content in German Twitter
    profiles. Based on a fine-grained conceptualization of right-wing extremism, we
    frame the task as ranking each individual profile on a continuum spanning different
    degrees of right-wing extremism, based on a nearest neighbour approach. A quantitative
    evaluation reveals that our ranking model yields robust performance (up to 0.81
    F1 score) when being used for predicting discrete class labels. At the same time,
    the model provides plausible continuous ranking scores for a small sample of borderline
    cases at the division of right-wing extremism and New Right political movements.

  abstract: "We present the first shared task on detecting the intensity of emotion\
    \ felt by the speaker of a tweet. We create the first datasets of tweets annotated\
    \ for anger, fear, joy, and sadness intensities using a technique called best\u2013\
    worst scaling (BWS). We show that the annotations lead to reliable fine-grained\
    \ intensity scores (rankings of tweets by intensity). The data was partitioned\
    \ into training, development, and test sets for the competition. Twenty-two teams\
    \ participated in the shared task, with the best system obtaining a Pearson correlation\
    \ of 0.747 with the gold intensity scores. We summarize the machine learning setups,\
    \ resources, and tools used by the participating teams, with a focus on the techniques\
    \ and resources that are particularly useful for the task. The emotion intensity\
    \ dataset and the shared task are helping improve our understanding of how we\
    \ convey more or less intense emotions through language."

  abstract: "Our submission to the WASSA-2017 shared task on the prediction of emotion\
    \ intensity in tweets is a supervised learning method with extended lexicons of\
    \ affective norms. We combine three main information sources in a random forrest\
    \ regressor, namely (1), manually created resources, (2) automatically extended\
    \ lexicons, and (3) the output of a neural network (CNN-LSTM) for sentence regression.\
    \ All three feature sets perform similarly well in isolation (\u2248 .67 macro\
    \ average Pearson correlation). The combination achieves .72 on the official test\
    \ set (ranked 2nd out of 22 participants). Our analysis reveals that performance\
    \ is increased by providing cross-emotional intensity predictions. The automatic\
    \ extension of lexicon features benefit from domain specific embeddings. Complementary\
    \ ratings for affective norms increase the impact of lexicon features. Our resources\
    \ (ratings for 1.6 million twitter specific words) and our implementation is publicly\
    \ available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/ims_emoint."

  abstract: The paper describes the best performing system for EmoInt - a shared task
    to predict the intensity of emotions in tweets. Intensity is a real valued score,
    between 0 and 1. The emotions are classified as - anger, fear, joy and sadness.
    We apply three different deep neural network based models, which approach the
    problem from essentially different directions. Our final performance quantified
    by an average pearson correlation score of 74.7 and an average spearman correlation
    score of 73.5 is obtained using an ensemble of the three models. We outperform
    the baseline model of the shared task by 9.9% and 9.4% pearson and spearman correlation
    scores respectively.

  abstract: Claims are the building blocks of arguments and the reasons underpinning
    opinions, thus analyzing claims is important for both argumentation mining and
    opinion mining. We propose a framework for representing claims as microstructures,
    which express the beliefs, judgments, and policies about the relations between
    domain-specific concepts. In a proof-of-concept study, we manually build microstructures
    for over 800 claims extracted from an online debate. We test the so-obtained microstructures
    on the task of claim stance classification, achieving considerable improvements
    over text-based baselines.

  abstract: "Different theories posit different sources for feelings of well-being\
    \ and happiness. Appraisal theory grounds our emotional responses in our goals\
    \ and desires and their fulfillment, or lack of fulfillment. Self-Determination\
    \ theory posits that the basis for well-being rests on our assessments of our\
    \ competence, autonomy and social connection. And surveys that measure happiness\
    \ empirically note that people require their basic needs to be met for food and\
    \ shelter, but beyond that tend to be happiest when socializing, eating or having\
    \ sex. We analyze a corpus of private micro-blogs from a well-being application\
    \ called Echo, where users label each written post about daily events with a happiness\
    \ score between 1 and 9. Our goal is to ground the linguistic descriptions of\
    \ events that users experience in theories of well-being and happiness, and then\
    \ examine the extent to which different theoretical accounts can explain the variance\
    \ in the happiness scores. We show that recurrent event types, such as obligation\
    \ and incompetence, which affect people\u2019s feelings of well-being are not\

  abstract: 'Consumer spending is an important macroeconomic indicator that is used
    by policy-makers to judge the health of an economy. In this paper we present a
    novel method for predicting future consumer spending from social media data. In
    contrast to previous work that largely relied on sentiment analysis, the proposed
    method models consumer spending from purchase intentions found on social media.
    Our experiments with time series analysis models and machine-learning regression
    models reveal utility of this data for making short-term forecasts of consumer
    spending: for three- and seven-day horizons, prediction variables derived from
    social media help to improve forecast accuracy by 11% to 18% for all the three
    models, in comparison to models that used only autoregressive predictors.'

  abstract: Video reviews are the natural evolution of written product reviews. In
    this paper we target this phenomenon and introduce the first dataset created from
    closed captions of YouTube product review videos as well as a new attention-RNN
    model for aspect extraction and joint aspect extraction and sentiment classification.
    Our model provides state-of-the-art performance on aspect extraction without requiring
    the usage of hand-crafted features on the SemEval ABSA corpus, while it outperforms
    the baseline on the joint task. In our dataset, the attention-RNN model outperforms
    the baseline for both tasks, but we observe important performance drops for all
    models in comparison to SemEval. These results, as well as further experiments
    on domain adaptation for aspect extraction, suggest that differences between speech
    and written text, which have been discussed extensively in the literature, also
    extend to the domain of product reviews, where they are relevant for fine-grained
    opinion mining.

    We focus on the combination of the frog and the hot beverage emoji, but also show
    some preliminary results for other non-compositional emoji combinations. We use
    off-the-shelf sentiment analysers as well as manual classifications to approach
    the compositionality of these emoji combinations.

    \ analyzing the informative behaviour of emoji \u2013 an issue of importance for\
    \ sentiment analysis and natural language processing. The corpus consists of 2475\
    \ tweets all containing at least one emoji, which has been annotated using one\
    \ of the three possible classes: Redundant, Non Redundant, and Non Redundant +\
    \ POS. We explain how the corpus was collected, describe the annotation procedure\
    \ and the interface developed for the task. We provide an analysis of the corpus,\
    \ considering also possible predictive features, discuss the problematic aspects\
    \ of the annotation, and suggest future improvements."

  abstract: "Patients turn to Online Health Communities not only for information on\
    \ specific conditions but also for emotional support. Previous research has indicated\
    \ that the progression of emotional status can be studied through the linguistic\
    \ patterns of an individual\u2019s posts. We analyze a real-world dataset from\
    \ the Mental Health section of HealthBoards.com. Estimated from the word usages\
    \ in their posts, we find that the emotional progress across patients vary widely.\
    \ We study the problem of predicting a patient\u2019s emotional status in the\
    \ future from her past posts and we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based\
    \ architecture to address it. We find that the future emotional status can be\
    \ predicted with reasonable accuracy given her historical posts and participation\
    \ features. Our evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture,\

  abstract: As a discipline of Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis is
    used to extract and analyze subjective information present in natural language
    data. The task of Sentiment Analysis has acquired wide commercial uses including
    social media monitoring tasks, survey responses, review systems, etc. Languages
    like English have several resources which aid in the task of Sentiment Analysis.
    SentiWordNet and Subjectivity WordList are examples of such tools and resources.
    With more data being available in native vernacular, language-specific SentiWordNet(s)
    have become essential. For resource poor languages, creating such SentiWordNet(s)
    is a difficult task to achieve. One solution is to use available resources in
    English and translate the final source lexicon to target lexicon via machine translation.
    Machine translation systems for the English-Odia language pair have not yet been
    developed. In this paper, we discuss a method to create a SentiWordNet for Odia,
    which is resource-poor, by only using resources which are currently available
    for Indian languages. The lexicon created, would serve as a tool for Sentiment
    Analysis related task specific to Odia data.

  abstract: "With the advent of word embeddings, lexicons are no longer fully utilized\
    \ for sentiment analysis although they still provide important features in the\
    \ traditional setting. This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis\
    \ that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for word and lexicon\
    \ embeddings and provides a global view of the document using attention. Our models\
    \ are experimented on both the SemEval\u201916 Task 4 dataset and the Stanford\
    \ Sentiment Treebank and show comparative or better results against the existing\
    \ state-of-the-art systems. Our analysis shows that lexicon embeddings allow building\
    \ high-performing models with much smaller word embeddings, and the attention\
    \ mechanism effectively dims out noisy words for sentiment analysis."

  abstract: Recently, a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was
    shown to deliver insightful explanations in the form of input space relevances
    for understanding feed-forward neural network classification decisions. In the
    present work, we extend the usage of LRP to recurrent neural networks. We propose
    a specific propagation rule applicable to multiplicative connections as they arise
    in recurrent network architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply our technique
    to a word-based bi-directional LSTM model on a five-class sentiment prediction
    task, and evaluate the resulting LRP relevances both qualitatively and quantitatively,
    obtaining better results than a gradient-based related method which was used in
    previous work.

  abstract: The WASSA 2017 EmoInt shared task has the goal to predict emotion intensity
    values of tweet messages. Given the text of a tweet and its emotion category (anger,
    joy, fear, and sadness), the participants were asked to build a system that assigns
    emotion intensity values. Emotion intensity estimation is a challenging problem
    given the short length of the tweets, the noisy structure of the text and the
    lack of annotated data. To solve this problem, we developed an ensemble of two
    neural models, processing input on the character. and word-level with a lexicon-driven
    system. The correlation scores across all four emotions are averaged to determine
    the bottom-line competition metric, and our system ranks place forth in full intensity
    range and third in 0.5-1 range of intensity among 23 systems at the time of writing
    (June 2017).

  abstract: This paper describes the entry NUIG in the WASSA 2017 (8th Workshop on
    Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis) shared
    task on emotion recognition. The NUIG system used an SVR (SVM regression) and
    BLSTM ensemble, utilizing primarily n-grams (for SVR features) and tweet word
    embeddings (for BLSTM features). Experiments were carried out on several other
    candidate features, some of which were added to the SVR model. Parameter selection
    for the SVR model was run as a grid search whilst parameters for the BLSTM model
    were selected through a non-exhaustive ad-hoc search.

  abstract: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) identifies opinionated aspect terms in texts
    and is one of the tasks in the SemEval Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
    contest. The small amount of available datasets for supervised ATE and the costly
    human annotation for aspect term labelling give rise to the need for unsupervised
    ATE. In this paper, we introduce an architecture that achieves top-ranking performance
    for supervised ATE. Moreover, it can be used efficiently as feature extractor
    and classifier for unsupervised ATE. Our second contribution is a method to automatically
    construct datasets for ATE. We train a classifier on our automatically labelled
    datasets and evaluate it on the human annotated SemEval ABSA test sets. Compared
    to a strong rule-based baseline, we obtain a dramatically higher F-score and attain
    precision values above 80%. Our unsupervised method beats the supervised ABSA
    baseline from SemEval, while preserving high precision scores.

  abstract: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a rich dictionary that map
    words into several psychological categories such as Affective, Social, Cognitive,
    Perceptual and Biological processes. In this work, we have used LIWC psycholinguistic
    categories to train regression models and predict emotion intensity in tweets
    for the EmoInt-2017 task. Results show that LIWC features may boost emotion intensity
    prediction on the basis of a low dimension set.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present a system that uses a convolutional neural network
    with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model to complete the task. The CNN-LSTM
    model has two combined parts: CNN extracts local n-gram features within tweets
    and LSTM composes the features to capture long-distance dependency across tweets.
    Additionally, we used other three models (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM) as baseline algorithms.
    Our introduced model showed good performance in the experimental results.'

  abstract: This paper describes the system that we submitted as part of our participation
    in the shared task on Emotion Intensity (EmoInt-2017). We propose a Long short
    term memory (LSTM) based architecture cascaded with Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
    for intensity prediction. We also employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based
    feature selection algorithm for obtaining an optimized feature set for training
    and evaluation. System evaluation shows interesting results on the four emotion
    datasets i.e. anger, fear, joy and sadness. In comparison to the other participating
    teams our system was ranked 5th in the competition.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe a method to predict emotion intensity in tweets.
    Our approach is an ensemble of three regression methods. The first method uses
    content-based features (hashtags, emoticons, elongated words, etc.). The second
    method considers word n-grams and character n-grams for training. The final method
    uses lexicons, word embeddings, word n-grams, character n-grams for training the
    model. An ensemble of these three methods gives better performance than individual
    methods. We applied our method on WASSA emotion dataset. Achieved results are
    as follows: average Pearson correlation is 0.706, average Spearman correlation
    is 0.696, average Pearson correlation for gold scores in range 0.5 to 1 is 0.539,
    and average Spearman correlation for gold scores in range 0.5 to 1 is 0.514.'

  abstract: The EmoInt-2017 task aims to determine a continuous numerical value representing
    the intensity to which an emotion is expressed in a tweet. Compared to classification
    tasks that identify 1 among n emotions for a tweet, the present task can provide
    more fine-grained (real-valued) sentiment analysis. This paper presents a system
    that uses a bi-directional LSTM-CNN model to complete the competition task. Combining
    bi-directional LSTM and CNN, the prediction process considers both global information
    in a tweet and local important information. The proposed method ranked sixth among
    twenty-one teams in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a novel ensemble learning architecture for emotion
    intensity analysis, particularly a novel framework of ensemble method. The ensemble
    method has two stages and each stage includes several single machine learning
    models. In stage1, we employ both linear and nonlinear regression models to obtain
    a more diverse emotion intensity representation. In stage2, we use two regression
    models including linear regression and XGBoost. The result of stage1 serves as
    the input of stage2, so the two different type models (linear and non-linear)
    in stage2 can describe the input in two opposite aspects. We also added a method
    for analyzing and splitting multi-words hashtags and appending them to the emotion
    intensity corpus before feeding it to our model. Our model achieves 0.571 Pearson-measure
    for the average of four emotions.

    affect presence, sentiment intensity and sentiment presence lexica alongside pre-trained
    word embeddings, which are utilized to extract emotion intensity signals from
    tweets in an ensemble learning approach. The system employs emotion specific model

    Our system utilizes gradient boosted regression as the primary learning technique
    to predict the final emotion intensities.

  abstract: This working note presents the methodology used in deepCybErNet submission
    to the shared task on Emotion Intensities in Tweets (EmoInt) WASSA-2017. The goal
    of the task is to predict a real valued score in the range [0-1] for a particular
    tweet with an emotion type. To do this, we used Bag-of-Words and embedding based
    on recurrent network architecture. We have developed two systems and experiments
    are conducted on the Emotion Intensity shared Task 1 data base at WASSA-2017.
    A system which uses word embedding based on recurrent network architecture has
    achieved highest 5 fold cross-validation accuracy. This has used embedding with
    recurrent network to extract optimal features at tweet level and logistic regression
    for prediction. These methods are highly language independent and experimental
    results shows that the proposed methods are apt for predicting a real valued score
    in than range [0-1] for a given tweet with its emotion type.

  abstract: This paper presents the results of the RepEval 2017 Shared Task, which
    evaluated neural network sentence representation learning models on the Multi-Genre
    Natural Language Inference corpus (MultiNLI) recently introduced by Williams et
    al. (2017). All of the five participating teams beat the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
    and continuous bag of words baselines reported in Williams et al. The best single
    model used stacked BiLSTMs with residual connections to extract sentence features
    and reached 74.5% accuracy on the genre-matched test set. Surprisingly, the results
    of the competition were fairly consistent across the genre-matched and genre-mismatched
    test sets, and across subsets of the test data representing a variety of linguistic
    phenomena, suggesting that all of the submitted systems learned reasonably domain-independent
    representations for sentence meaning.

  abstract: "In this paper, we propose an alternative evaluating metric for word analogy\
    \ questions (A to B is as C to D) in word vector evaluation. Different from the\
    \ traditional method which predicts the fourth word by the given three, we measure\
    \ the similarity directly on the \u201Crelations\u201D of two pairs of given words,\
    \ just as shifting the relation vectors into a new analogy space. Cosine and Euclidean\
    \ distances are then calculated as measurements. Observation and experiments shows\
    \ the proposed analogy space evaluation could offer a more comprehensive evaluating\
    \ result on word vectors with word analogy questions. Meanwhile, computational\
    \ complexity are remarkably reduced by avoiding traversing the vocabulary."

  abstract: We introduce the cross-match test - an exact, distribution free, high-dimensional
    hypothesis test as an intrinsic evaluation metric for word embeddings. We show
    that cross-match is an effective means of measuring the distributional similarity
    between different vector representations and of evaluating the statistical significance
    of different vector embedding models. Additionally, we find that cross-match can
    be used to provide a quantitative measure of linguistic similarity for selecting
    bridge languages for machine translation. We demonstrate that the results of the
    hypothesis test align with our expectations and note that the framework of two
    sample hypothesis testing is not limited to word embeddings and can be extended
    to all vector representations.

  abstract: This work presents a framework for word similarity evaluation grounded
    on cognitive sciences experimental data. Word pair similarities are compared to
    reaction times of subjects in large scale lexical decision and naming tasks under
    semantic priming. Results show that GloVe embeddings lead to significantly higher
    correlation with experimental measurements than other controlled and off-the-shelf
    embeddings, and that the choice of a training corpus is less important than that
    of the algorithm. Comparison of rankings with other datasets shows that the cognitive
    phenomenon covers more aspects than simply word relatedness or similarity.

  abstract: Acquiring language provides a ubiquitous mode of communication, across
    humans and robots. To this effect, distributional representations of words based
    on co-occurrence statistics, have provided significant advancements ranging across
    machine translation to comprehension. In this paper, we study the suitability
    of using general purpose word-embeddings for language learning in robots. We propose
    using text-based games as a proxy to evaluating word embedding on real robots.
    Based in a risk-reward setting, we review the effectiveness of the embeddings
    in navigating tasks in fantasy games, as an approximation to their performance
    on more complex scenarios, like language assisted robot navigation.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of machine learning techniques
    and word embeddings to the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) in Social
    Media. We look at a manually labeled dataset consisting of user generated short
    texts posted on Twitter (tweets) and related to four recent media events (the
    Charlie Hebdo shooting, the Ottawa shooting, the Sydney Siege, and the German
    Wings crash) and test to what extent neural techniques and embeddings are able
    to distinguish between tweets that entail or contradict each other or that claim
    unrelated things. We obtain comparable results to the state of the art in a train-test
    setting, but we show that, due to the noisy aspect of the data, results plummet
    in an evaluation strategy crafted to better simulate a real-life train-test scenario.

  abstract: The RepEval 2017 Shared Task aims to evaluate natural language understanding
    models for sentence representation, in which a sentence is represented as a fixed-length
    vector with neural networks and the quality of the representation is tested with
    a natural language inference task. This paper describes our system (alpha) that
    is ranked among the top in the Shared Task, on both the in-domain test set (obtaining
    a 74.9% accuracy) and on the cross-domain test set (also attaining a 74.9% accuracy),
    demonstrating that the model generalizes well to the cross-domain data. Our model
    is equipped with intra-sentence gated-attention composition which helps achieve
    a better performance. In addition to submitting our model to the Shared Task,
    we have also tested it on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset.
    We obtain an accuracy of 85.5%, which is the best reported result on SNLI when
    cross-sentence attention is not allowed, the same condition enforced in RepEval
    2017.

  abstract: We present a simple sequential sentence encoder for multi-domain natural
    language inference. Our encoder is based on stacked bidirectional LSTM-RNNs with
    shortcut connections and fine-tuning of word embeddings. The overall supervised
    model uses the above encoder to encode two input sentences into two vectors, and
    then uses a classifier over the vector combination to label the relationship between
    these two sentences as that of entailment, contradiction, or neural. Our Shortcut-Stacked
    sentence encoders achieve strong improvements over existing encoders on matched
    and mismatched multi-domain natural language inference (top single-model result
    in the EMNLP RepEval 2017 Shared Task (Nangia et al., 2017)). Moreover, they achieve
    the new state-of-the-art encoding result on the original SNLI dataset (Bowman
    et al., 2015).

  abstract: Natural language inference (NLI) is a central problem in language understanding.
    End-to-end artificial neural networks have reached state-of-the-art performance
    in NLI field recently. In this paper, we propose Character-level Intra Attention
    Network (CIAN) for the NLI task. In our model, we use the character-level convolutional
    network to replace the standard word embedding layer, and we use the intra attention
    to capture the intra-sentence semantics. The proposed CIAN model provides improved
    results based on a newly published MNLI corpus.

  abstract: In this paper we present the model used by the team Rivercorners for the
    2017 RepEval shared task. First, our model separately encodes a pair of sentences
    into variable-length representations by using a bidirectional LSTM. Later, it
    creates fixed-length raw representations by means of simple aggregation functions,
    which are then refined using an attention mechanism. Finally it combines the refined
    representations of both sentences into a single vector to be used for classification.
    With this model we obtained test accuracies of 72.057% and 72.055% in the matched
    and mismatched evaluation tracks respectively, outperforming the LSTM baseline,
    and obtaining performances similar to a model that relies on shared information
    between sentences (ESIM). When using an ensemble both accuracies increased to
    72.247% and 72.827% respectively.

  abstract: This paper presents a summary of the first Workshop on Building Linguistically
    Generalizable Natural Language Processing Systems, and the associated Build It
    Break It, The Language Edition shared task. The goal of this workshop was to bring
    together researchers in NLP and linguistics with a carefully designed shared task
    aimed at testing the generalizability of NLP systems beyond the distributions
    of their training data. We describe the motivation, setup, and participation of
    the shared task, provide discussion of some highlighted results, and discuss lessons
    learned.

  abstract: We report results on benchmarking Open Information Extraction (OIE) systems
    using RelVis, a toolkit for benchmarking Open Information Extraction systems.
    Our comprehensive benchmark contains three data sets from the news domain and
    one data set from Wikipedia with overall 4522 labeled sentences and 11243 binary
    or n-ary OIE relations. In our analysis on these data sets we compared the performance
    of four popular OIE systems, ClausIE, OpenIE 4.2, Stanford OpenIE and PredPatt.
    In addition, we evaluated the impact of five common error classes on a subset
    of 749 n-ary tuples. From our deep analysis we unreveal important research directions
    for a next generation on OIE systems.

  abstract: "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (g2p) is necessary for text-to-speech\
    \ and automatic speech recognition systems. Most g2p systems are monolingual:\
    \ they require language-specific data or handcrafting of rules. Such systems are\
    \ difficult to extend to low resource languages, for which data and handcrafted\
    \ rules are not available. As an alternative, we present a neural sequence-to-sequence\
    \ approach to g2p which is trained on spelling\u2013pronunciation pairs in hundreds\
    \ of languages. The system shares a single encoder and decoder across all languages,\
    \ allowing it to utilize the intrinsic similarities between different writing\
    \ systems. We show an 11% improvement in phoneme error rate over an approach based\
    \ on adapting high-resource monolingual g2p models to low-resource languages.\
    \ Our model is also much more compact relative to previous approaches."

  abstract: 'Lexical Simplification is the task of reducing the lexical complexity
    of textual documents by replacing difficult words with easier to read (or understand)
    expressions while preserving the original meaning. The development of robust pipelined
    multilingual architectures able to adapt to new languages is of paramount importance
    in lexical simplification. This paper describes and evaluates a modular hybrid
    linguistic-statistical Lexical Simplifier that deals with the four major Ibero-Romance
    Languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Galician. The architecture of the
    system is the same for the four languages addressed, only the language resources
    used during simplification are language specific.'

  abstract: This paper challenges a cross-genre document retrieval task, where the
    queries are in formal writing and the target documents are in conversational writing.
    In this task, a query, is a sentence extracted from either a summary or a plot
    of an episode in a TV show, and the target document consists of transcripts from
    the corresponding episode. To establish a strong baseline, we employ the current
    state-of-the-art search engine to perform document retrieval on the dataset collected
    for this work. We then introduce a structure reranking approach to improve the
    initial ranking by utilizing syntactic and semantic structures generated by NLP
    tools. Our evaluation shows an improvement of more than 4% when the structure
    reranking is applied, which is very promising.

  abstract: "Sentiment analysis deals with the task of determining the polarity of\
    \ a document or sentence and has received a lot of attention in recent years for\
    \ the English language. With the rapid growth of social media these days, a lot\
    \ of data is available in regional languages besides English. Telugu is one such\
    \ regional language with abundant data available in social media, but it\u2019\
    s hard to find a labelled data of sentences for Telugu Sentiment Analysis. In\
    \ this paper, we describe an effort to build a gold-standard annotated corpus\
    \ of Telugu sentences to support Telugu Sentiment Analysis. The corpus, named\
    \ ACTSA (Annotated Corpus for Telugu Sentiment Analysis) has a collection of Telugu\
    \ sentences taken from different sources which were then pre-processed and manually\
    \ annotated by native Telugu speakers using our annotation guidelines. In total,\
    \ we have annotated 5457 sentences, which makes our corpus the largest resource\
    \ currently available. The corpus and the annotation guidelines are made publicly\

  abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to exploit phrase tables generated
    by statistical machine translation in order to map French discourse connectives
    to discourse relations. Using this approach, we created DisCoRel, a lexicon of
    French discourse connectives and their PDTB relations. When evaluated against
    LEXCONN, DisCoRel achieves a recall of 0.81 and an Average Precision of 0.68 for
    the Concession and Condition relations.

  abstract: Full text discourse parsing relies on texts comprehensively annotated
    with discourse relations. To this end, we address a significant gap in the inter-sentential
    discourse relations annotated in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), namely the
    class of cross-paragraph implicit relations, which account for 30% of inter-sentential
    relations in the corpus. We present our annotation study to explore the incidence
    rate of adjacent vs. non-adjacent implicit relations in cross-paragraph contexts,
    and the relative degree of difficulty in annotating them. Our experiments show
    a high incidence of non-adjacent relations that are difficult to annotate reliably,
    suggesting the practicality of backing off from their annotation to reduce noise
    for corpus-based studies. Our resulting guidelines follow the PDTB adjacency constraint
    for implicits while employing an underspecified representation of non-adjacent
    implicits, and yield 62% inter-annotator agreement on this task.

  abstract: We test state of the art dialogue systems for their behaviour in response
    to user-initiated sub-dialogues, i.e. interactions where a system question is
    responded to with a question or request from the user, who thus initiates a sub-dialogue.
    We look at sub-dialogues both within a single app (where the sub-dialogue concerns
    another topic in the original domain) and across apps (where the sub-dialogue
    concerns a different domain). The overall conclusion of the tests is that none
    of the systems can be said to deal appropriately with user-initiated sub-dialogues.

  abstract: Generative encoder-decoder models offer great promise in developing domain-general
    dialog systems. However, they have mainly been applied to open-domain conversations.
    This paper presents a practical and novel framework for building task-oriented
    dialog systems based on encoder-decoder models. This framework enables encoder-decoder
    models to accomplish slot-value independent decision-making and interact with
    external databases. Moreover, this paper shows the flexibility of the proposed
    method by interleaving chatting capability with a slot-filling system for better
    out-of-domain recovery. The models were trained on both real-user data from a
    bus information system and human-human chat data. Results show that the proposed
    framework achieves good performance in both offline evaluation metrics and in
    task success rate with human users.

  abstract: 'Neural task-oriented dialogue systems often struggle to smoothly interface
    with a knowledge base. In this work, we seek to address this problem by proposing
    a new neural dialogue agent that is able to effectively sustain grounded, multi-domain
    discourse through a novel key-value retrieval mechanism. The model is end-to-end
    differentiable and does not need to explicitly model dialogue state or belief
    trackers. We also release a new dataset of 3,031 dialogues that are grounded through
    underlying knowledge bases and span three distinct tasks in the in-car personal
    assistant space: calendar scheduling, weather information retrieval, and point-of-interest
    navigation. Our architecture is simultaneously trained on data from all domains
    and significantly outperforms a competitive rule-based system and other existing
    neural dialogue architectures on the provided domains according to both automatic
    and human evaluation metrics.'

  abstract: "We address the problem of acquiring the ontological categories of unknown\
    \ terms through implicit confirmation in dialogues. We develop an approach that\
    \ makes implicit confirmation requests with an unknown term\u2019s predicted category.\
    \ Our approach does not degrade user experience with repetitive explicit confirmations,\
    \ but the system has difficulty determining if information in the confirmation\
    \ request can be correctly acquired. To overcome this challenge, we propose a\
    \ method for determining whether or not the predicted category is correct, which\
    \ is included in an implicit confirmation request. Our method exploits multiple\
    \ user responses to implicit confirmation requests containing the same ontological\
    \ category. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method exhibited a\
    \ higher precision rate for determining the correctly predicted categories than\
    \ when only single user responses were considered."

  abstract: Recursive autoencoders (RAEs) for compositionality of a vector space model
    were applied to utterance intent classification of a smartphone-based Japanese-language
    spoken dialogue system. Though the RAEs express a nonlinear operation on the vectors
    of child nodes, the operation is considered to be different intrinsically depending
    on types of child nodes. To relax the difference, a data-driven untying of autoencoders
    (AEs) is proposed. The experimental result of the utterance intent classification
    showed an improved accuracy with the proposed method compared with the basic tied
    RAE and untied RAE based on a manual rule.

  abstract: Reinforcement learning is widely used for dialogue policy optimization
    where the reward function often consists of more than one component, e.g., the
    dialogue success and the dialogue length. In this work, we propose a structured
    method for finding a good balance between these components by searching for the
    optimal reward component weighting. To render this search feasible, we use multi-objective
    reinforcement learning to significantly reduce the number of training dialogues
    required. We apply our proposed method to find optimized component weights for
    six domains and compare them to a default baseline.

  abstract: This work aims at characterising verbal alignment processes for improving
    virtual agent communicative capabilities. We propose computationally inexpensive
    measures of verbal alignment based on expression repetition in dyadic textual
    dialogues. Using these measures, we present a contrastive study between Human-Human
    and Human-Agent dialogues on a negotiation task. We exhibit quantitative differences
    in the strength and orientation of verbal alignment showing the ability of our
    approach to characterise important aspects of verbal alignment.

    This demonstration shows both of these teaching methods applied to dialog systems
    in three domains: pizza ordering, restaurant information, and weather forecasts.'

  abstract: Human conversation is inherently complex, often spanning many different
    topics/domains. This makes policy learning for dialogue systems very challenging.
    Standard flat reinforcement learning methods do not provide an efficient framework
    for modelling such dialogues. In this paper, we focus on the under-explored problem
    of multi-domain dialogue management. First, we propose a new method for hierarchical
    reinforcement learning using the option framework. Next, we show that the proposed
    architecture learns faster and arrives at a better policy than the existing flat
    ones do. Moreover, we show how pretrained policies can be adapted to more complex
    systems with an additional set of new actions. In doing that, we show that our
    approach has the potential to facilitate policy optimisation for more sophisticated
    multi-domain dialogue systems.

  abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a key component of goal oriented
    dialogue systems that would parse user utterances into semantic frame representations.
    Traditionally SLU does not utilize the dialogue history beyond the previous system
    turn and contextual ambiguities are resolved by the downstream components. In
    this paper, we explore novel approaches for modeling dialogue context in a recurrent
    neural network (RNN) based language understanding system. We propose the Sequential
    Dialogue Encoder Network, that allows encoding context from the dialogue history
    in chronological order. We compare the performance of our proposed architecture
    with two context models, one that uses just the previous turn context and another
    that encodes dialogue context in a memory network, but loses the order of utterances
    in the dialogue history. Experiments with a multi-domain dialogue dataset demonstrate
    that the proposed architecture results in reduced semantic frame error rates.

  abstract: "Conversational agents offer users a natural-language interface to accomplish\
    \ tasks, entertain themselves, or access information. Informational dialogue is\
    \ particularly challenging in that the agent has to hold a conversation on an\
    \ open topic, and to achieve a reasonable coverage it generally needs to digest\
    \ and present unstructured information from textual sources. Making responses\
    \ based on such sources sound natural and fit appropriately into the conversation\
    \ context is a topic of ongoing research, one of the key issues of which is preventing\
    \ the agent\u2019s responses from sounding repetitive. Targeting this issue, we\
    \ propose a new task, known as redundancy localization, which aims to pinpoint\
    \ semantic overlap between text passages. To help address it systematically, we\
    \ formalize the task, prepare a public dataset with fine-grained redundancy labels,\
    \ and propose a model utilizing a weak training signal defined over the results\
    \ of a passage-retrieval system on web texts. The proposed model demonstrates\
    \ superior performance compared to a state-of-the-art entailment model and yields\
    \ encouraging results when applied to a real-world dialogue."

  abstract: Attentive listening systems are designed to let people, especially senior
    people, keep talking to maintain communication ability and mental health. This
    paper addresses key components of an attentive listening system which encourages
    users to talk smoothly. First, we introduce continuous prediction of end-of-utterances
    and generation of backchannels, rather than generating backchannels after end-point
    detection of utterances. This improves subjective evaluations of backchannels.
    Second, we propose an effective statement response mechanism which detects focus
    words and responds in the form of a question or partial repeat. This can be applied
    to any statement. Moreover, a flexible turn-taking mechanism is designed which
    uses backchannels or fillers when the turn-switch is ambiguous. These techniques
    are integrated into a humanoid robot to conduct attentive listening. We test the
    feasibility of the system in a pilot experiment and show that it can produce coherent
    dialogues during conversation.

  abstract: Recent spoken dialog systems are moving away from command and control
    towards a more intuitive and natural style of interaction. In order to choose
    an appropriate system design which allows the system to deal with naturally spoken
    user input, a definition of what exactly constitutes naturalness in user input
    is important. In this paper, we examine how different user groups naturally speak
    to an automotive spoken dialog system (SDS). We conduct a user study in which
    we collect freely spoken user utterances for a wide range of use cases in German.
    By means of a comparative study of the utterances from the study with interpersonal
    utterances, we provide criteria what constitutes naturalness in the user input
    of an state-of-the-art automotive SDS.

  abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have significant potential for
    dialogue policy optimisation. However, they suffer from a poor performance in
    the early stages of learning. This is especially problematic for on-line learning
    with real users. Two approaches are introduced to tackle this problem. Firstly,
    to speed up the learning process, two sample-efficient neural networks algorithms:
    trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and episodic natural
    actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER) are presented. For TRACER, the trust
    region helps to control the learning step size and avoid catastrophic model changes.
    For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the steepest ascent direction in policy
    space to speed up the convergence. Both models employ off-policy learning with
    experience replay to improve sample-efficiency. Secondly, to mitigate the cold
    start issue, a corpus of demonstration data is utilised to pre-train the models
    prior to on-line reinforcement learning. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate
    a practical approach to learn deep RL-based dialogue policies and demonstrate
    their effectiveness in a task-oriented information seeking domain.'

  abstract: For estimating the Interaction Quality (IQ) in Spoken Dialogue Systems
    (SDS), the dialogue history is of significant importance. Previous works included
    this information manually in the form of precomputed temporal features into the
    classification process. Here, we employ a deep learning architecture based on
    Long Short-Term Memories (LSTM) to extract this information automatically from
    the data, thus estimating IQ solely by using current exchange features. We show
    that it is thereby possible to achieve competitive results as in a scenario where
    manually optimized temporal features have been included.

  abstract: Conversational interfaces recently gained a lot of attention. One of the
    reasons for the current hype is the fact that chatbots (one particularly popular
    form of conversational interfaces) nowadays can be created without any programming
    knowledge, thanks to different toolkits and so-called Natural Language Understanding
    (NLU) services. While these NLU services are already widely used in both, industry
    and science, so far, they have not been analysed systematically. In this paper,
    we present a method to evaluate the classification performance of NLU services.
    Moreover, we present two new corpora, one consisting of annotated questions and
    one consisting of annotated questions with the corresponding answers. Based on
    these corpora, we conduct an evaluation of some of the most popular NLU services.
    Thereby we want to enable both, researchers and companies to make more educated
    decisions about which service they should use.

  abstract: "Computational models for sarcasm detection have often relied on the content\
    \ of utterances in isolation. However, speaker\u2019s sarcastic intent is not\
    \ always obvious without additional context. Focusing on social media discussions,\
    \ we investigate two issues: (1) does modeling of conversation context help in\
    \ sarcasm detection and (2) can we understand what part of conversation context\
    \ triggered the sarcastic reply. To address the first issue, we investigate several\
    \ types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that can model both the conversation\
    \ context and the sarcastic response. We show that the conditional LSTM network\
    \ (Rockt\xE4schel et al. 2015) and LSTM networks with sentence level attention\
    \ on context and response outperform the LSTM model that reads only the response.\
    \ To address the second issue, we present a qualitative analysis of attention\
    \ weights produced by the LSTM models with attention and discuss the results compared\
    \ with human performance on the task."

  abstract: 'This paper describes the E2E data, a new dataset for training end-to-end,
    data-driven natural language generation systems in the restaurant domain, which
    is ten times bigger than existing, frequently used datasets in this area. The
    E2E dataset poses new challenges: (1) its human reference texts show more lexical
    richness and syntactic variation, including discourse phenomena; (2) generating
    from this set requires content selection. As such, learning from this dataset
    promises more natural, varied and less template-like system utterances. We also
    establish a baseline on this dataset, which illustrates some of the difficulties
    associated with this data.'

  abstract: This paper proposes a new dataset, Frames, composed of 1369 human-human
    dialogues with an average of 15 turns per dialogue. This corpus contains goal-oriented
    dialogues between users who are given some constraints to book a trip and assistants
    who search a database to find appropriate trips. The users exhibit complex decision-making
    behaviour which involve comparing trips, exploring different options, and selecting
    among the trips that were discussed during the dialogue. To drive research on
    dialogue systems towards handling such behaviour, we have annotated and released
    the dataset and we propose in this paper a task called frame tracking. This task
    consists of keeping track of different semantic frames throughout each dialogue.
    We propose a rule-based baseline and analyse the frame tracking task through this
    baseline.

  abstract: Previous models of turn-taking have mostly been trained for specific turn-taking
    decisions, such as discriminating between turn shifts and turn retention in pauses.
    In this paper, we present a predictive, continuous model of turn-taking using
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model is trained
    on human-human dialogue data to predict upcoming speech activity in a future time
    window. We show how this general model can be applied to two different tasks that
    it was not specifically trained for. First, to predict whether a turn-shift will
    occur or not in pauses, where the model achieves a better performance than human
    observers, and better than results achieved with more traditional models. Second,
    to make a prediction at speech onset whether the utterance will be a short backchannel
    or a longer utterance. Finally, we show how the hidden layer in the network can
    be used as a feature vector for turn-taking decisions in a human-robot interaction
    scenario.

  abstract: 'Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component in spoken
    dialogue systems. This paper presents a model called Encoder-Aggregator-Decoder
    which is an extension of an Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder architecture.
    The proposed Semantic Aggregator consists of two components: an Aligner and a
    Refiner. The Aligner is a conventional attention calculated over the encoded input
    information, while the Refiner is another attention or gating mechanism stacked
    over the attentive Aligner in order to further select and aggregate the semantic
    elements. The proposed model can be jointly trained both sentence planning and
    surface realization to produce natural language utterances. The model was extensively
    assessed on four different NLG domains, in which the experimental results showed
    that the proposed generator consistently outperforms the previous methods on all
    the NLG domains.'

  abstract: "A common convention in graphical user interfaces is to indicate a \u201C\
    wait state\u201D, for example while a program is preparing a response, through\
    \ a changed cursor state or a progress bar. What should the analogue be in a spoken\
    \ conversational system? To address this question, we set up an experiment in\
    \ which a human information provider (IP) was given their information only in\
    \ a delayed and incremental manner, which systematically created situations where\
    \ the IP had the turn but could not provide task-related information. Our data\
    \ analysis shows that 1) IPs bridge the gap until they can provide information\
    \ by re-purposing a whole variety of task- and grounding-related communicative\
    \ actions (e.g. echoing the user\u2019s request, signaling understanding, asserting\
    \ partially relevant information), rather than being silent or explicitly asking\
    \ for time (e.g. \u201Cplease wait\u201D), and that 2) IPs combined these actions\
    \ productively to ensure an ongoing conversation. These results, we argue, indicate\
    \ that natural conversational interfaces should also be able to manage their time\
    \ flexibly using a variety of conversational resources."

    which combine recurrent neural network architectures and attention mechanisms
    (AMs) at different context levels. Our experimental results on two benchmark datasets
    show consistent improvements compared to the models without contextual information
    and reveal that the most suitable AM in the architecture depends on the nature

  abstract: In goal-driven dialogue systems, success is often defined based on a structured
    definition of the goal. This requires that the dialogue system be constrained
    to handle a specific class of goals and that there be a mechanism to measure success
    with respect to that goal. However, in many human-human dialogues the diversity
    of goals makes it infeasible to define success in such a way. To address this
    scenario, we consider the task of automatically predicting success in goal-driven
    human-human dialogues using only the information communicated between participants
    in the form of text. We build a dataset from stackoverflow.com which consists
    of exchanges between two users in the technical domain where ground-truth success
    labels are available. We then propose a turn-based hierarchical neural network
    model that can be used to predict success without requiring a structured goal
    definition. We show this model outperforms rule-based heuristics and other baselines
    as it is able to detect patterns over the course of a dialogue and capture notions
    such as gratitude.

  abstract: We define and motivate the problem of summarizing partial email threads.
    This problem introduces the challenge of generating reference summaries for partial
    threads when human annotation is only available for the threads as a whole, particularly
    when the human-selected sentences are not uniformly distributed within the threads.
    We propose an oracular algorithm for generating these reference summaries with
    arbitrary length, and we are making the resulting dataset publicly available.
    In addition, we apply a recent unsupervised method based on Bayesian Surprise
    that incorporates background knowledge into partial thread summarization, extend
    it with conversational features, and modify the mechanism by which it handles
    redundancy. Experiments with our method indicate improved performance over the
    baseline for shorter partial threads; and our results suggest that the potential
    benefits of background knowledge to partial thread summarization should be further
    investigated with larger datasets.

  abstract: We investigate the potential of adversarial evaluation methods for open-domain
    dialogue generation systems, comparing the performance of a discriminative agent
    to that of humans on the same task. Our results show that the task is hard, both
    for automated models and humans, but that a discriminative agent can learn patterns
    that lead to above-chance performance.

  abstract: 'Discourse Parsing and Sentiment Analysis are two fundamental tasks in
    Natural Language Processing that have been shown to be mutually beneficial. In
    this work, we design and compare two Neural Based models for jointly learning
    both tasks. In the proposed approach, we first create a vector representation
    for all the text segments in the input sentence. Next, we apply three different
    Recursive Neural Net models: one for discourse structure prediction, one for discourse
    relation prediction and one for sentiment analysis. Finally, we combine these
    Neural Nets in two different joint models: Multi-tasking and Pre-training. Our
    results on two standard corpora indicate that both methods result in improvements
    in each task but Multi-tasking has a bigger impact than Pre-training. Specifically
    for Discourse Parsing, we see improvements in the prediction of the set of contrastive
    relations.'

  abstract: Intelligent assistants (IAs) such as Siri and Cortana conversationally
    interact with users and execute a wide range of actions (e.g., searching the Web,
    setting alarms, and chatting). IAs can support these actions through the combination
    of various components such as automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding,
    and language generation. However, the complexity of these components hinders developers
    from determining which component causes an error. To remove this hindrance, we
    focus on reformulation, which is a useful signal of user dissatisfaction, and
    propose a method to predict the reformulation causes. We evaluate the method using
    the user logs of a commercial IA. The experimental results have demonstrated that
    features designed to detect the error of a specific component improve the performance
    of reformulation cause detection.

  abstract: "Effective models of social dialog must understand a broad range of rhetorical\
    \ and figurative devices. Rhetorical questions (RQs) are a type of figurative\
    \ language whose aim is to achieve a pragmatic goal, such as structuring an argument,\
    \ being persuasive, emphasizing a point, or being ironic. While there are computational\
    \ models for other forms of figurative language, rhetorical questions have received\
    \ little attention to date. We expand a small dataset from previous work, presenting\
    \ a corpus of 10,270 RQs from debate forums and Twitter that represent different\
    \ discourse functions. We show that we can clearly distinguish between RQs and\
    \ sincere questions (0.76 F1). We then show that RQs can be used both sarcastically\
    \ and non-sarcastically, observing that non-sarcastic (other) uses of RQs are\
    \ frequently argumentative in forums, and persuasive in tweets. We present experiments\
    \ to distinguish between these uses of RQs using SVM and LSTM models that represent\
    \ linguistic features and post-level context, achieving results as high as 0.76\
    \ F1 for \u201Csarcastic\u201D and 0.77 F1 for \u201Cother\u201D in forums, and\
    \ 0.83 F1 for both \u201Csarcastic\u201D and \u201Cother\u201D in tweets. We supplement\
    \ our quantitative experiments with an in-depth characterization of the linguistic\
    \ variation in RQs."

  abstract: In this paper, we present a novel and highly effective method for induction
    and application of metaphor frame templates as a step toward detecting metaphor
    in extended discourse. We infer implicit facets of a given metaphor frame using
    a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach on an unlabeled corpus. Our model applies
    this frame facet information to metaphor detection, and achieves the state-of-the-art
    performance on a social media dataset when building upon other proven features
    in a nonlinear machine learning model. In addition, we illustrate the mechanism
    through which the frame and topic information enable the more accurate metaphor
    detection.

  abstract: We apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of incremental dialogue
    policy learning in the context of a fast-paced dialogue game. We compare the policy
    learned by RL with a high-performance baseline policy which has been shown to
    perform very efficiently (nearly as well as humans) in this dialogue game. The
    RL policy outperforms the baseline policy in offline simulations (based on real
    user data). We provide a detailed comparison of the RL policy and the baseline
    policy, including information about how much effort and time it took to develop
    each one of them. We also highlight the cases where the RL policy performs better,
    and show that understanding the RL policy can provide valuable insights which
    can inform the creation of an even better rule-based policy.

  abstract: "To understand narrative, humans draw inferences about the underlying\
    \ relations between narrative events. Cognitive theories of narrative understanding\
    \ define these inferences as four different types of causality, that include pairs\
    \ of events A, B where A physically causes B (X drop, X break), to pairs of events\
    \ where A causes emotional state B (Y saw X, Y felt fear). Previous work on learning\
    \ narrative relations from text has either focused on \u201Cstrict\u201D physical\
    \ causality, or has been vague about what relation is being learned. This paper\
    \ learns pairs of causal events from a corpus of film scene descriptions which\
    \ are action rich and tend to be told in chronological order. We show that event\
    \ pairs induced using our methods are of high quality and are judged to have a\
    \ stronger causal relation than event pairs from Rel-Grams."

  abstract: We demonstrate an information navigation system for sightseeing domains
    that has a dialogue interface for discovering user interests for tourist activities.
    The system discovers interests of a user with focus detection on user utterances,
    and proactively presents related information to the discovered user interest.
    A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)-based dialogue manager,
    which is extended with user focus states, controls the behavior of the system
    to provide information with several dialogue acts for providing information. We
    transferred the belief-update function and the policy of the manager from other
    system trained on a different domain to show the generality of defined dialogue
    acts for our information navigation system.

    to our predilection for organizing our experiences as narratives. There is broad
    consensus that understanding a narrative requires identifying and tracking the
    goals and desires of the characters and their narrative outcomes. However, to
    date, there has been limited work on computational models for this problem. We
    introduce a new dataset, DesireDB, which includes gold-standard labels for identifying
    statements of desire, textual evidence for desire fulfillment, and annotations
    for whether the stated desire is fulfilled given the evidence in the narrative
    context. We report experiments on tracking desire fulfillment using different
    methods, and show that LSTM Skip-Thought model achieves F-measure of 0.7 on our
    corpus.

  abstract: Building dialogue interfaces for real-world scenarios often entails training
    semantic parsers starting from zero examples. How can we build datasets that better
    capture the variety of ways users might phrase their queries, and what queries
    are actually realistic? Wang et al. (2015) proposed a method to build semantic
    parsing datasets by generating canonical utterances using a grammar and having
    crowdworkers paraphrase them into natural wording. A limitation of this approach
    is that it induces bias towards using similar language as the canonical utterances.
    In this work, we present a methodology that elicits meaningful and lexically diverse
    queries from users for semantic parsing tasks. Starting from a seed lexicon and
    a generative grammar, we pair logical forms with mixed text-image representations
    and ask crowdworkers to paraphrase and confirm the plausibility of the queries
    that they generated. We use this method to build a semantic parsing dataset from
    scratch for a dialog agent in a smart-home simulation. We find evidence that this
    dataset, which we have named SmartHome, is demonstrably more lexically diverse
    and difficult to parse than existing domain-specific semantic parsing datasets.

  abstract: Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data
    to estimate their parameters and are therefore usually learned on large corpora
    such as chat forums or movie subtitles. These corpora are, however, often challenging
    to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn segmentation and the
    presence of multiple references external to the dialogue itself. This paper shows
    that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a weighting model into the architecture.
    The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates
    each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality
    for dialogue modelling. At training time, these sample weights are included into
    the empirical loss to be minimised. Evaluation results on retrieval-based models
    trained on movie and TV subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting
    model improves the model performance on unsupervised metrics.

  abstract: This article describes a model of other-initiated self-repair for a chatbot
    that helps to practice conversation in a foreign language. The model was developed
    using a corpus of instant messaging conversations between German native and non-native
    speakers. Conversation Analysis helped to create computational models from a small
    number of examples. The model has been validated in an AIML-based chatbot. Unlike
    typical retrieval-based dialogue systems, the explanations are generated at run-time
    from a linguistic database.

  abstract: We propose a novel method to bootstrap the construction of parallel corpora
    for new pairs of structurally different languages. We do so by combining the use
    of a pivot language and self-training. A pivot language enables the use of existing
    translation models to bootstrap the alignment and a self-training procedure enables
    to achieve better alignment, both at the document and sentence level. We also
    propose several evaluation methods for the resulting alignment.

  abstract: Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision is a
    promising effort. However, the applicability of these methods directly depends
    on the availability of a specific multimodal data that includes images and texts.
    In this paper, we present a collection of a Multimodal corpus of comparable texts
    and their images in 9 languages from the web news articles of Euronews website.
    This corpus has found widespread use in the NLP community in Multilingual and
    multimodal tasks. Here, we focus on its acquisition of the images and text data
    and their multilingual alignment.

  abstract: Learning phrase representations has been widely explored in many Natural
    Language Processing tasks (e.g., Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation) and
    has shown promising improvements. Previous studies either learn non-compositional
    phrase representations with general word embedding learning techniques or learn
    compositional phrase representations based on syntactic structures, which either
    require huge amounts of human annotations or cannot be easily generalized to all
    phrases. In this work, we propose to take advantage of large-scaled paraphrase
    database and present a pairwise-GRU framework to generate compositional phrase
    representations. Our framework can be re-used to generate representations for
    any phrases. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
    results on several phrase similarity tasks.

  abstract: We propose prefix constraints, a novel method to enforce constraints on
    target sentences in neural machine translation. It places a sequence of special
    tokens at the beginning of target sentence (target prefix), while side constraints
    places a special token at the end of source sentence (source suffix). Prefix constraints
    can be predicted from source sentence jointly with target sentence, while side
    constraints (Sennrich et al., 2016) must be provided by the user or predicted
    by some other methods. In both methods, special tokens are designed to encode
    arbitrary features on target-side or metatextual information. We show that prefix
    constraints are more flexible than side constraints and can be used to control
    the behavior of neural machine translation, in terms of output length, bidirectional
    decoding, domain adaptation, and unaligned target word generation.

  abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) produces sentences that are more fluent
    than those produced by statistical machine translation (SMT). However, NMT has
    a very high computational cost because of the high dimensionality of the output
    layer. Generally, NMT restricts the size of vocabulary, which results in infrequent
    words being treated as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and degrades the performance of
    the translation. In evaluation, we achieved a statistically significant BLEU score
    improvement of 0.55-0.77 over the baselines including the state-of-the-art method.

  abstract: Large-scale parallel corpora are indispensable to train highly accurate
    machine translators. However, manually constructed large-scale parallel corpora
    are not freely available in many language pairs. In previous studies, training
    data have been expanded using a pseudo-parallel corpus obtained using machine
    translation of the monolingual corpus in the target language. However, in low-resource
    language pairs in which only low-accuracy machine translation systems can be used,
    translation quality is reduces when a pseudo-parallel corpus is used naively.
    To improve machine translation performance with low-resource language pairs, we
    propose a method to expand the training data effectively via filtering the pseudo-parallel
    corpus using a quality estimation based on back-translation. As a result of experiments
    with three language pairs using small, medium, and large parallel corpora, language
    pairs with fewer training data filtered out more sentence pairs and improved BLEU
    scores more significantly.

  abstract: Aiming at facilitating the research on quality estimation (QE) and automatic
    post-editing (APE) of machine translation (MT) outputs, especially for those among
    Asian languages, we have created new datasets for Japanese to English, Chinese,
    and Korean translations. As the source text, actual utterances in Japanese were
    extracted from the log data of our speech translation service. MT outputs were
    then given by phrase-based statistical MT systems. Finally, human evaluators were
    employed to grade the quality of MT outputs and to post-edit them. This paper
    describes the characteristics of the created datasets and reports on our benchmarking
    experiments on word-level QE, sentence-level QE, and APE conducted using the created
    datasets.

  abstract: In this year, we participated in four translation subtasks at WAT 2017.
    Our model structure is quite simple but we used it with well-tuned hyper-parameters,
    leading to a significant improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art
    system. We also tried to make use of the unreliable part of the provided parallel
    corpus by back-translating and making a synthetic corpus. Our submitted system
    achieved the new state-of-the-art performance in terms of the BLEU score, as well
    as human evaluation.

  abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) cannot handle a larger vocabulary because
    the training complexity and decoding complexity proportionally increase with the
    number of target words. This problem becomes even more serious when translating
    patent documents, which contain many technical terms that are observed infrequently.
    Long et al.(2017) proposed to select phrases that contain out-of-vocabulary words
    using the statistical approach of branching entropy. The selected phrases are
    then replaced with tokens during training and post-translated by the phrase translation
    table of SMT. In this paper, we apply the method proposed by Long et al. (2017)
    to the WAT 2017 Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-English patent datasets. Evaluation
    on Japanese-to-Chinese, Chinese-to-Japanese, Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese
    patent sentence translation proved the effectiveness of phrases selected with
    branching entropy, where the NMT model of Long et al.(2017) achieves a substantial
    improvement over a baseline NMT model without the technique proposed by Long et
    al.(2017).

    JPCen-ja, JPCzh-ja and JPCko-ja. Although the basic architecture of our system
    is NMT, reranking technique is conducted using SMT results. One of the major drawback
    of NMT is under-translation and over-translation. On the other hand, SMT infrequently
    makes such translations. So, using reranking of n-best NMT outputs by the SMT
    output, discarding such translations can be expected. We can improve BLEU score
    from 46.03 to 47.08 by this technique in JPCzh-ja task.'

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the NICT-2 neural machine translation system
    evaluated at WAT2017. This system uses multiple models as an ensemble and combines
    models with opposite decoding directions by reranking (called bi-directional reranking).
    In our experimental results on small data sets, the translation quality improved
    when the number of models was increased to 32 in total and did not saturate. In
    the experiments on large data sets, improvements of 1.59-3.32 BLEU points were
    achieved when six-model ensembles were combined by the bi-directional reranking.

  abstract: We describe here our approaches and results on the WAT 2017 shared translation
    tasks. Following our good results with Neural Machine Translation in the previous
    shared task, we continue this approach this year, with incremental improvements
    in models and training methods. We focused on the ASPEC dataset and could improve
    the state-of-the-art results for Chinese-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-Chinese translations.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our neural machine translation (NMT) system,
    which is based on the attention-based NMT and uses long short-term memories (LSTM)
    as RNN. We implemented beam search and ensemble decoding in the NMT system. The
    system was tested on the 4th Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT 2017) shared tasks.
    In our experiments, we participated in the scientific paper subtasks and attempted
    Japanese-English, English-Japanese, and Japanese-Chinese translation tasks. The
    experimental results showed that implementation of beam search and ensemble decoding
    can effectively improve the translation quality.

  abstract: "A classifier for automatic detection of stance towards vaccination in\
    \ online forums was trained and evaluated. Debate posts from six discussion threads\
    \ on the British parental website Mumsnet were manually annotated for stance \u2018\
    against\u2019 or \u2018for\u2019 vaccination, or as \u2018undecided\u2019. A support\
    \ vector machine, trained to detect the three classes, achieved a macro F-score\
    \ of 0.44, while a macro F-score of 0.62 was obtained by the same type of classifier\
    \ on the binary classification task of distinguishing stance \u2018against\u2019\
    \ vaccination from stance \u2018for\u2019 vaccination. These results show that\
    \ vaccine stance detection in online forums is a difficult task, at least for\
    \ the type of model investigated and for the relatively small training corpus\
    \ that was used. Future work will therefore include an expansion of the training\
    \ data and an evaluation of other types of classifiers and features."

  abstract: "To date, various Twitter-based event detection systems have been proposed.\
    \ Most of their targets, however, share common characteristics. They are seasonal\
    \ or global events such as earthquakes and flu pandemics. In contrast, this study\
    \ targets unseasonal and local disease events. Our system investigates the frequencies\
    \ of disease-related words such as \u201Cnausea\u201D,\u201Cchill\u201D,and \u201C\
    diarrhea\u201D and estimates the number of patients using regression of these\
    \ word frequencies. Experiments conducted using Japanese 47 areas from January\
    \ 2017 to April 2017 revealed that the detection of small and unseasonal event\
    \ is extremely difficult (overall performance: 0.13). However, we found that the\
    \ event scale and the detection performance show high correlation in the specified\
    \ cases (in the phase of patient increasing or decreasing). The results also suggest\
    \ that when 150 and more patients appear in a high population area, we can expect\
    \ that our social sensors detect this outbreak. Based on these results, we can\
    \ infer that social sensors can reliably detect unseasonal and local disease events\
    \ under certain conditions, just as they can for seasonal or global events."

    \ it can be used to develop models to understand or predict user behavior on social\

    \ is to use the social media platforms to analyze users\u2019 health-related information.\
    \ In this study, we developed a tree kernel-based model to classify tweets conveying\
    \ pregnancy related information using this corpus. The developed pregnancy classification\
    \ model achieved an accuracy of 0.847 and an F-score of 0.565. A new corpus from\

  abstract: "Traditional disease surveillance systems depend on outpatient reporting\
    \ and virological test results released by hospitals. These data have valid and\
    \ accurate information about emerging outbreaks but it\u2019s often not timely.\
    \ In recent years the exponential growth of users getting connected to social\

    \ Social media can now flag more immediate concerns related to out-breaks in real\
    \ time. In this paper we apply the long short-term memory recurrent neural net-work\
    \ (RNN) architecture to classify tweets conveyed influenza-related information\
    \ and compare its performance with baseline algorithms including support vector\
    \ machine (SVM), decision tree, naive Bayes, simple logistics, and naive Bayes\
    \ multinomial. The developed RNN model achieved an F-score of 0.845 on the MedWeb\
    \ task test set, which outperforms the F-score of SVM without applying the synthetic\
    \ minority oversampling technique by 0.08. The F-score of the RNN model is within\

  abstract: Effective response to infectious diseases outbreaks relies on the rapid
    and early detection of those outbreaks. Invalidated, yet timely and openly available
    digital information can be used for the early detection of outbreaks. Public health
    surveillance authorities can exploit these early warnings to plan and co-ordinate
    rapid surveillance and emergency response programs. In 2016, a digital disease
    detection competition named ZikaHack was launched. The objective of the competition
    was for multidisciplinary teams to design, develop and demonstrate innovative
    digital disease detection solutions to retrospectively detect the 2015-16 Brazilian
    Zika virus outbreak earlier than traditional surveillance methods. In this paper,
    an overview of the ZikaHack competition is provided. The challenges and lessons
    learned in organizing this competition are also discussed for use by other researchers
    interested in organizing similar competitions.

  abstract: Biomedical Named Entity (NE) recognition is a core technique for various
    works in the biomedical domain. In previous studies, using machine learning algorithm
    shows better performance than dictionary-based and rule-based approaches because
    there are too many terminological variations of biomedical NEs and new biomedical
    NEs are constantly generated. To achieve the high performance with a machine-learning
    algorithm, good-quality corpora are required. However, it is difficult to obtain
    the good-quality corpora because an-notating a biomedical corpus for ma-chine-learning
    is extremely time-consuming and costly. In addition, most previous corpora are
    insufficient for high-level tasks because they cannot cover various domains. Therefore,
    we propose a method for generating a large amount of machine-labeled data that
    covers various domains. To generate a large amount of machine-labeled data, firstly
    we generate an initial machine-labeled data by using a chunker and MetaMap. The
    chunker is developed to extract only biomedical NEs with manually annotated data.
    MetaMap is used to annotate the category of bio-medical NE. Then we apply the
    self-training approach to bootstrap the performance of initial machine-labeled
    data. In our experiments, the biomedical NE recognition system that is trained
    with our proposed machine-labeled data achieves much high performance. As a result,
    our system outperforms biomedical NE recognition system that using MetaMap only
    with 26.03%p improvements on F1-score.

  abstract: The study of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is important in the drug discovering.
    Both PubMed and DrugBank are rich resources to retrieve DDI information which
    is usually represented in plain text. Automatically extracting DDI pairs from
    text improves the quality of drug discov-ering. In this paper, we presented a
    study that focuses on the DDI classification. We normalized the drug names, and
    developed both sentence-level and corpus-level features for DDI classification.
    A classifier ensemble approach is used for the unbalance DDI labels problem. Our
    approach achieved an F-score of 65.4% on SemEval 2013 DDI test set. The experimental
    results also show the effects of proposed corpus-level features in the DDI task.

  abstract: "In this work, we introduce a novel feature engineering approach named\
    \ \u201Calgebraic invariance\u201D to identify discriminative patterns for learning\
    \ relation pair features for the chemical-disease relation (CDR) task of BioCreative\
    \ V. Our method exploits the existing structural similarity of the key concepts\
    \ of relation descriptions from the CDR corpus to generate robust linguistic patterns\
    \ for SVM tree kernel-based learning. Preprocessing of the training data classifies\
    \ the entity pairs as either related or unrelated to build instance types for\
    \ both inter-sentential and intra-sentential scenarios. An invariant function\
    \ is proposed to process and optimally cluster similar patterns for both positive\
    \ and negative instances. The learning model for CDR pairs is based on the SVM\
    \ tree kernel approach, which generates feature trees and vectors and is modeled\
    \ on suitable invariance based patterns, bringing brevity, precision and context\
    \ to the identifier features. Results demonstrate that our method outperformed\
    \ other compared approaches, achieved a high recall rate of 85.08%, and averaged\
    \ an F1-score of 54.34% without the use of any additional knowledge bases."

    \ (NTUCLE) was developed based on that of the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE),\
    \ as well as marking rubrics used at NTU. After a description of the corpus, error\

    \ exercise as well as follow up actions. The final error tag set, which is significantly\
    \ larger than that for the NUCLE error categories, is then presented before a\

  abstract: Fill-in-the-blank items are a common form of exercise in computer-assisted
    language learning systems. To automatically generate an effective item, the system
    must be able to select a high-quality carrier sentence that illustrates the usage
    of the target word. Previous approaches for carrier sentence selection have considered
    sentence length, vocabulary difficulty, the position of the target word and the
    presence of finite verbs. This paper investigates the utility of word co-occurrence
    statistics and lexical similarity as selection criteria. In an evaluation on generating
    fill-in-the-blank items for learning Chinese as a foreign language, we show that
    these two criteria can improve carrier sentence quality.

  abstract: This paper provides an overview along with our findings of the Chinese
    Spelling Check shared task at NLPTEA 2017. The goal of this task is to develop
    a computer-assisted system to automatically diagnose typing errors in traditional
    Chinese sentences written by students. We defined six types of errors which belong
    to two categories. Given a sentence, the system should detect where the errors
    are, and for each detected error determine its type and provide correction suggestions.
    We designed, constructed, and released a benchmark dataset for this task.

  abstract: This paper presents a Chinese spelling check approach based on language
    models combined with string match algorithm to treat the problems resulted from
    the influence caused by Cantonese mother tone. N-grams first used to detecting
    the probability of sentence constructed by the writers, a string matching algorithm
    called Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm is used to detect and correct the error.
    According to the experimental results, the proposed approach can detect the error
    and provide the corresponding correction.

  abstract: Spelling errors occur frequently in educational settings, but their influence
    on automatic scoring is largely unknown. We therefore investigate the influence
    of spelling errors on content scoring performance using the example of the ASAP
    corpus. We conduct an annotation study on the nature of spelling errors in the
    ASAP dataset and utilize these finding in machine learning experiments that measure
    the influence of spelling errors on automatic content scoring. Our main finding
    is that scoring methods using both token and character n-gram features are robust
    against spelling errors up to the error frequency in ASAP.

  abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging and chunking have been used in tasks targeting
    learner English; however, to the best our knowledge, few studies have evaluated
    their performance and no studies have revealed the causes of POS-tagging/chunking
    errors in detail. Therefore, we investigate performance and analyze the causes
    of failure. We focus on spelling errors that occur frequently in learner English.
    We demonstrate that spelling errors reduced POS-tagging performance by 0.23% owing
    to spelling errors, and that a spell checker is not necessary for POS-tagging/chunking
    of learner English.

  abstract: This paper revisits the problem of complex word identification (CWI) following
    up the SemEval CWI shared task. We use ensemble classifiers to investigate how
    well computational methods can discriminate between complex and non-complex words.
    Furthermore, we analyze the classification performance to understand what makes
    lexical complexity challenging. Our findings show that most systems performed
    poorly on the SemEval CWI dataset, and one of the reasons for that is the way
    in which human annotation was performed.

  abstract: Sentence retrieval is an important NLP application for English as a Second
    Language (ESL) learners. ESL learners are familiar with web search engines, but
    generic web search results may not be adequate for composing documents in a specific
    domain. However, if we build our own search system specialized to a domain, it
    may be subject to the data sparseness problem. Recently proposed word2vec partially
    addresses the data sparseness problem, but fails to extract sentences relevant
    to queries owing to the modeling of the latent intent of the query. Thus, we propose
    a method of retrieving example sentences using kernel embeddings and N-gram windows.
    This method implicitly models latent intent of query and sentences, and alleviates
    the problem of noisy alignment. Our results show that our method achieved higher
    precision in sentence retrieval for ESL in the domain of a university press release
    corpus, as compared to a previous unsupervised method used for a semantic textual
    similarity task.

  abstract: Event timeline serves as the basic structure of history, and it is used
    as a disposition of key phenomena in studying history as a subject in secondary
    school. In order to enable a student to understand a historical phenomenon as
    a series of connected events, we present a system for automatic event timeline
    generation from history textbooks. Additionally, we propose Message Sequence Chart
    (MSC) and time-map based visualization techniques to visualize an event timeline.
    We also identify key computational challenges in developing natural language processing
    based applications for history textbooks.

  abstract: "For practical chatbots, one of the essential factor for improving user\
    \ experience is the capability of customizing the talking style of the agents,\
    \ that is, to make chatbots provide responses meeting users\u2019 preference on\
    \ language styles, topics, etc. To address this issue, this paper proposes to\
    \ incorporate linguistic biases, which implicitly involved in the conversation\
    \ corpora generated by human groups in the Social Network Services (SNS), into\
    \ the encoder-decoder based response generator. By attaching a specially designed\
    \ neural component to dynamically control the impact of linguistic biases in response\
    \ generation, a Group Linguistic Bias Aware Neural Response Generation (GLBA-NRG)\
    \ model is eventually presented. The experimental results on the dataset from\

    \ response generating models by producing both meaningful and vivid responses\

  abstract: For Chinese word segmentation, the large-scale annotated corpora mainly
    focus on newswire and only a handful of annotated data is available in other domains
    such as patents and literature. Considering the limited amount of annotated target
    domain data, it is a challenge for segmenters to learn domain-specific information
    while avoid getting over-fitted at the same time. In this paper, we propose a
    neural regularized domain adaptation method for Chinese word segmentation. The
    teacher networks trained in source domain are employed to regularize the training
    process of the student network by preserving the general knowledge. In the experiments,
    our neural regularized domain adaptation method achieves a better performance
    comparing to previous methods.

  abstract: Sub-character components of Chinese characters carry important semantic
    information, and recent studies have shown that utilizing this information can
    improve performance on core semantic tasks. In this paper, we hypothesize that
    in addition to semantic information, sub-character components may also carry emotional
    information, and that utilizing it should improve performance on sentiment analysis
    tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on four Chinese sentiment data sets
    and show that we can significantly improve the performance in various tasks over
    that of a character-level embeddings baseline. We then focus on qualitatively
    assessing multiple examples and trying to explain how the sub-character components
    affect the results in each case.

  abstract: Answer extraction is the most important part of a chinese web-based question
    answering system. In order to enhance the robustness and adaptability of answer
    extraction to new domains and eliminate the influence of the incomplete and noisy
    search snippets, we propose two new answer exraction methods. We utilize text
    patterns to generate Part-of-Speech (POS) patterns. In addition, a method is proposed
    to construct a POS tree by using these POS patterns. The POS tree is useful to
    candidate answer extraction of web-based question answering. To retrieve a efficient
    POS tree, the similarities between questions are used to select the question-answer
    pairs whose questions are similar to the unanswered question. Then, the POS tree
    is improved based on these question-answer pairs. In order to rank these candidate
    answers, the weights of the leaf nodes of the POS tree are calculated using a
    heuristic method. Moreover, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to train the weights.
    The experimental results of 10-fold crossvalidation show that the weighted POS
    tree trained by GA can improve the accuracy of answer extraction.

  abstract: "Terms extensively exist in specific domains, and term translation plays\
    \ a critical role in domain-specific machine translation (MT) tasks. However,\
    \ it\u2019s a challenging task to translate them correctly for the huge number\
    \ of pre-existing terms and the endless new terms. To achieve better term translation\
    \ quality, it is necessary to inject external term knowledge into the underlying\
    \ MT system. Fortunately, there are plenty of term translation knowledge in parenthetical\
    \ sentences on the Internet. In this paper, we propose a simple, straightforward\
    \ and effective framework to improve term translation by learning from parenthetical\
    \ sentences. This framework includes: (1) a focused web crawler; (2) a parenthetical\
    \ sentence filter, acquiring parenthetical sentences including bilingual term\
    \ pairs; (3) a term translation knowledge extractor, extracting bilingual term\
    \ translation candidates; (4) a probability learner, generating the term translation\
    \ table for MT decoders. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed\
    \ framework significantly improves the translation quality of terms and sentences."

  abstract: This paper presents a joint model for morphological and dependency analysis
    based on automatically acquired lexical knowledge. This model takes advantage
    of rich lexical knowledge to simultaneously resolve word segmentation, POS, and
    dependency ambiguities. In our experiments on Japanese, we show the effectiveness
    of our joint model over conventional pipeline models.

  abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to improve the accuracy of a strong
    transition-based dependency parser by exploiting dependency language models that
    are extracted from a large parsed corpus. We integrated a small number of features
    based on the dependency language models into the parser. To demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach, we evaluate our parser on standard English and Chinese
    data where the base parser could achieve competitive accuracy scores. Our enhanced
    parser achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on Chinese data and competitive results
    on English data. We gained a large absolute improvement of one point (UAS) on
    Chinese and 0.5 points for English.

  abstract: We present a systematic analysis of lexicalized vs. delexicalized parsing
    in low-resource scenarios, and propose a methodology to choose one method over
    another under certain conditions. We create a set of simulation experiments on
    41 languages and apply our findings to 9 low-resource languages. Experimental
    results show that our methodology chooses the best approach in 8 out of 9 cases.

  abstract: Neural part-of-speech tagging has achieved competitive results with the
    incorporation of character-based and pre-trained word embeddings. In this paper,
    we show that a state-of-the-art bi-LSTM tagger can benefit from using information
    from morphosyntactic lexicons as additional input. The tagger, trained on several
    dozen languages, shows a consistent, average improvement when using lexical information,
    even when also using character-based embeddings, thus showing the complementarity
    of the different sources of lexical information. The improvements are particularly
    important for the smaller datasets.

  abstract: We present a low-rank multi-linear model for the task of solving prepositional
    phrase attachment ambiguity (PP task). Our model exploits tensor products of word
    embeddings, capturing all possible conjunctions of latent embeddings. Our results
    on a wide range of datasets and task settings show that tensor products are the
    best compositional operation and that a relatively simple multi-linear model that
    uses only word embeddings of lexical features can outperform more complex non-linear
    architectures that exploit the same information. Our proposed model gives the
    current best reported performance on an out-of-domain evaluation and performs
    competively on out-of-domain dependency parsing datasets.

  abstract: This paper applies parsing technology to the task of syntactic simplification
    of English sentences, focusing on the identification of text spans that can be
    removed from a complex sentence. We report the most comprehensive evaluation to-date
    on this task, using a dataset of sentences that exhibit simplification based on
    coordination, subordination, punctuation/parataxis, adjectival clauses, participial
    phrases, and appositive phrases. We train a decision tree with features derived
    from text span length, POS tags and dependency relations, and show that it significantly
    outperforms a parser-only baseline.

  abstract: 'In applying word-based dependency parsing such as Universal Dependencies
    (UD) to Japanese, the uncertainty of word segmentation emerges for defining a
    word unit of the dependencies. We introduce the following hierarchical word structures
    to dependency parsing in Japanese: morphological units (a short unit word, SUW)
    and syntactic units (a long unit word, LUW). An SUW can be used to segment a sentence
    consistently, while it is too short to represent syntactic construction. An LUW
    is a unit including functional multiwords and LUW-based analysis facilitates the
    capturing of syntactic structure and makes parsing results more precise than SUW-based
    analysis. This paper describes the results of a feasibility study on the ability
    and the effectiveness of parsing methods based on hierarchical word structure
    (LUW chunking+parsing) in comparison to single layer word structure (SUW parsing).
    We also show joint analysis of LUW-chunking and dependency parsing improves the
    performance of identifying predicate-argument structures, while there is not much
    difference between overall results of them. not much difference between overall
    results of them.'

  abstract: We investigate the problem of parsing conversational data of morphologically-rich
    languages such as Hindi where argument scrambling occurs frequently. We evaluate
    a state-of-the-art non-linear transition-based parsing system on a new dataset
    containing 506 dependency trees for sentences from Bollywood (Hindi) movie scripts
    and Twitter posts of Hindi monolingual speakers. We show that a dependency parser
    trained on a newswire treebank is strongly biased towards the canonical structures
    and degrades when applied to conversational data. Inspired by Transformational
    Generative Grammar (Chomsky, 1965), we mitigate the sampling bias by generating
    all theoretically possible alternative word orders of a clause from the existing
    (kernel) structures in the treebank. Training our parser on canonical and transformed
    structures improves performance on conversational data by around 9% LAS over the
    baseline newswire parser.

  abstract: Deep dependency parsing can be cast as the search for maximum acyclic
    subgraphs in weighted digraphs. Because this search problem is intractable in
    the general case, we consider its restriction to the class of 1-endpoint-crossing
    (1ec) graphs, which has high coverage on standard data sets. Our main contribution
    is a characterization of 1ec graphs as a subclass of the graphs with pagenumber
    at most 3. Building on this we show how to extend an existing parsing algorithm
    for 1-endpoint-crossing trees to the full class. While the runtime complexity
    of the extended algorithm is polynomial in the length of the input sentence, it
    features a large constant, which poses a challenge for practical implementations.

  abstract: We present a new transition system with word reordering for unrestricted
    non-projective dependency parsing. Our system is based on decomposed arc-eager
    rather than arc-standard, which allows more flexible ambiguity resolution between
    a local projective and non-local crossing attachment. In our experiment on Universal
    Dependencies 2.0, we find our parser outperforms the ordinary swap-based parser
    particularly on languages with a large amount of non-projectivity.

  abstract: In this paper, we extend the arc-hybrid system for transition-based parsing
    with a swap transition that enables reordering of the words and construction of
    non-projective trees. Although this extension breaks the arc-decomposability of
    the transition system, we show how the existing dynamic oracle for this system
    can be modified and combined with a static oracle only for the swap transition.
    Experiments on 5 languages show that the new system gives competitive accuracy
    and is significantly better than a system trained with a purely static oracle.

  abstract: Encoder-decoder neural networks have been used for many NLP tasks, such
    as neural machine translation. They have also been applied to constituent parsing
    by using bracketed tree structures as a target language, translating input sentences
    into syntactic trees. A more commonly used method to linearize syntactic trees
    is the shift-reduce system, which uses a sequence of transition-actions to build
    trees. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of applying the encoder-decoder
    network to transition-based parsing. On standard benchmarks, our system gives
    comparable results to the stack LSTM parser for dependency parsing, and significantly
    better results compared to the aforementioned parser for constituent parsing,
    which uses bracketed tree formats.

  abstract: We present a neural transition-based parser for spinal trees, a dependency
    representation of constituent trees. The parser uses Stack-LSTMs that compose
    constituent nodes with dependency-based derivations. In experiments, we show that
    this model adapts to different styles of dependency relations, but this choice
    has little effect for predicting constituent structure, suggesting that LSTMs
    induce useful states by themselves.

  abstract: We generalize coarse-to-fine parsing to grammar formalisms that are more
    expressive than PCFGs and/or describe languages of trees or graphs. We evaluate
    our algorithm on PCFG, PTAG, and graph parsing. While we achieve the expected
    performance gains on PCFGs, coarse-to-fine does not help for PTAG and can even
    slow down parsing for graphs. We discuss the implications of this finding.

  abstract: To improve grammatical function labelling for German, we augment the labelling
    component of a neural dependency parser with a decision history. We present different
    ways to encode the history, using different LSTM architectures, and show that
    our models yield significant improvements, resulting in a LAS for German that
    is close to the best result from the SPMRL 2014 shared task (without the reranker).

  abstract: "The field of automated deception detection in written texts is methodologically\
    \ challenging. Different linguistic levels (lexics, syntax and semantics) are\
    \ basically used for different types of English texts to reveal if they are truthful\
    \ or deceptive. Such parameters as POS tags and POS tags n-grams, punctuation\
    \ marks, sentiment polarity of words, psycholinguistic features, fragments of\
    \ synta\u0441tic structures are taken into consideration. The importance of different\
    \ types of parameters was not compared for the Russian language before and should\
    \ be investigated before moving to complex models and higher levels of linguistic\
    \ processing. On the example of the Russian Deception Bank Corpus we estimate\
    \ the impact of three groups of features (POS features including bigrams, sentiment\
    \ and psycholinguistic features, syntax and readability features) on the successful\
    \ deception detection and find out that POS features can be used for binary text\
    \ classification, but the results should be double-checked and, if possible, improved."

  abstract: Understanding questions and answers in QA system is a major challenge
    in the domain of natural language processing. In this paper, we present a question
    answering system that influences the human opinions in a conversation. The opinion
    words are quantified by using a lexicon-based method. We apply Latent Semantic
    Analysis and the cosine similarity measure between candidate answers and each
    question to infer the answer of the chatbot.

  abstract: Debate summarization is one of the novel and challenging research areas
    in automatic text summarization which has been largely unexplored. In this paper,
    we develop a debate summarization pipeline to summarize key topics which are discussed
    or argued in the two opposing sides of online debates. We view that the generation
    of debate summaries can be achieved by clustering, cluster labeling, and visualization.
    In our work, we investigate two different clustering approaches for the generation
    of the summaries. In the first approach, we generate the summaries by applying
    purely term-based clustering and cluster labeling. The second approach makes use
    of X-means for clustering and Mutual Information for labeling the clusters. Both
    approaches are driven by ontologies. We visualize the results using bar charts.
    We think that our results are a smooth entry for users aiming to receive the first
    impression about what is discussed within a debate topic containing waste number
    of argumentations.

  abstract: Speech therapists and researchers are becoming more concerned with the
    use of computer-based systems in the therapy of speech disorders. In this paper,
    we propose a computer-based game with a purpose (GWAP) for speech therapy of Egyptian
    speaking children suffering from Dyslalia. Our aim is to detect if a certain phoneme
    is pronounced correctly. An Egyptian Arabic speech corpus has been collected.
    A baseline acoustic model was trained using the Egyptian corpus. In order to benefit
    from existing large amounts of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) resources, MSA acoustic
    models were adapted with the collected Egyptian corpus. An independent testing
    set that covers common speech disorders has been collected for Egyptian speakers.
    Results show that adapted acoustic models give better recognition accuracy which
    could be relied on in the game and that children show more interest in playing
    the game than in visiting the therapist. A noticeable progress in children Dyslalia
    appeared with the proposed system.

  abstract: "In this paper we present a semantic enrichment approach for linking two\
    \ distinct data sets: the \xD6BL (Austrian Biographical Dictionary) and the DB\xD6\
    \ (Database of Bavarian Dialects in Austria). Although the data sets are different\
    \ in their content and in the structuring of data, they contain similar common\
    \ \u201Centities\u201D such as names of persons. Here we describe the semantic\
    \ enrichment process of how these data sets can be inter-linked through URIs (Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifiers) taking person names as a concrete example. Moreover, we\
    \ also point to societal benefits of applying such semantic enrichment methods\
    \ in order to open and connect our resources to various services."

  abstract: 'The UAIC-RoDia-DepTb is a balanced treebank, containing texts in non-standard
    language: 2,575 chats sentences, old Romanian texts (a Gospel printed in 1648,
    a codex of laws printed in 1818, a novel written in 1910), regional popular poetry,
    legal texts, Romanian and foreign fiction, quotations. The proportions are comparable;
    each of these types of texts is represented by subsets of at least 1,000 phrases,
    so that the parser can be trained on their peculiarities. The annotation of the
    treebank started in 2007, and it has classical tags, such as those in school grammar,
    with the intention of using the resource for didactic purposes. The classification
    of circumstantial modifiers is rich in semantic information. We present in this
    paper the development in progress of this resource which has been automatically
    annotated and entirely manually corrected. We try to add new texts, and to make
    it available in more formats, by keeping all the morphological and syntactic information
    annotated, and adding logical-semantic information. We will describe here two
    conversions, from the classic syntactic format into Universal Dependencies format
    and into a logical-semantic layer, which will be shortly presented.'

  abstract: When people or organizations provide information, they make choices regarding
    what information they include and how they present it. The combination of these
    two aspects (the content and stance provided by the source) represents a perspective.
    Investigating differences in perspective can provide various useful insights in
    the reliability of information, the way perspectives change over time, shared
    beliefs among groups of a similar social or political background and contrasts
    between other groups, etc. This paper introduces GRaSP, a generic framework for
    modeling perspectives and their sources.

  abstract: "The use of parameters in the description of natural language syntax has\
    \ to balance between the need to discriminate among (sometimes subtly different)\
    \ languages, which can be seen as a cross-linguistic version of Chomsky\u2019\
    s (1964) descriptive adequacy, and the complexity of the acquisition task that\
    \ a large number of parameters would imply, which is a problem for explanatory\
    \ adequacy. Here we present a novel approach in which a machine learning algorithm\
    \ is used to find dependencies in a table of parameters. The result is a dependency\
    \ graph in which some of the parameters can be fully predicted from others. These\
    \ empirical findings can be then subjected to linguistic analysis, which may either\
    \ refute them by providing typological counter-examples of languages not included\
    \ in the original dataset, dismiss them on theoretical grounds, or uphold them\
    \ as tentative empirical laws worth of further study."

  abstract: This paper describes an approach to translating course unit descriptions
    from Italian and German into English, using a phrase-based machine translation
    (MT) system. The genre is very prominent among those requiring translation by
    universities in European countries in which English is a non-native language.
    For each language combination, an in-domain bilingual corpus including course
    unit and degree program descriptions is used to train an MT engine, whose output
    is then compared to a baseline engine trained on the Europarl corpus. In a subsequent
    experiment, a bilingual terminology database is added to the training sets in
    both engines and its impact on the output quality is evaluated based on BLEU and
    post-editing score. Results suggest that the use of domain-specific corpora boosts
    the engines quality for both language combinations, especially for German-English,
    whereas adding terminological resources does not seem to bring notable benefits.

  abstract: Market pressure on translation productivity joined with technological
    innovation is likely to fragment and decontextualise translation jobs even more
    than is cur-rently the case. Many different translators increasingly work on one
    document at different places, collaboratively working in the cloud. This paper
    investigates the effect of decontextualised source texts on behaviour by comparing
    post-editing of sequentially ordered sentences with shuffled sentences from two
    different texts. The findings suggest that there is little or no effect of the
    decontextualised source texts on behaviour.

  abstract: As machine translation technology improves comparisons to human performance
    are often made in quite general and exaggerated terms. Thus, it is important to
    be able to account for differences accurately. This paper reports a simple, descriptive
    scheme for comparing translations and applies it to two translations of a British
    opinion article published in March, 2017. One is a human translation (HT) into
    Swedish, and the other a machine translation (MT). While the comparison is limited
    to one text, the results are indicative of current limitations in MT.

  abstract: Despite the growing importance of data in translation, there is no data
    repository that equally meets the requirements of translation industry and academia
    alike. Therefore, we plan to develop a freely available, multilingual and expandable
    bank of translations and their source texts aligned at the sentence level. Special
    emphasis will be placed on the labelling of metadata that precisely describe the
    relations between translated texts and their originals. This metadata-centric
    approach gives users the opportunity to compile and download custom corpora on
    demand. Such a general-purpose data repository may help to bridge the gap between
    translation theory and the language industry, including translation technology
    providers and NLP.

  abstract: 'With the aim to teach our automatic speech-to-text translation system
    human interpreting strategies, our first step is to identify which interpreting
    strategies are most often used in the language pair of our interest (English-Arabic).
    In this article we run an automatic analysis of a corpus of parallel speeches
    and their human interpretations, and provide the results of manually annotating
    the human interpreting strategies in a sample of the corpus. We give a glimpse
    of the corpus, whose value surpasses the fact that it contains a high number of
    scientific speeches with their interpretations from English into Arabic, as it
    also provides rich information about the interpreters. We also discuss the difficulties,
    which we encountered on our way, as well as our solutions to them: our methodology
    for manual re-segmentation and alignment of parallel segments, the choice of annotation
    tool, and the annotation procedure. Our annotation findings explain the previously
    extracted specific statistical features of the interpreted corpus (compared with
    a translation one) as well as the quality of interpretation provided by different
    interpreters.'

  abstract: The TM memory systems changed the work of translators and now the translators
    not benefiting from these tools are a tiny minority. These tools operate on fuzzy
    (surface) matching mostly and cannot benefit from already translated texts which
    are synonymous to (or paraphrased versions of) the text to be translated. The
    match score is mostly based on character-string similarity, calculated through
    Levenshtein distance. The TM tools have difficulties with detecting similarities
    even in sentences which represent a minor revision of sentences already available
    in the translation memory. This shortcoming of the current TM systems was the
    subject of the present study and was empirically proven in the experiments we
    conducted. To this end, we compiled a small translation memory (English-Spanish)
    and applied several lexical and syntactic transformation rules to the source sentences
    with both English and Spanish being the source language. The results of this study
    show that current TM systems have a long way to go and highlight the need for
    TM systems equipped with NLP capabilities which will offer the translator the
    advantage of he/she not having to translate a sentence again if an almost identical
    sentence has already been already translated.

  abstract: The aim of this research is to identify local Arabic dialects in texts
    from social media (Twitter) and link them to specific geographic areas. Dialect
    identification is studied as a subset of the task of language identification.
    The proposed method is based on unsupervised learning using simultaneously lexical
    and geographic distance. While this study focusses on Libyan dialects, the approach
    is general, and could produce resources to support human translators and interpreters
    when dealing with vernaculars rather than standard Arabic.

  abstract: Whenever employed on large datasets, information retrieval works by isolating
    a subset of documents from the larger dataset and then proceeding with low-level
    processing of the text. This is usually carried out by means of adding index-terms
    to each document in the collection. In this paper we deal with automatic document
    classification and index-term detection applied on large-scale medical corpora.
    In our methodology we employ a linear classifier and we test our results on the
    BioASQ training corpora, which is a collection of 12 million MeSH-indexed medical
    abstracts. We cover both term-indexing, result retrieval and result ranking based
    on distributed word representations.

  abstract: We consider the problem of populating multi-part knowledge frames from
    textual information distributed over multiple sentences in a document. We present
    a corpus constructed by aligning papers from the cellular signaling literature
    to a collection of approximately 50,000 reference frames curated by hand as part
    of a decade-long project. We present and evaluate two approaches to the challenging
    problem of reconstructing these frames, which formalize biological assays described
    in the literature. One approach is based on classifying candidate records nominated
    by sentence-local entity co-occurrence. In the second approach, we introduce a
    novel virtual register machine traverses an article and generates frames, trained
    on our reference data. Our evaluations show that success in the task ultimately
    hinges on an integration of evidence spread across the discourse.

  abstract: The robust extraction of numeric values from clinical narratives is a
    well known problem in clinical data warehouses. In this paper we describe a dynamic
    and domain-independent approach to deliver numerical described values from clinical
    narratives. In contrast to alternative systems, we neither use manual defined
    rules nor any kind of ontologies or nomenclatures. Instead we propose a topic-based
    system, that tackles the information extraction as a text classification problem.
    Hence we use machine learning to identify the crucial context features of a topic-specific
    numeric value by a given set of example sentences, so that the manual effort reduces
    to the selection of appropriate sample sentences. We describe context features
    of a certain numeric value by term frequency vectors which are generated by multiple
    document segmentation procedures. Due to this simultaneous segmentation approaches,
    there can be more than one context vector for a numeric value. In those cases,
    we choose the context vector with the highest classification confidence and suppress
    the rest. To test our approach, we used a dataset from a german hospital containing
    12,743 narrative reports about laboratory results of Leukemia patients. We used
    Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and achieved an average accuracy
    of 96% on a manually labeled subset of 2073 documents, using 10-fold cross validation.
    This is a significant improvement over an alternative rule based system.

  abstract: 'We assume that unknown words with internal structure (affixed words or
    compounds) can provide speakers with linguistic cues as for their meaning, and
    thus help their decoding and understanding. To verify this hypothesis, we propose
    to work with a set of French medical words. These words are annotated by five
    annotators. Then, two kinds of analysis are performed: analysis of the evolution
    of understandable and non-understandable words (globally and according to some
    suffixes) and analysis of clusters created with unsupervised algorithms on basis
    of linguistic and extra-linguistic features of the studied words. Our results
    suggest that, according to linguistic sensitivity of annotators, technical words
    can be decoded and become understandable. As for the clusters, some of them distinguish
    between understandable and non-understandable words. Resources built in this work
    will be made freely available for the research purposes.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the concept of entity-centric information
    access for the biomedical domain. With entity recognition technologies approaching
    acceptable levels of accuracy, we put forward a paradigm of document browsing
    and searching where the entities of the domain and their relations are explicitly
    modeled to provide users the possibility of collecting exhaustive information
    on relations of interest. We describe three working prototypes along these lines:
    NEW/S/LEAK, which was developed for investigative journalists who need a quick
    overview of large leaked document collections; STORYFINDER, which is a personalized
    organizer for information found in web pages that allows adding entities as well
    as relations, and is capable of personalized information management; and adaptive
    annotation capabilities of WEBANNO, which is a general-purpose linguistic annotation
    tool. We will discuss future steps towards the adaptation of these tools to biomedical
    data, which is subject to a recently started project on biomedical knowledge acquisition.
    A key difference to other approaches is the centering around the user in a Human-in-the-Loop
    machine learning approach, where users define and extend categories and enable
    the system to improve via feedback and interaction.'

  abstract: "We explored a new approach to named entity recognition based on hundreds\
    \ of machine learning models, each trained to distinguish a single entity, and\
    \ showed its application to gene name identification (GNI). The rationale for\
    \ our approach, which we named \u201Cone model per entity\u201D (OMPE), was that\
    \ increasing the number of models would make the learning task easier for each\
    \ individual model. Our training strategy leveraged freely-available database\
    \ annotations instead of manually-annotated corpora. While its performance in\
    \ our proof-of-concept was disappointing, we believe that there is enough room\
    \ for improvement that such approaches could reach competitive performance while\
    \ eliminating the cost of creating costly training corpora."

  abstract: Systems which build on top of information extraction are typically challenged
    to extract knowledge that, while correct, is not yet well-known. We hypothesize
    that a good confidence measure for relational information has the property that
    such interesting information is found between information extracted with very
    high confidence and very low confidence. We discuss confidence estimation for
    the domain of biomedical protein-protein relation discovery in biomedical literature.
    As facts reported in papers take some time to be validated and recorded in biomedical
    databases, such task gives rise to large quantities of unknown but potentially
    true candidate relations. It is thus important to rank them based on supporting
    evidence rather than discard them. In this paper, we discuss this task and propose
    different approaches for confidence estimation and a pipeline to evaluate such
    methods. We show that the most straight-forward approach, a combination of different
    confidence measures from pipeline modules seems not to work well. We discuss this
    negative result and pinpoint potential future research directions.

  abstract: We describe a method which extracts Association Rules from texts in order
    to recognise verbalisations of risk factors. Usually some basic vocabulary about
    risk factors is known but medical conditions are expressed in clinical narratives
    with much higher variety. We propose an approach for data-driven learning of specialised
    medical vocabulary which, once collected, enables early alerting of potentially
    affected patients. The method is illustrated by experimens with clinical records
    of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and comorbidity
    of CORD, Diabetes Melitus and Schizophrenia. Our input data come from the Bulgarian
    Diabetic Register, which is built using a pseudonymised collection of outpatient
    records for about 500,000 diabetic patients. The generated Association Rules for
    CORD are analysed in the context of demographic, gender, and age information.
    Valuable anounts of meaningful words, signalling risk factors, are discovered
    with high precision and confidence.

  abstract: When patients take more than one medication, they may be at risk of drug
    interactions, which means that a given drug can cause unexpected effects when
    taken in combination with other drugs. Similar effects may occur when drugs are
    taken together with some food or beverages. For instance, grapefruit has interactions
    with several drugs, because its active ingredients inhibit enzymes involved in
    the drugs metabolism and can then cause an excessive dosage of these drugs. Yet,
    information on food/drug interactions is poorly researched. The current research
    is mainly provided by the medical domain and a very tentative work is provided
    by computer sciences and NLP domains. One factor that motivates the research is
    related to the availability of the annotated corpora and the reference data. The
    purpose of our work is to describe the rationale and approach for creation and
    annotation of scientific corpus with information on food/drug interactions. This
    corpus contains 639 MEDLINE citations (titles and abstracts), corresponding to
    5,752 sentences. It is manually annotated by two experts. The corpus is named
    POMELO. This annotated corpus will be made available for the research purposes.

  abstract: "This paper describes a Romanian Dependency Treebank, built at the Al.\
    \ I. Cuza University (UAIC), and a special OCR techniques used to build it. The\
    \ corpus has rich morphological and syntactic annotation. There are few annotated\
    \ representative corpora in Romanian, and the existent ones are mainly focused\
    \ on the contemporary Romanian standard. The corpus described below is focused\
    \ on the non-standard aspects of the language, the Regional and the Old Romanian.\
    \ Having the intention to participate at the PROIEL project, which aligns oldest\
    \ New Testaments, we annotate the first printed Romanian New Testament (Alba Iulia,\
    \ 1648). We began by applying the UAIC tools for the morphological and syntactic\
    \ processing of Contemporary Romanian over the book\u2019s first quarter (second\
    \ edition). By carefully manually correcting the result of the automated annotation\
    \ (having a modest accuracy) we obtained a sub-corpus for the training of tools\
    \ for the Old Romanian processing. But the first edition of the New Testament\
    \ is written in Cyrillic letters. The existence of books printed in the Old Cyrillic\
    \ alphabet is a common problem for Romania and The Republic of Moldova, countries\
    \ where the Romanian is spoken; a problem to solve by the joint efforts of the\
    \ NLP researchers in the two countries."

  abstract: Contemporary standard language corpora are ideal for NLP. There are few
    morphologically and syntactically annotated corpora for Romanian, and those existing
    or in progress only deal with the Contemporary Romanian standard. However, the
    necessity to study the dynamics of natural languages gave rise to balanced corpora,
    containing non-standard texts. In this paper, we describe the creation of tools
    for processing non-standard Romanian to build a big balanced corpus. We want to
    preserve in annotated form as many early stages of language as possible. We have
    already built a corpus in Old Romanian. We also intend to include the South-Danube
    dialects, remote to the standard language, along with regional forms closer to
    the standard. We try to preserve data about endangered idioms such as Aromanian,
    Meglenoromanian and Istroromanian dialects, and calculate the distance between
    different regional variants, including the language spoken in the Republic of
    Moldova. This distance, as well as the mutual understanding between the speakers,
    is the correct criterion for the classification of idioms as different languages,
    or as dialects, or as regional variants close to the standard.

  abstract: "We describe work done in the field of folkloristics and consisting in\
    \ creating ontologies based on well-established studies proposed by \u201Cclassical\u201D\
    \ folklorists. This work is supporting the availability of a huge amount of digital\
    \ and structured knowledge on folktales to digital humanists. The ontological\
    \ encoding of past and current motif-indexation and classification systems for\
    \ folktales was in the first step limited to English language data. This led us\
    \ to focus on making those newly generated formal knowledge sources available\
    \ in a few more languages, like German, Russian and Bulgarian. We stress the importance\
    \ of achieving this multilingual extension of our ontologies at a larger scale,\
    \ in order for example to support the automated analysis and classification of\
    \ such narratives in a large variety of languages, as those are getting more and\
    \ more accessible on the Web."

  abstract: 'Current approaches in Digital .Humanities tend to ignore a central as-pect
    of any hermeneutic introspection: the intrinsic vagueness of analyzed texts. Especially
    when dealing with his-torical documents neglecting vague-ness has important implications
    on the interpretation of the results. In this pa-per we present current limitation
    of an-notation approaches and describe a current methodology for annotating vagueness
    for historical Romanian texts.'

  abstract: 'The NBU Language Teaching Platform (PLT) was initially designed for teaching
    foreign languages for specific purposes; at a second stage, some of its functionalities
    were extended to answer the needs of teaching general foreign language. New functionalities
    have now been created for the purpose of providing e-support for Bulgarian language
    and literature teaching at primary and secondary school level. The article presents
    the general structure of the platform and the functionalities specifically developed
    to match the standards and expected results set by the Ministry of Education.
    The E-platform integrates: 1/ an environment for creating, organizing and maintaining
    electronic text archives, for extracting text corpora and aligning corpora; 2/
    a linguistic database; 3/ a concordancer; 4/ a set of modules for the generation
    and editing of practice exercises for each text or corpus; 5/ functionalities
    for export from the platform and import to other educational platforms. For Moodle,
    modules were created for test generation, performance assessment and feedback.
    The PLT allows centralized presentation of abundant teaching content, control
    of the educational process, fast and reliable feedback on performance.'
