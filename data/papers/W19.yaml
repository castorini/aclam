  abstract: Temporal notions based on a finite set A of properties are represented
    in strings, on which projections are defined that vary the granularity A. The
    structure of properties in A is elaborated to describe statives, events and actions,
    subject to a distinction in meaning (advocated by Levin and Rappaport Hovav) between
    what the lexicon prescribes and what a context of use supplies. The projections
    proposed are deployed as labels for records and record types amenable to finite-state
    methods.

  abstract: 'A growing interest in tasks involving language understanding by the NLP
    community has led to the need for effective semantic parsing and inference. Modern
    NLP systems use semantic representations that do not quite fulfill the nuanced
    needs for language understanding: adequately modeling language semantics, enabling
    general inferences, and being accurately recoverable. This document describes
    underspecified logical forms (ULF) for Episodic Logic (EL), which is an initial
    form for a semantic representation that balances these needs. ULFs fully resolve
    the semantic type structure while leaving issues such as quantifier scope, word
    sense, and anaphora unresolved; they provide a starting point for further resolution
    into EL, and enable certain structural inferences without further resolution.
    This document also presents preliminary results of creating a hand-annotated corpus
    of ULFs for the purpose of training a precise ULF parser, showing a three-person
    pairwise interannotator agreement of 0.88 on confident annotations. We hypothesize
    that a divide-and-conquer approach to semantic parsing starting with derivation
    of ULFs will lead to semantic analyses that do justice to subtle aspects of linguistic
    meaning, and will enable construction of more accurate semantic parsers.'

    \ syntax which defines \u2018annotation structures\u2019 as triples and other\

  abstract: Topics models, such as LDA, are widely used in Natural Language Processing.
    Making their output interpretable is an important area of research with applications
    to areas such as the enhancement of exploratory search interfaces and the development
    of interpretable machine learning models. Conventionally, topics are represented
    by their n most probable words, however, these representations are often difficult
    for humans to interpret. This paper explores the re-ranking of topic words to
    generate more interpretable topic representations. A range of approaches are compared
    and evaluated in two experiments. The first uses crowdworkers to associate topics
    represented by different word rankings with related documents. The second experiment
    is an automatic approach based on a document retrieval task applied on multiple
    domains. Results in both experiments demonstrate that re-ranking words improves
    topic interpretability and that the most effective re-ranking schemes were those
    which combine information about the importance of words both within topics and
    their relative frequency in the entire corpus. In addition, close correlation
    between the results of the two evaluation approaches suggests that the automatic
    method proposed here could be used to evaluate re-ranking methods without the
    need for human judgements.

  abstract: 'This paper builds on previous work using Combinatory Categorial Grammar
    (CCG) to derive a transparent syntax-semantics interface for Abstract Meaning
    Representation (AMR) parsing. We define new semantics for the CCG combinators
    that is better suited to deriving AMR graphs. In particular, we define relation-wise
    alternatives for the application and composition combinators: these require that
    the two constituents being combined overlap in one AMR relation. We also provide
    a new semantics for type raising, which is necessary for certain constructions.
    Using these mechanisms, we suggest an analysis of eventive nouns, which present
    a challenge for deriving AMR graphs. Our theoretical analysis will facilitate
    future work on robust and transparent AMR parsing using CCG.'

  abstract: "This paper presents a semantic annotation scheme for Danish adjectives,\
    \ focusing both on prototypical semantic content and semantic collocational restrictions\
    \ on an adjective\u2019s head noun. The core type set comprises about 110 categories\
    \ ordered in a shallow hierarchy with 14 primary and 25 secondary umbrella categories.\
    \ In addition, domain information and binary sentiment tags are provided, as well\
    \ as VerbNet-derived frames and semantic roles for those adjectives governing\
    \ arguments. The scheme has been almost fully implemented on the lexicon of the\
    \ Danish VISL parser, DanGram, containing 14,000 adjectives. We discuss the annotation\
    \ scheme and its applicational perspectives, and present a statistical breakdown\
    \ and coverage evaluation for three Danish reference corpora."

  abstract: "Complex predicates formed of a semantically \u2018light\u2019 verbal\
    \ head and a noun or verb which contributes the major part of the meaning are\
    \ frequently referred to as \u2018light verb constructions\u2019 (LVCs). In the\
    \ paper, we present a case study of LVCs with the German posture verb stehen \u2018\
    stand\u2019. In our account, we model the syntactic as well as semantic composition\
    \ of such LVCs by combining Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) with frames.\
    \ Starting from the analysis of the literal uses of posture verbs, we show how\
    \ the meaning components of the literal uses are systematically exploited in the\
    \ interpretation of stehen-LVCs. The paper constitutes an important step towards\
    \ a compositional and computational analysis of LVCs. We show that LTAG allows\
    \ us to separate constructional from lexical meaning components and that frames\
    \ enable elegant generalizations over event types and related constraints."

  abstract: Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) construct vector representations
    of word meanings based on their contexts. Typically, the contexts of a word are
    defined as its closest neighbours, but they can also be retrieved from its syntactic
    dependency relations. In this work, we propose a new dependency-based DSM. The
    novelty of our model lies in associating an independent meaning representation,
    a matrix, with each dependency-label. This allows it to capture specifics of the
    relations between words and contexts, leading to good performance on both intrinsic
    and extrinsic evaluation tasks. In addition to that, our model has an inherent
    ability to represent dependency chains as products of matrices which provides
    a straightforward way of handling further contexts of a word.

  abstract: "Inferences regarding \u201CJane\u2019s arrival in London\u201D from predications\
    \ such as \u201CJane is going to London\u201D or \u201CJane has gone to London\u201D\
    \ depend on tense and aspect of the predications. Tense determines the temporal\
    \ location of the predication in the past, present or future of the time of utterance.\
    \ The aspectual auxiliaries on the other hand specify the internal constituency\

    \ and whether its consequences hold at that time or not. While tense and aspect\
    \ are among the most important factors for determining natural language inference,\
    \ there has been very little work to show whether modern embedding models capture\
    \ these semantic concepts. In this paper we propose a novel entailment dataset\
    \ and analyse the ability of contextualised word representations to perform inference\
    \ on predications across aspectual types and tenses. We show that they encode\
    \ a substantial amount of information relating to tense and aspect, but fail to\
    \ consistently model inferences that require reasoning with these semantic properties."

  abstract: 'Distributional semantics has had enormous empirical success in Computational
    Linguistics and Cognitive Science in modeling various semantic phenomena, such
    as semantic similarity, and distributional models are widely used in state-of-the-art
    Natural Language Processing systems. However, the theoretical status of distributional
    semantics within a broader theory of language and cognition is still unclear:
    What does distributional semantics model? Can it be, on its own, a fully adequate
    model of the meanings of linguistic expressions? The standard answer is that distributional
    semantics is not fully adequate in this regard, because it falls short on some
    of the central aspects of formal semantic approaches: truth conditions, entailment,
    reference, and certain aspects of compositionality. We argue that this standard
    answer rests on a misconception: These aspects do not belong in a theory of expression
    meaning, they are instead aspects of speaker meaning, i.e., communicative intentions
    in a particular context. In a slogan: words do not refer, speakers do. Clearing
    this up enables us to argue that distributional semantics on its own is an adequate
    model of expression meaning. Our proposal sheds light on the role of distributional
    semantics in a broader theory of language and cognition, its relationship to formal
    semantics, and its place in computational models.'

  abstract: Open Information Extraction (Open IE) aims at generating entity-relation-entity
    triples from a large amount of text, aiming at capturing key semantics of the
    text. Given a triple, the relation expresses the type of semantic relation between
    the entities. Although relations from an Open IE system are more extensible than
    those used in a traditional Information Extraction system and a Knowledge Base
    (KB) such as Knowledge Graphs, the former lacks in semantics; an Open IE relation
    is simply a sequence of words, whereas a KB relation has a predefined meaning.
    As a way to provide a meaning to an Open IE relation, we attempt to align it with
    one of the predefined set of relations used in a KB. Our approach is to use a
    Siamese network that compares two sequences of word embeddings representing an
    Open IE relation and a predefined KB relation. In order to make the approach practical,
    we automatically generate a training dataset using a distant supervision approach
    instead of relying on a hand-labeled dataset. Our experiment shows that the proposed
    method can capture the relational semantics better than the recent approaches.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a language-agnostic deep neural network architecture
    for aspect-based sentiment analysis. The proposed approach is based on Bidirectional
    Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network, which is further assisted with extra
    hand-crafted features. We define three different architectures for the successful
    combination of word embeddings and hand-crafted features. We evaluate the proposed
    approach for six languages (i.e. English, Spanish, French, Dutch, German and Hindi)
    and two problems (i.e. aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification).
    Experiments show that the proposed model attains state-of-the-art performance
    in most of the settings.

  abstract: Concreteness of words has been studied extensively in psycholinguistic
    literature. A number of datasets have been created with average values for perceived
    concreteness of words. We show that we can train a regression model on these data,
    using word embeddings and morphological features, that can predict these concreteness
    values with high accuracy. We evaluate the model on 7 publicly available datasets.
    Only for a few small subsets of these datasets prediction of concreteness values
    are found in the literature. Our results clearly outperform the reported results
    for these datasets.

  abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is one of the most difficult
    steps in discourse parsing. The difficulty stems from the fact that the coherence
    relation must be inferred based on the content of the discourse relational arguments.
    Therefore, an effective encoding of the relational arguments is of crucial importance.
    We here propose a new model for implicit discourse relation classification, which
    consists of a classifier, and a sequence-to-sequence model which is trained to
    generate a representation of the discourse relational arguments by trying to predict
    the relational arguments including a suitable implicit connective. Training is
    possible because such implicit connectives have been annotated as part of the
    PDTB corpus. Along with a memory network, our model could generate more refined
    representations for the task. And on the now standard 11-way classification, our
    method outperforms the previous state of the art systems on the PDTB benchmark
    on multiple settings including cross validation.

  abstract: We describe a transfer method based on annotation projection to develop
    a dependency-based semantic role labeling system for languages for which no supervised
    linguistic information other than parallel data is available. Unlike previous
    work that presumes the availability of supervised features such as lemmas, part-of-speech
    tags, and dependency parse trees, we only make use of word and character features.
    Our deep model considers using character-based representations as well as unsupervised
    stem embeddings to alleviate the need for supervised features. Our experiments
    outperform a state-of-the-art method that uses supervised lexico-syntactic features
    on 6 out of 7 languages in the Universal Proposition Bank.

  abstract: "The multimodal models used in the emerging field at the intersection\
    \ of computational linguistics and computer vision implement the bottom-up processing\
    \ of the \u201CHub and Spoke\u201D architecture proposed in cognitive science\
    \ to represent how the brain processes and combines multi-sensory inputs. In particular,\
    \ the Hub is implemented as a neural network encoder. We investigate the effect\
    \ on this encoder of various vision-and-language tasks proposed in the literature:\
    \ visual question answering, visual reference resolution, and visually grounded\
    \ dialogue. To measure the quality of the representations learned by the encoder,\
    \ we use two kinds of analyses. First, we evaluate the encoder pre-trained on\
    \ the different vision-and-language tasks on an existing \u201Cdiagnostic task\u201D\
    \ designed to assess multimodal semantic understanding. Second, we carry out a\
    \ battery of analyses aimed at studying how the encoder merges and exploits the\
    \ two modalities."

  abstract: 'Learning to follow human instructions is a long-pursued goal in artificial
    intelligence. The task becomes particularly challenging if no prior knowledge
    of the employed language is assumed while relying only on a handful of examples
    to learn from. Work in the past has relied on hand-coded components or manually
    engineered features to provide strong inductive biases that make learning in such
    situations possible. In contrast, here we seek to establish whether this knowledge
    can be acquired automatically by a neural network system through a two phase training
    procedure: A (slow) offline learning stage where the network learns about the
    general structure of the task and a (fast) online adaptation phase where the network
    learns the language of a new given speaker. Controlled experiments show that when
    the network is exposed to familiar instructions but containing novel words, the
    model adapts very efficiently to the new vocabulary. Moreover, even for human
    speakers whose language usage can depart significantly from our artificial training
    language, our network can still make use of its automatically acquired inductive
    bias to learn to follow instructions more effectively.'

  abstract: The embedding of words and documents in compact, semantically meaningful
    vector spaces is a crucial part of modern information systems. Deep Learning models
    are powerful but their hyperparameter selection is often complex and they are
    expensive to train, and while pre-trained models are available, embeddings trained
    on general corpora are not necessarily well-suited to domain specific tasks. We
    propose a novel embedding method which extends random projection by weighting
    and projecting raw term embeddings orthogonally to an average language vector,
    thus improving the discriminating power of resulting term embeddings, and build
    more meaningful document embeddings by assigning appropriate weights to individual
    terms. We describe how updating the term embeddings online as we process the training
    data results in an extremely efficient method, in terms of both computational
    and memory requirements. Our experiments show highly competitive results with
    various state-of-the-art embedding methods on different tasks, including the standard
    STS benchmark and a subject prediction task, at a fraction of the computational
    cost.

  abstract: Popular word embedding methods such as word2vec and GloVe assign a single
    vector representation to each word, even if a word has multiple distinct meanings.
    Multi-sense embeddings instead provide different vectors for each sense of a word.
    However, they typically cannot serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional
    single-sense embeddings, because the correct sense vector needs to be selected
    for each word. In this work, we study the effect of multi-sense embeddings on
    the task of reverse dictionaries. We propose a technique to easily integrate them
    into an existing neural network architecture using an attention mechanism. Our
    experiments demonstrate that large improvements can be obtained when employing
    multi-sense embeddings both in the input sequence as well as for the target representation.
    An analysis of the sense distributions and of the learned attention is provided
    as well.

  abstract: "As opposed to word sense induction, word sense disambiguation (WSD) has\
    \ the advantage of us-ing interpretable senses, but requires annotated data, which\
    \ are quite rare for most languages except English (Miller et al. 1993; Fellbaum,\
    \ 1998). In this paper, we investigate which strategy to adopt to achieve WSD\
    \ for languages lacking data that was annotated specifically for the task, focusing\
    \ on the particular case of verb disambiguation in French. We first study the\
    \ usability of Eurosense (Bovi et al. 2017) , a multilingual corpus extracted\
    \ from Europarl (Kohen, 2005) and automatically annotated with BabelNet (Navigli\
    \ and Ponzetto, 2010) senses. Such a resource opened up the way to supervised\
    \ and semi-supervised WSD for resourceless languages like French. While this perspective\
    \ looked promising, our evaluation on French verbs was inconclusive and showed\
    \ the annotated senses\u2019 quality was not sufficient for supervised WSD on\
    \ French verbs. Instead, we propose to use Wiktionary, a collaboratively edited,\
    \ multilingual online dictionary, as a resource for WSD. Wiktionary provides both\
    \ sense inventory and manually sense tagged examples which can be used to train\
    \ supervised and semi-supervised WSD systems. Yet, because senses\u2019 distribution\
    \ differ in lexicographic examples found in Wiktionary with respect to natural\
    \ text, we then focus on studying the impact on WSD of the training data size\
    \ and senses\u2019 distribution. Using state-of-the art semi-supervised systems,\
    \ we report experiments of Wiktionary-based WSD for French verbs, evaluated on\
    \ FrenchSemEval (FSE), a new dataset of French verbs manually annotated with wiktionary\
    \ senses."

  abstract: Word embedding representations provide good estimates of word meaning
    and give state-of-the art performance in semantic tasks. Embedding approaches
    differ as to whether and how they account for the context surrounding a word.
    We present a comparison of different word and context representations on the task
    of proposing substitutes for a target word in context (lexical substitution).
    We also experiment with tuning contextualized word embeddings on a dataset of
    sense-specific instances for each target word. We show that powerful contextualized
    word representations, which give high performance in several semantics-related
    tasks, deal less well with the subtle in-context similarity relationships needed
    for substitution. This is better handled by models trained with this objective
    in mind, where the inter-dependence between word and context representations is
    explicitly modeled during training.

  abstract: "Propelling, and propelled by, the \u201Cdeep learning revolution\u201D\
    , recent years have seen the introduction of ever larger corpora of images annotated\
    \ with natural language expressions. We survey some of these corpora, taking a\
    \ perspective that reverses the usual directionality, as it were, by viewing the\
    \ images as semantic annotation of the natural language expressions. We discuss\
    \ datasets that can be derived from the corpora, and tasks of potential interest\
    \ for computational semanticists that can be defined on those. In this, we make\
    \ use of relations provided by the corpora (namely, the link between expression\
    \ and image, and that between two expressions linked to the same image) and relations\
    \ that we can add (similarity relations between expressions, or between images).\
    \ Specifically, we show that in this way we can create data that can be used to\
    \ learn and evaluate lexical and compositional grounded semantics, and we show\
    \ that the \u201Clinked to same image\u201D relation tracks a semantic implication\
    \ relation that is recognisable to annotators even in the absence of the linking\
    \ image as evidence. Finally, as an example of possible benefits of this approach,\
    \ we show that an exemplar-model-based approach to implication beats a (simple)\
    \ distributional space-based one on some derived datasets, while lending itself\
    \ to explainability."

  abstract: 'Categorization is a central capability of human cognition, and a number
    of theories have been developed to account for properties of categorization. Even
    though many tasks in semantics also involve categorization of some kind, theories
    of categorization do not play a major role in contemporary research in computational
    linguistics. This paper follows the idea that embedding-based models of semantics
    lend themselves well to being formulated in terms of classical categorization
    theories. The benefit is a space of model families that enables (a) the formulation
    of hypotheses about the impact of major design decisions, and (b) a transparent
    assessment of these decisions. We instantiate this idea on the task of frame-semantic
    frame identification. We define four models that cross two design variables: (a)
    the choice of prototype vs. exemplar categorization, corresponding to different
    degrees of generalization applied to the input; and (b) the presence vs. absence
    of a fine-tuning step, corresponding to generic vs. task-adaptive categorization.
    We find that for frame identification, generalization and task-adaptive categorization
    both yield substantial benefits. Our prototype-based, fine-tuned model, which
    combines the best choices for these variables, establishes a new state of the
    art in frame identification.'

  abstract: We explore a novel application for interpreting semantic type coercions,
    motivated by insight into the role that perceptual affordances play in the selection
    of the semantic roles of artefactual nouns which are observed as arguments for
    verbs which would stereotypically select for objects of a different type. In order
    to simulate affordances, which we take to be direct perceptions of context-specific
    opportunities for action, we preform a distributional analysis dependency relationships
    between target words and their modifiers and adjuncts. We use these relationships
    as the basis for generating on-line transformations which project semantic subspaces
    in which the interpretations of coercive compositions are expected to emerge as
    salient word-vectors. We offer some preliminary examples of how this model operates
    on a dataset of sentences involving coercive interactions between verbs and objects
    specifically designed to evaluate this work.

  abstract: "Distributional semantics models (DSMs) are known to produce excellent\
    \ representations of word meaning, which correlate with a range of behavioural\
    \ data. As lexical representations, they have been said to be fundamentally different\
    \ from truth-theoretic models of semantics, where meaning is defined as a correspondence\
    \ relation to the world. There are two main aspects to this difference: a) DSMs\
    \ are built over corpus data which may or may not reflect \u2018what is in the\
    \ world\u2019; b) they are built from word co-occurrences, that is, from lexical\
    \ types rather than entities and sets. In this paper, we inspect the properties\
    \ of a distributional model built over a set-theoretic approximation of \u2018\
    the real world\u2019. To achieve this, we take the annotation a large database\
    \ of images marked with objects, attributes and relations, convert the data into\
    \ a representation akin to first-order logic and build several distributional\
    \ models using various combinations of features. We evaluate those models over\
    \ both relatedness and similarity datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness\
    \ in standard evaluations. This allows us to conclude that, despite prior claims,\
    \ truth-theoretic models are good candidates for building graded lexical representations\
    \ of meaning."

  abstract: Recently, sequence-to-sequence models have achieved impressive performance
    on a number of semantic parsing tasks. However, they often do not exploit available
    linguistic resources, while these, when employed correctly, are likely to increase
    performance even further. Research in neural machine translation has shown that
    employing this information has a lot of potential, especially when using a multi-encoder
    setup. We employ a range of semantic and syntactic resources to improve performance
    for the task of Discourse Representation Structure Parsing. We show that (i) linguistic
    features can be beneficial for neural semantic parsing and (ii) the best method
    of adding these features is by using multiple encoders.

  abstract: In recent years, both cognitive and computational research has provided
    empirical analyses of contextual co-occurrence of concrete and abstract words,
    partially resulting in inconsistent pictures. In this work we provide a more fine-grained
    description of the distributional nature in the corpus-based interaction of verbs
    and nouns within subcategorisation, by investigating the concreteness of verbs
    and nouns that are in a specific syntactic relationship with each other, i.e.,
    subject, direct object, and prepositional object. Overall, our experiments show
    consistent patterns in the distributional representation of subcategorising and
    subcategorised concrete and abstract words. At the same time, the studies reveal
    empirical evidence why contextual abstractness represents a valuable indicator
    for automatic non-literal language identification.

  abstract: Referring expressions and definite descriptions of objects in space exploit
    information both about object characteristics and locations. To resolve potential
    ambiguity, referencing strategies in language can rely on increasingly abstract
    concepts to distinguish an object in a given location from similar ones elsewhere,
    yet the description of the intended location may still be imprecise or difficult
    to interpret. Meanwhile, modalities such as gesture may communicate spatial information
    such as locations in a more concise manner. In real peer-to-peer communication,
    humans use language and gesture together to reference entities, with a capacity
    for mixing and changing modalities where needed. While recent progress in AI and
    human-computer interaction has created systems where a human can interact with
    a computer multimodally, computers often lack the capacity to intelligently mix
    modalities when generating referring expressions. We present a novel dataset of
    referring expressions combining natural language and gesture, describe its creation
    and evaluation, and its uses to train computational models for generating and
    interpreting multimodal referring expressions.

  abstract: Word embedding is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
    map words into vector space representations. Since it has boosted the performance
    of many NLP downstream tasks, the task of learning word embeddings has been addressing
    significantly. Nevertheless, most of the underlying word embedding methods such
    as word2vec and GloVe fail to produce high-quality embeddings if the text corpus
    is small and sparse. This paper proposes a method to generate effective word embeddings
    from limited data. Through experiments, we show that our proposed model outperforms
    existing works for the classical word similarity task and for a domain-specific
    application.

  abstract: We present a simple method to find topics in user reviews that accompany
    ratings for products or services. Standard topic analysis will perform sub-optimal
    on such data since the word distributions in the documents are not only determined
    by the topics but by the sentiment as well. We reduce the influence of the sentiment
    on the topic selection by adding two explicit topics, representing positive and
    negative sentiment. We evaluate the proposed method on a set of over 15,000 hospital
    reviews. We show that the proposed method, Latent Semantic Analysis with explicit
    word features, finds topics with a much smaller bias for sentiments than other
    similar methods.

  abstract: We know that word embeddings trained using neural-based methods (such
    as word2vec SGNS) are sensitive to stability problems and that across two models
    trained using the exact same set of parameters, the nearest neighbors of a word
    are likely to change. All words are not equally impacted by this internal instability
    and recent studies have investigated features influencing the stability of word
    embeddings. This stability can be seen as a clue for the reliability of the semantic
    representation of a word. In this work, we investigate the influence of the degree
    of concreteness of nouns on the stability of their semantic representation. We
    show that for English generic corpora, abstract words are more affected by stability
    problems than concrete words. We also found that to a certain extent, the difference
    between the degree of concreteness of a noun and its nearest neighbors can partly
    explain the stability or instability of its neighbors.

  abstract: "Under the standard approach to counterfactuals, to determine the meaning\
    \ of a counterfactual sentence, we consider the \u201Cclosest\u201D possible world(s)\
    \ where the antecedent is true, and evaluate the consequent. Building on the standard\
    \ approach, some researchers have found that the set of worlds to be considered\
    \ is dependent on context; it evolves with the discourse. Others have focused\
    \ on how to define the \u201Cdistance\u201D between possible worlds, using ideas\
    \ from causal modeling. This paper integrates the two ideas. We present a semantics\
    \ for counterfactuals that uses a distance measure based on causal laws, that\
    \ can also change over time. We show how our semantics can be implemented in the\
    \ Haskell programming language."

  abstract: In this paper, I will describe a system that was developed for the task
    of Visual Question Answering. The system uses the rich type universe of Type Theory
    with Records (TTR) to model both the utterances about the image, the image itself
    and classifications made related to the two. At its most basic, the decision of
    whether any given predicate can be assigned to an object in the image is delegated
    to a CNN. Consequently, images can be judged as evidence for propositions. The
    end result is a model whose application of perceptual classifiers to a given image
    is guided by the accompanying utterance.

  abstract: 'The challenge of automatically describing images and videos has stimulated
    much research in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In order to
    test the semantic abilities of new algorithms, we need reliable and objective
    ways of measuring progress. We show that standard evaluation measures do not take
    into account the semantic richness of a description, and give the impression that
    sparse machine descriptions outperform rich human descriptions. We introduce and
    test a new measure of semantic ability based on relative lexical diversity. We
    show how our measure can work alongside existing measures to achieve state of
    the art correlation with human judgement of quality. We also introduce a new dataset:
    Rich-Sparse Descriptions, which provides 2K human and machine descriptions to
    stimulate interest into the semantic evaluation of machine descriptions.'

  abstract: We present and discuss a couple of approaches, including different types
    of projections, and some examples, discussing the use of fuzzy sets for modeling
    meaning of certain types of language constructs. We are mostly focusing on words
    other than adjectives and linguistic hedges as these categories are the most studied
    from before. We discuss logical and linguistic interpretations of membership functions.
    We argue that using fuzzy sets for modeling meaning of words and other natural
    language constructs, along with situations described with natural language is
    interesting both from purely linguistic perspective, and also as a knowledge representation
    for problems of computational linguistics and natural language processing.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present new results on applying topological data analysis
    to discourse structures. We show that topological information, extracted from
    the relationships between sentences can be used in inference, namely it can be
    applied to the very difficult legal entailment given in the COLIEE 2018 data set.
    Previous results of Doshi and Zadrozny (2018) and Gholizadeh et al. (2018) show
    that topological features are useful for classification. The applications of computational
    topology to entailment are novel in our view provide a new set of tools for discourse
    semantics: computational topology can perhaps provide a bridge between the brittleness
    of logic and the regression of neural networks. We discuss the advantages and
    disadvantages of using topological information, and some open problems such as
    explainability of the classifier decisions.'

  abstract: "The early phases of requirements engineering (RE) deal with a vast amount\
    \ of software requirements (i.e., requirements that define characteristics of\
    \ software systems), which are typically expressed in natural language. Analysing\
    \ such unstructured requirements, usually obtained from users\u2019 inputs, is\
    \ considered a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and inconsistency\
    \ of natural language. To support such a task, methods based on natural language\
    \ processing (NLP) can be employed. One of the more recent advances in NLP is\
    \ the use of word embeddings for capturing contextual information, which can then\
    \ be applied in word analogy tasks. In this paper, we describe a new resource,\
    \ i.e., embedding-based representations of semantic frames in FrameNet, which\
    \ was developed to support the detection of relations between software requirements.\
    \ Our embeddings, which encapsulate contextual information at the semantic frame\
    \ level, were trained on a large corpus of requirements (i.e., a collection of\
    \ more than three million mobile application reviews). The similarity between\
    \ these frame embeddings is then used as a basis for detecting semantic relatedness\
    \ between software requirements. Compared with existing resources underpinned\
    \ by word-level embeddings alone, and frame embeddings built upon pre-trained\
    \ vectors, our proposed frame embeddings obtained better performance against judgements\
    \ of an RE expert. These encouraging results demonstrate the strong potential\
    \ of the resource in supporting RE analysis tasks (e.g., traceability), which\
    \ we plan to investigate as part of our future work."

  abstract: This paper investigates data-driven segmentation using Re-Pair or Byte
    Pair Encoding-techniques. In contrast to previous work which has primarily been
    focused on subword units for machine translation, we are interested in the general
    properties of such segments above the word level. We call these segments r-grams,
    and discuss their properties and the effect they have on the token frequency distribution.
    The proposed approach is evaluated by demonstrating its viability in embedding
    techniques, both in monolingual and multilingual test settings. We also provide
    a number of qualitative examples of the proposed methodology, demonstrating its
    viability as a language-invariant segmentation procedure.

  abstract: 'Commonsense knowledge relations are crucial for advanced NLU tasks. We
    examine the learnability of such relations as represented in ConceptNet, taking
    into account their specific properties, which can make relation classification
    difficult: a given concept pair can be linked by multiple relation types, and
    relations can have multi-word arguments of diverse semantic types. We explore
    a neural open world multi-label classification approach that focuses on the evaluation
    of classification accuracy for individual relations. Based on an in-depth study
    of the specific properties of the ConceptNet resource, we investigate the impact
    of different relation representations and model variations. Our analysis reveals
    that the complexity of argument types and relation ambiguity are the most important
    challenges to address. We design a customized evaluation method to address the
    incompleteness of the resource that can be expanded in future work.'

  abstract: Semantic similarity between collocations, along with words similarity,
    is one of the main issues of NLP, which must be addressed, in particular, in order
    to facilitate the automatic thesaurus generation. In the paper, we consider the
    logical-linguistic model that allows defining the relation of semantic similarity
    of collocations via the logical-algebraic equations. We provide the model for
    English, Ukrainian and Russian text corpora. The implementation for each language
    is slightly different in the equations of the finite predicates algebra and used
    linguistic resources. As a dataset for our experiment, we use 5801 pairs of sentences
    of Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus for English and more than 1 000 texts
    of scientific papers for Russian and Ukrainian.

  abstract: For the analysis of contract texts, validated model texts, such as model
    clauses, can be used to identify reused contract clauses. This paper investigates
    how to calculate the similarity between titles of model clauses and headings extracted
    from contracts, and which similarity measure is most suitable for this. For the
    calculation of the similarities between title pairs we tested various variants
    of string similarity and token based similarity. We also compare two more semantic
    similarity measures based on word embeddings using pretrained embeddings and word
    embeddings trained on contract texts. The identification of the model clause title
    can be used as a starting point for the mapping of clauses found in contracts
    to verified clauses.

  abstract: We present a very simple, unsupervised method for the pairwise matching
    of documents from heterogeneous collections. We demonstrate our method with the
    Concept-Project matching task, which is a binary classification task involving
    pairs of documents from heterogeneous collections. Although our method only employs
    standard resources without any domain- or task-specific modifications, it clearly
    outperforms the more complex system of the original authors. In addition, our
    method is transparent, because it provides explicit information about how a similarity
    score was computed, and efficient, because it is based on the aggregation of (pre-computable)
    word-level similarities.

  abstract: 'Much work in contemporary computational semantics follows the distributional
    hypothesis (DH), which is understood as an approach to semantics according to
    which the meaning of a word is a function of its distribution over contexts which
    is represented as vectors (word embeddings) within a multi-dimensional semantic
    space. In practice, use is identified with occurrence in text corpora, though
    there are some efforts to use corpora containing multi-modal information. In this
    paper we argue that the distributional hypothesis is intrinsically misguided as
    a self-supporting basis for semantics, as Firth was entirely aware. We mention
    philosophical arguments concerning the lack of normativity within DH data. Furthermore,
    we point out the shortcomings of DH as a model of learning, by discussing a variety
    of linguistic classes that cannot be learnt on a distributional basis, including
    indexicals, proper names, and wh-phrases. Instead of pursuing DH, we sketch an
    account of the problematic learning cases by integrating a rich, Firthian notion
    of dialogue context with interactive learning in signalling games backed by in
    probabilistic Type Theory with Records. We conclude that the success of the DH
    in computational semantics rests on a post hoc effect: DS presupposes a referential
    semantics on the basis of which utterances can be produced, comprehended and analysed
    in the first place.'

  abstract: "Generating \u201Ccommonsense\u2019\u2019 knowledge for intelligent understanding\
    \ and reasoning is a difficult, long-standing problem, whose scale challenges\
    \ the capacity of any approach driven primarily by human input. Furthermore, approaches\
    \ based on mining statistically repetitive patterns fail to produce the rich representations\
    \ humans acquire, and fall far short of human efficiency in inducing knowledge\
    \ from text. The idea of our approach to this problem is to provide a learning\
    \ system with a \u201Chead start\u201D consisting of a semantic parser, some basic\
    \ ontological knowledge, and most importantly, a small set of very general schemas\
    \ about the kinds of patterns of events (often purposive, causal, or socially\
    \ conventional) that even a one- or two-year-old could reasonably be presumed\
    \ to possess. We match these initial schemas to simple children\u2019s stories,\
    \ obtaining concrete instances, and combining and abstracting these into new candidate\
    \ schemas. Both the initial and generated schemas are specified using a rich,\
    \ expressive logical form. While modern approaches to schema reasoning often only\
    \ use slot-and-filler structures, this logical form allows us to specify complex\
    \ relations and constraints over the slots. Though formal, the representations\
    \ are language-like, and as such readily relatable to NL text. The agents, objects,\
    \ and other roles in the schemas are represented by typed variables, and the event\
    \ variables can be related through partial temporal ordering and causal relations.\
    \ To match natural language stories with existing schemas, we first parse the\
    \ stories into an underspecified variant of the logical form used by the schemas,\
    \ which is suitable for most concrete stories. We include a walkthrough of matching\
    \ a children\u2019s story to these schemas and generating inferences from these\
    \ matches."

  abstract: Dependent Type Semantics (DTS; Bekki and Mineshima, 2017) is a proof-theoretic
    compositional dynamic semantics based on Dependent Type Theory. The semantic representations
    for declarative sentences in DTS are types, based on the propositions-as-types
    paradigm. While type-theoretic semantics for natural language based on dependent
    type theory has been developed by many authors, how to assign semantic representations
    to interrogative sentences has been a non-trivial problem. In this study, we show
    how to provide the semantics of interrogative sentences in DTS. The basic idea
    is to assign the same type to both declarative sentences and interrogative sentences,
    partly building on the recent proposal in Inquisitive Semantics. We use Combinatory
    Categorial Grammar (CCG) as a syntactic component of DTS and implement our compositional
    semantics for interrogative sentences using ccg2lambda, a semantic parsing platform
    based on CCG. Based on the idea that the relationship between questions and answers
    can be formulated as the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), we implement
    our inference system using proof assistant Coq and show that our system can deal
    with a wide range of question-answer relationships discussed in the formal semantics
    literature, including those with polar questions, alternative questions, and wh-questions.

  abstract: The paper presents the IWCS 2019 shared task on semantic parsing where
    the goal is to produce Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs) for English
    sentences. DRSs originate from Discourse Representation Theory and represent scoped
    meaning representations that capture the semantics of negation, modals, quantification,
    and presupposition triggers. Additionally, concepts and event-participants in
    DRSs are described with WordNet synsets and the thematic roles from VerbNet. To
    measure similarity between two DRSs, they are represented in a clausal form, i.e.
    as a set of tuples. Participant systems were expected to produce DRSs in this
    clausal form. Taking into account the rich lexical information, explicit scope
    marking, a high number of shared variables among clauses, and highly-constrained
    format of valid DRSs, all these makes the DRS parsing a challenging NLP task.
    The results of the shared task displayed improvements over the existing state-of-the-art
    parser.

  abstract: We describe the systems we developed for Discourse Representation Structure
    (DRS) parsing as part of the IWCS-2019 Shared Task of DRS Parsing.1 Our systems
    are based on sequence-to-sequence modeling. To implement our model, we use the
    open-source neural machine translation system implemented in PyTorch, OpenNMT-py.
    We experimented with a variety of encoder-decoder models based on recurrent neural
    networks and the Transformer model. We conduct experiments on the standard benchmark
    of the Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB 2.2). Our best system achieves a score of 84.8%
    F1 in the DRS parsing shared task.

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in the shared task of Discourse
    Representation Structure parsing. It follows the work of Van Noord et al. (2018),
    who employed a neural sequence-to-sequence model to produce DRSs, also exploiting
    linguistic information with multiple encoders. We provide a detailed look in the
    performance of this model and show that (i) the benefit of the linguistic features
    is evident across a number of experiments which vary the amount of training data
    and (ii) the model can be improved by applying a number of postprocessing methods
    to fix ill-formed output. Our model ended up in second place in the competition,
    with an F-score of 84.5.

  abstract: "Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and other microblogging forums\
    \ have emerged as a platform for people to express their opinions and views on\
    \ different issues and events. It is often observed that people tend to take a\
    \ stance; in favor, against or neutral towards a particular topic. The task of\
    \ assessing the stance taken by the individual became significantly important\
    \ with the emergence in the usage of online social platforms. Automatic stance\
    \ detection system understands the user\u2019s stance by analyzing the standalone\
    \ texts against a target entity. Due to the limited contextual information a single\
    \ sentence provides, it is challenging to solve this task effectively. In this\
    \ paper, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based deep neural network architecture\
    \ for automatically detecting stance present in the code-mixed corpus. We apply\
    \ our approach on Hindi-English code-mixed corpus against the target entity -\
    \ \u201CDemonetisation.\u201D Our best model achieved the result with a stance\
    \ prediction accuracy of 63.2% which is a 4.5% overall accuracy improvement compared\
    \ to the current supervised classification systems developed using the benchmark\
    \ dataset for code-mixed data stance detection."

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a soft label approach to target-level sentiment
    classification task, in which a history-based soft labeling model is proposed
    to measure the possibility of a context word as an opinion word. We also apply
    a convolution layer to extract local active features, and introduce positional
    weights to take relative distance information into consideration. In addition,
    we obtain more informative target representation by training with context tokens
    together to make deeper interaction between target and context tokens. We conduct
    experiments on SemEval 2014 datasets and the experimental results show that our
    approach significantly outperforms previous models and gives state-of-the-art
    results on these datasets.

  abstract: We propose an attention-based neural network approach to detect abusive
    speech in online social networks. Our approach enables more effective modeling
    of context and the semantic relationships between words. We also empirically evaluate
    the value of text pre-processing techniques in addressing the challenge of out-of-vocabulary
    words in toxic content. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the Wikipedia
    Talk page datasets, showing improved predictive power over the previous state-of-the-art.

  abstract: "Adjective phrases like \u201Ca little bit surprised\u201D, \u201Ccompletely\
    \ shocked\u201D, or \u201Cnot stunned at all\u201D are not handled properly by\
    \ current state-of-the-art emotion classification and intensity prediction systems.\
    \ Based on this finding, we analyze differences between embeddings used by these\
    \ systems in regard to their capability of handling such cases and argue that\
    \ intensifiers in context of emotion words need special treatment, as is established\
    \ for sentiment polarity classification, but not for more fine-grained emotion\
    \ prediction. To resolve this issue, we analyze different aspects of a post-processing\
    \ pipeline which enriches the word representations of such phrases. This includes\
    \ expansion of semantic spaces at the phrase level and sub-word level followed\
    \ by retrofitting to emotion lexicons. We evaluate the impact of these steps with\
    \ \u2018A La Carte and Bag-of-Substrings extensions based on pretrained GloVe,Word2vec,\
    \ and fastText embeddings against a crowd-sourced corpus of intensity annotations\
    \ for tweets containing our focus phrases. We show that the fastText-based models\
    \ do not gain from handling these specific phrases under inspection. For Word2vec\
    \ embeddings, we show that our post-processing pipeline improves the results by\
    \ up to 8% on a novel dataset densly populated with intensifiers while it does\
    \ not decrease the performance on the established EmoInt dataset."

  abstract: "We investigate the relationship between basic principles of human morality\
    \ and the expression of opinions in user-generated text data. We assume that people\u2019\
    s backgrounds, culture, and values are associated with their perceptions and expressions\
    \ of everyday topics, and that people\u2019s language use reflects these perceptions.\
    \ While personal values and social effects are abstract and complex concepts,\
    \ they have practical implications and are relevant for a wide range of NLP applications.\
    \ To extract human values (in this paper, morality) and measure social effects\
    \ (morality and stance), we empirically evaluate the usage of a morality lexicon\
    \ that we expanded via a quality controlled, human in the loop process. As a result,\
    \ we enhanced the Moral Foundations Dictionary in size (from 324 to 4,636 syntactically\
    \ disambiguated entries) and scope. We used both lexica for feature-based and\
    \ deep learning classification (SVM, RF, and LSTM) to test their usefulness for\

  abstract: We propose bilingual word embeddings based on word2vec and fastText models
    (CBOW and Skip-gram) to address the problem of Humor detection in Hindi-English
    code-mixed tweets in combination with deep learning architectures. We focus on
    deep learning approaches which are not widely used on code-mixed data and analyzed
    their performance by experimenting with three different neural network models.
    We propose convolution neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long-short term
    memory (biLSTM) (with and without Attention) models which take the generated bilingual
    embeddings as input. We make use of Twitter data to create bilingual word embeddings.
    All our proposed architectures outperform the state-of-the-art results, and Attention-based
    bidirectional LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 73.6% which is an increment of
    more than 4% compared to the current state-of-the-art results.

  abstract: "In 2014, a chatty but immobile robot called hitchBOT set out to hitchhike\
    \ across Canada. It similarly made its way across Germany and the Netherlands,\
    \ and had begun a trip across the USA when it was destroyed by vandals. In this\
    \ work, we analyze the emotions and sentiments associated with words in tweets\
    \ posted before and after hitchBOT\u2019s destruction to answer two questions:\
    \ Were there any differences in the emotions expressed across the different countries\
    \ visited by hitchBOT? And how did the public react to the demise of hitchBOT?\
    \ Our analyses indicate that while there were few cross-cultural differences in\
    \ sentiment towards hitchBOT, there was a significant negative emotional reaction\
    \ to its destruction, suggesting that people had formed an emotional connection\
    \ with hitchBOT and perceived its destruction as morally wrong. We discuss potential\
    \ implications of anthropomorphism and emotional attachment to robots from the\
    \ perspective of robot ethics."

    \ machine learning-based (ML) classifier. The rule-based classifier conveys the\
    \ crux of the numerical sarcasm problem, namely, incongruity arising out of numbers.\
    \ The statistical ML classifier uncovers the indicators i.e., features of such\
    \ sarcasm. The actual system in place, however, are two deep learning (DL) models,\
    \ CNN and attention network that obtains an F-score of 0.93 and 0.91 on our dataset\
    \ of tweets containing numbers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\
    \ line of research investigating the phenomenon of sarcasm arising out of numbers,\
    \ culminating in a detector thereof."

  abstract: 'Wide and universal changes in the web content due to the growth of web
    2 applications increase the importance of user-generated content on the web. Therefore,
    the related research areas such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and subjectivity
    detection receives much attention from the research community. Due to the diverse
    languages that web-users use to express their opinions and sentiments, research
    areas like subjectivity detection should present methods which are practicable
    on all languages. An important prerequisite to effectively achieve this aim is
    considering the limitations in resource-lean languages. In this paper, cross-lingual
    subjectivity detection on resource lean languages is investigated using two different
    approaches: a language-model based and a learning-to-rank approach. Experimental
    results show the impact of different factors on the performance of subjectivity
    detection methods using English resources to detect the subjectivity score of
    Persian documents. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed learning-to-rank
    method outperforms the baseline method in ranking documents based on their subjectivity
    degree.'

  abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of incorporating emotion classes
    on the task of predicting emojis from Twitter texts. More specifically, we first
    show that there is a correlation between the emotion expressed in the text and
    the emoji choice of Twitter users. Based on this insight we propose a few simple
    methods to incorporate emotion information in traditional classifiers. Through
    automatic metrics, human evaluation, and error analysis, we show that the improvement
    obtained by incorporating emotion is significant and correlate better with human
    preferences compared to the baseline models. Through the human ratings that we
    obtained, we also argue for preference metric to better evaluate the usefulness
    of an emoji prediction system.

    for the Cuneiform Language Identification (CLI) shared task at the 2019 VarDial
    evaluation campaign. We compare a state-of-the-art baseline relying on character
    n-grams and a traditional statistical classifier, a voting ensemble of classifiers,
    and a deep learning approach using a Transformer network. We describe how these
    systems were trained, and analyze the impact of some preprocessing and model estimation
    decisions. The deep neural network achieved 77% accuracy on the test data, which
    turned out to be the best performance at the CLI evaluation, establishing a new
    state-of-the-art for cuneiform language identification.

  abstract: 'The conversion of romanized texts back to the native scripts is a challenging
    task because of the inconsistent romanization conventions and non-standard language
    use. This problem is compounded by code-mixing, i.e., using words from more than
    one language within the same discourse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
    for handling these two problems together in a single system. Our approach combines
    three components: language identification, back-transliteration, and sequence
    prediction. The results of our experiments on Bengali and Hindi datasets establish
    the state of the art for the task of deromanization of code-mixed texts.'

    detection in the Russian, Ukranian, Belarusian languages. We present new datasets,
    annotated with the word stress, for the three languages and compare several RNN
    models trained on three languages and explore possible applications of the transfer

    three main contributions: (i) introducing data-driven language mapping as a method

    producing a large and dynamic set of syntactic features using grammar induction

  abstract: 'This paper describes the work done by team tearsofjoy participating in
    the VarDial 2019 Evaluation Campaign. We developed two systems based on Support
    Vector Machines: SVM with a flat combination of features and SVM ensembles. We
    participated in all language/dialect identification tasks, as well as the Moldavian
    vs. Romanian cross-dialect topic identification (MRC) task. Our team achieved
    first place in German Dialect identification (GDI) and MRC subtasks 2 and 3, second
    place in the simplified variant of Discriminating between Mainland and Taiwan
    variation of Mandarin Chinese (DMT) as well as Cuneiform Language Identification
    (CLI), and third and fifth place in DMT traditional and MRC subtask 1 respectively.
    In most cases, the SVM with a flat combination of features performed better than
    SVM ensembles. Besides describing the systems and the results obtained by them,
    we provide a tentative comparison between the feature combination methods, and
    present additional experiments with a method of adaptation to the test set, which
    may indicate potential pitfalls with some of the data sets.'

  abstract: This paper deals with the automatic identification of literate and oral
    discourse in German texts. A range of linguistic features is selected and their
    role in distinguishing between literate- and oral-oriented registers is investigated,
    using a decision-tree classifier. It turns out that all of the investigated features
    are related in some way to oral conceptuality. Especially simple measures of complexity
    (average sentence and word length) are prominent indicators of oral and literate
    discourse. In addition, features of reference and deixis (realized by different
    types of pronouns) also prove to be very useful in determining the degree of orality
    of different registers.

  abstract: 'This work explores neural machine translation between Myanmar (Burmese)
    and Rakhine (Arakanese). Rakhine is a language closely related to Myanmar, often
    considered a dialect. We implemented three prominent neural machine translation
    (NMT) systems: recurrent neural networks (RNN), transformer, and convolutional
    neural networks (CNN). The systems were evaluated on a Myanmar-Rakhine parallel
    text corpus developed by us. In addition, two types of word segmentation schemes
    for word embeddings were studied: Word-BPE and Syllable-BPE segmentation. Our
    experimental results clearly show that the highest quality NMT and statistical
    machine translation (SMT) performances are obtained with Syllable-BPE segmentation
    for both types of translations. If we focus on NMT, we find that the transformer
    with Word-BPE segmentation outperforms CNN and RNN for both Myanmar-Rakhine and
    Rakhine-Myanmar translation. However, CNN with Syllable-BPE segmentation obtains
    a higher score than the RNN and transformer.'

  abstract: This article introduces a corpus of cuneiform texts from which the dataset
    for the use of the Cuneiform Language Identification (CLI) 2019 shared task was
    derived as well as some preliminary language identification experiments conducted
    using that corpus. We also describe the CLI dataset and how it was derived from
    the corpus. In addition, we provide some baseline language identification results
    using the CLI dataset. To the best of our knowledge, the experiments detailed
    here represent the first time that automatic language identification methods have
    been used on cuneiform data.

  abstract: Linguistic Code Switching (CS) is a phenomenon that occurs when multilingual
    speakers alternate between two or more languages/dialects within a single conversation.
    Processing CS data is especially challenging in intra-sentential data given state-of-the-art
    monolingual NLP technologies since such technologies are geared toward the processing
    of one language at a time. In this paper, we address the problem of Part-of-Speech
    tagging (POS) in the context of linguistic code switching (CS). We explore leveraging
    multiple neural network architectures to measure the impact of different pre-trained
    embeddings methods on POS tagging CS data. We investigate the landscape in four
    CS language pairs, Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Modern Standard Arabic- Egyptian
    Arabic dialect (MSA-EGY), and Modern Standard Arabic- Levantine Arabic dialect
    (MSA-LEV). Our results show that multilingual embedding (e.g., MSA-EGY and MSA-LEV)
    helps closely related languages (EGY/LEV) but adds noise to the languages that
    are distant (SPA/HIN). Finally, we show that our proposed models outperform state-of-the-art
    CS taggers for MSA-EGY language pair.

  abstract: 'Automatic dialect identification is a more challengingctask than language
    identification, as it requires the ability to discriminate between varieties of
    one language. In this paper, we propose an ensemble based system, which combines
    traditional machine learning models trained on bag of n-gram fetures, with deep
    learning models trained on word embeddings, to solve the Discriminating between
    Mainland and Taiwan Variation of Mandarin Chinese (DMT) shared task at VarDial
    2019. Our experiments show that a character bigram-trigram combination based Naive
    Bayes is a very strong model for identifying varieties of Mandarin Chinense. Through
    further ensemble of Navie Bayes and BiLSTM, our system (team: itsalexyang) achived
    an macro-averaged F1 score of 0.8530 and 0.8687 in two tracks.'

  abstract: '*This is a submission for the Third VarDial Evaluation Campaign* In this
    paper, we present a machine learning approach for the German Dialect Identification
    (GDI) Closed Shared Task of the DSL 2019 Challenge. The proposed approach combines
    deep and shallow models, by applying a voting scheme on the outputs resulted from
    a Character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (Char-CNN), a Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) network, and a model based on String Kernels. The first model used
    is the Char-CNN model that merges multiple convolutions computed with kernels
    of different sizes. The second model is the LSTM network which applies a global
    max pooling over the returned sequences over time. Both models pass the activation
    maps to two fully-connected layers. The final model is based on String Kernels,
    computed on character p-grams extracted from speech transcripts. The model combines
    two blended kernel functions, one is the presence bits kernel, and the other is
    the intersection kernel. The empirical results obtained in the shared task prove
    that the approach can achieve good results. The system proposed in this paper
    obtained the fourth place with a macro-F1 score of 62.55%'

  abstract: This paper describes the IUCL system at VarDial 2019 evaluation campaign
    for the task of discriminating between Mainland and Taiwan variation of mandarin
    Chinese. We first build several base classifiers, including a Naive Bayes classifier
    with word n-gram as features, SVMs with both character and syntactic features,
    and neural networks with pre-trained character/word embeddings. Then we adopt
    ensemble methods to combine output from base classifiers to make final predictions.
    Our ensemble models achieve the highest F1 score (0.893) in simplified Chinese
    track and the second highest (0.901) in traditional Chinese track. Our results
    demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the ensemble methods.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our models for the Moldavian vs. Romanian Cross-Topic
    Identification (MRC) evaluation campaign, part of the VarDial 2019 workshop. We
    focus on the three subtasks for MRC: binary classification between the Moldavian
    (MD) and the Romanian (RO) dialects and two cross-dialect multi-class classification
    between six news topics, MD to RO and RO to MD. We propose several deep learning
    models based on long short-term memory cells, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit
    (BiGRU) and Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN). We also employ three word embedding
    models to represent the text as a low dimensional vector. Our official submission
    includes two runs of the BiGRU and HAN models for each of the three subtasks.
    The best submitted model obtained the following macro-averaged F1 scores: 0.708
    for subtask 1, 0.481 for subtask 2 and 0.480 for the last one. Due to a read error
    caused by the quoting behaviour over the test file, our final submissions contained
    a smaller number of items than expected. More than 50% of the submission files
    were corrupted. Thus, we also present the results obtained with the corrected
    labels for which the HAN model achieves the following results: 0.930 for subtask
    1, 0.590 for subtask 2 and 0.687 for the third one.'

  abstract: This paper describes the language identification systems used by the SUKI
    team in the Discriminating between the Mainland and Taiwan variation of Mandarin
    Chinese (DMT) and the German Dialect Identification (GDI) shared tasks which were
    held as part of the third VarDial Evaluation Campaign. The DMT shared task included
    two separate tracks, one for the simplified Chinese script and one for the traditional
    Chinese script. We submitted three runs on both tracks of the DMT task as well
    as on the GDI task. We won the traditional Chinese track using Naive Bayes with
    language model adaptation, came second on GDI with an adaptive version of the
    HeLI 2.0 method, and third on the simplified Chinese track using again the adaptive
    Naive Bayes.

  abstract: 'Identification of the languages written using cuneiform symbols is a
    difficult task due to the lack of resources and the problem of tokenization. The
    Cuneiform Language Identification task in VarDial 2019 addresses the problem of
    identifying seven languages and dialects written in cuneiform; Sumerian and six
    dialects of Akkadian language: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian Peripheral, Standard
    Babylonian, Neo-Babylonian, Late Babylonian, and Neo-Assyrian. This paper describes
    the approaches taken by SharifCL team to this problem in VarDial 2019. The best
    result belongs to an ensemble of Support Vector Machines and a naive Bayes classifier,
    both working on character-level features, with macro-averaged F1-score of 72.10%.'

  abstract: We describe our approaches for the German Dialect Identification (GDI)
    and the Cuneiform Language Identification (CLI) tasks at the VarDial Evaluation
    Campaign 2019. The goal was to identify dialects of Swiss German in GDI and Sumerian
    and Akkadian in CLI. In GDI, the system should distinguish four dialects from
    the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Our system for GDI achieved third place
    out of 6 teams, with a macro averaged F-1 of 74.6%. In CLI, the system should
    distinguish seven languages written in cuneiform script. Our system achieved third
    place out of 8 teams, with a macro averaged F-1 of 74.7%.

  abstract: When translating diglossic languages such as Arabic, situations may arise
    where we would like to translate a text but do not know which dialect it is. A
    traditional approach to this problem is to design dialect identification systems
    and dialect-specific machine translation systems. However, under the recent paradigm
    of neural machine translation, shared multi-dialectal systems have become a natural
    alternative. Here we explore under which conditions it is beneficial to perform
    dialect identification for Arabic neural machine translation versus using a general
    system for all dialects.

  abstract: 'We tackle the important task of part-of-speech tagging using a neural
    model in the zero-resource scenario, where we have no access to gold-standard
    POS training data. We compare this scenario with the low-resource scenario, where
    we have access to a small amount of gold-standard POS training data. Our experiments
    focus on Ukrainian as a representative of under-resourced languages. Russian is
    highly related to Ukrainian, so we exploit gold-standard Russian POS tags. We
    consider four techniques to perform Ukrainian POS tagging: zero-shot tagging and
    cross-lingual annotation projection (for the zero-resource scenario), and compare
    these with self-training and multilingual learning (for the low-resource scenario).
    We find that cross-lingual annotation projection works particularly well in the
    zero-resource scenario.'

  abstract: Stack Long Short-Term Memory (StackLSTM) is useful for various applications
    such as parsing and string-to-tree neural machine translation, but it is also
    known to be notoriously difficult to parallelize for GPU training due to the fact
    that the computations are dependent on discrete operations. In this paper, we
    tackle this problem by utilizing state access patterns of StackLSTM to homogenize
    computations with regard to different discrete operations. Our parsing experiments
    show that the method scales up almost linearly with increasing batch size, and
    our parallelized PyTorch implementation trains significantly faster compared to
    the Dynet C++ implementation.

  abstract: Procedural text, which describes entities and their interactions as they
    undergo some process, depicts entities in a uniquely nuanced way. First, each
    entity may have some observable discrete attributes, such as its state or location;
    modeling these involves imposing global structure and enforcing consistency. Second,
    an entity may have properties which are not made explicit but can be effectively
    induced and tracked by neural networks. In this paper, we propose a structured
    neural architecture that reflects this dual nature of entity evolution. The model
    tracks each entity recurrently, updating its hidden continuous representation
    at each step to contain relevant state information. The global discrete state
    structure is explicitly modelled with a neural CRF over the changing hidden representation
    of the entity. This CRF can explicitly capture constraints on entity states over
    time, enforcing that, for example, an entity cannot move to a location after it
    is destroyed. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on QA tasks over
    process paragraphs in the ProPara dataset and find that our model achieves state-of-the-art
    results.

  abstract: 'We propose structured encoding as a novel approach to learning representations
    for relations and events in neural structured prediction. Our approach explicitly
    leverages the structure of available relation and event metadata to generate these
    representations, which are parameterized by both the attribute structure of the
    metadata as well as the learned representation of the arguments of the relations
    and events. We consider affine, biaffine, and recurrent operators for building
    hierarchical representations and modelling underlying features. We apply our approach
    to the second-order structured prediction task studied in the 2016/2017 Belief
    and Sentiment analysis evaluations (BeSt): given a document and its entities,
    relations, and events (including metadata and mentions), determine the sentiment
    of each entity towards every relation and event in the document. Without task-specific
    knowledge sources or domain engineering, we significantly improve over systems
    and baselines that neglect the available metadata or its hierarchical structure.
    We observe across-the-board improvements on the BeSt 2016/2017 sentiment analysis
    task of at least 2.3 (absolute) and 10.6% (relative) F-measure over the previous
    state-of-the-art.'

  abstract: 'We propose a lightly-supervised approach for information extraction,
    in particular named entity classification, which combines the benefits of traditional
    bootstrapping, i.e., use of limited annotations and interpretability of extraction
    patterns, with the robust learning approaches proposed in representation learning.
    Our algorithm iteratively learns custom embeddings for both the multi-word entities
    to be extracted and the patterns that match them from a few example entities per
    category. We demonstrate that this representation-based approach outperforms three
    other state-of-the-art bootstrapping approaches on two datasets: CoNLL-2003 and
    OntoNotes. Additionally, using these embeddings, our approach outputs a globally-interpretable
    model consisting of a decision list, by ranking patterns based on their proximity
    to the average entity embedding in a given class. We show that this interpretable
    model performs close to our complete bootstrapping model, proving that representation
    learning can be used to produce interpretable models with small loss in performance.
    This decision list can be edited by human experts to mitigate some of that loss
    and in some cases outperform the original model.'

  abstract: Generating a large amount of training data for information extraction
    (IE) is either costly (if annotations are created manually), or runs the risk
    of introducing noisy instances (if distant supervision is used). On the other
    hand, semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a cost-efficient solution to combat lack
    of training data. In this paper, we adapt Mean Teacher (Tarvainen and Valpola,
    2017), a denoising SSL framework to extract semantic relations between pairs of
    entities. We explore the sweet spot of amount of supervision required for good
    performance on this binary relation extraction task. Additionally, different syntax
    representations are incorporated into our models to enhance the learned representation
    of sentences. We evaluate our approach on the Google-IISc Distant Supervision
    (GDS) dataset, which removes test data noise present in all previous distance
    supervision datasets, which makes it a reliable evaluation benchmark (Jat et al.,
    2017). Our results show that the SSL Mean Teacher approach nears the performance
    of fully-supervised approaches even with only 10% of the labeled corpus. Further,
    the syntax-aware model outperforms other syntax-free approaches across all levels
    of supervision.

  abstract: In this paper we describe a multilingual grounded language learning system
    adapted from an English-only system. This system learns the meaning of words used
    in crowd-sourced descriptions by grounding them in the physical representations
    of the objects they are describing. Our work presents a framework to compare the
    performance of the system when applied to a new language and to identify modifications
    necessary to attain equal performance, with the goal of enhancing the ability
    of robots to learn language from a more diverse range of people. We then demonstrate
    this system with Spanish, through first analyzing the performance of translated
    Spanish, and then extending this analysis to a new corpus of crowd-sourced Spanish
    language data. We find that with small modifications, the system is able to learn
    color, object, and shape words with comparable performance between languages.

    \ physics-based scene is a flexible way to develop and test language-based human-robot\
    \ interaction, by virtualizing people, robot hardware and the target 3D environment.\
    \ Here, interaction means both controlling robots using language and conversing\
    \ with them about the user\u2019s physical environment and her daily life. Such\
    \ a virtual development framework was initially developed for the Bot Colony videogame\
    \ launched on Steam in June 2014, and has been undergoing improvements since.\
    \ The framework is focused of developing intuitive verbal interaction with various\

    \ planning and obstacle avoidance, task planning and constraints, grabbing and\
    \ inverse kinematics), the human participants in the interaction, and the impact\
    \ of gravity and other forces on the environment are all simulated using commercial\
    \ 3D tools. The framework can be used as a robotics testbed: the results of our\
    \ simulations can be compared with the output of algorithms in real robots, to\
    \ validate such algorithms. A novelty of our framework is support for social interaction\
    \ with robots - enabling robots to converse about people and objects in the user\u2019\
    s environment, as well as learning about human needs and everyday life topics\
    \ from their owner."

  abstract: "Human-robot interaction often occurs in the form of instructions given\
    \ from a human to a robot. For a robot to successfully follow instructions, a\
    \ common representation of the world and objects in it should be shared between\
    \ humans and the robot so that the instructions can be grounded. Achieving this\
    \ representation can be done via learning, where both the world representation\
    \ and the language grounding are learned simultaneously. However, in robotics\
    \ this can be a difficult task due to the cost and scarcity of data. In this paper,\
    \ we tackle the problem by separately learning the world representation of the\
    \ robot and the language grounding. While this approach can address the challenges\
    \ in getting sufficient data, it may give rise to inconsistencies between both\
    \ learned components. Therefore, we further propose Bayesian learning to resolve\
    \ such inconsistencies between the natural language grounding and a robot\u2019\
    s world representation by exploiting spatio-relational information that is implicitly\
    \ present in instructions given by a human. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility\
    \ of our approach on a scenario involving a robotic arm in the physical world."

  abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a natural language grounding task
    where agents have to interpret natural language instructions in the context of
    visual scenes in a dynamic environment to achieve prescribed navigation goals.
    Successful agents must have the ability to parse natural language of varying linguistic
    styles, ground them in potentially unfamiliar scenes, plan and react with ambiguous
    environmental feedback. Generalization ability is limited by the amount of human
    annotated data. In particular, paired vision-language sequence data is expensive
    to collect. We develop a discriminator that evaluates how well an instruction
    explains a given path in VLN task using multi-modal alignment. Our study reveals
    that only a small fraction of the high-quality augmented data from Fried et al.,
    as scored by our discriminator, is useful for training VLN agents with similar
    performance. We also show that a VLN agent warm-started with pre-trained components
    from the discriminator outperforms the benchmark success rates of 35.5 by 10%
    relative measure.

  abstract: It is important, for human-robot interaction, to endow the robot with
    the knowledge necessary to understand human needs and to be able to respond to
    them. We present a formalized and unified representation for indoor environments
    using an ontology devised for a route description task in which a robot must provide
    explanations to a person. We show that this representation can be used to choose
    a route to explain to a human as well as to verbalize it using a route perspective.
    Based on ontology, this representation has a strong possibility of evolution to
    adapt to many other applications. With it, we get the semantics of the environment
    elements while keeping a description of the known connectivity of the environment.
    This representation and the illustration algorithms, to find and verbalize a route,
    have been tested in two environments of different scales.

  abstract: This paper introduces SpatialNet, a novel resource which links linguistic
    expressions to actual spatial configurations. SpatialNet is based on FrameNet
    (Ruppenhofer et al., 2016) and VigNet (Coyne et al., 2011), two resources which
    use frame semantics to encode lexical meaning. SpatialNet uses a deep semantic
    representation of spatial relations to provide a formal description of how a language
    expresses spatial information. This formal representation of the lexical semantics
    of spatial language also provides a consistent way to represent spatial meaning
    across multiple languages. In this paper, we describe the structure of SpatialNet,
    with examples from English and German. We also show how SpatialNet can be combined
    with other existing NLP tools to create a text-to-scene system for a language.

  abstract: Understanding and generating spatial descriptions requires knowledge about
    what objects are related, their functional interactions, and where the objects
    are geometrically located. Different spatial relations have different functional
    and geometric bias. The wide usage of neural language models in different areas
    including generation of image description motivates the study of what kind of
    knowledge is encoded in neural language models about individual spatial relations.
    With the premise that the functional bias of relations is expressed in their word
    distributions, we construct multi-word distributional vector representations and
    show that these representations perform well on intrinsic semantic reasoning tasks,
    thus confirming our premise. A comparison of our vector representations to human
    semantic judgments indicates that different bias (functional or geometric) is
    captured in different data collection tasks which suggests that the contribution
    of the two meaning modalities is dynamic, related to the context of the task.

  abstract: Participating in conversations can be difficult for people with hearing
    loss, especially in acoustically challenging environments. We studied the preferences
    the hearing impaired have for a personal conversation assistant based on automatic
    speech recognition (ASR) technology. We created two prototypes which were evaluated
    by hearing impaired test users. This paper qualitatively compares the two based
    on the feedback obtained from the tests. The first prototype was a proof-of-concept
    system running real-time ASR on a laptop. The second prototype was developed for
    a mobile device with the recognizer running on a separate server. In the mobile
    device, augmented reality (AR) was used to help the hearing impaired observe gestures
    and lip movements of the speaker simultaneously with the transcriptions. Several
    testers found the systems useful enough to use in their daily lives, with majority
    preferring the mobile AR version. The biggest concern of the testers was the accuracy
    of the transcriptions and the lack of speaker identification.

  abstract: Prosodic cues in conversational speech aid listeners in discerning a message.
    We investigate whether acoustic cues in spoken dialogue can be used to identify
    the importance of individual words to the meaning of a conversation turn. Individuals
    who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing often rely on real-time captions in live meetings.
    Word error rate, a traditional metric for evaluating automatic speech recognition
    (ASR), fails to capture that some words are more important for a system to transcribe
    correctly than others. We present and evaluate neural architectures that use acoustic
    features for 3-class word importance prediction. Our model performs competitively
    against state-of-the-art text-based word-importance prediction models, and it
    demonstrates particular benefits when operating on imperfect ASR output.

  abstract: Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) are devices that enable speech communication
    when audible speech is unavailable. Articulation-to-speech (ATS) synthesis is
    a software design in SSI that directly converts articulatory movement information
    into audible speech signals. Permanent magnetic articulograph (PMA) is a wireless
    articulator motion tracking technology that is similar to commercial, wired Electromagnetic
    Articulograph (EMA). PMA has shown great potential for practical SSI applications,
    because it is wireless. The ATS performance of PMA, however, is unknown when compared
    with current EMA. In this study, we compared the performance of ATS using a PMA
    we recently developed and a commercially available EMA (NDI Wave system). Datasets
    with same stimuli and size that were collected from tongue tip were used in the
    comparison. The experimental results indicated the performance of PMA was close
    to, although not as equally good as that of EMA. Furthermore, in PMA, converting
    the raw magnetic signals to positional signals did not significantly affect the
    performance of ATS, which support the future direction in PMA-based ATS can be
    focused on the use of positional signals to maximize the benefit of spatial analysis.

  abstract: "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disease\
    \ that leads to degeneration of motor neurons and, as a result, inhibits the ability\
    \ of the brain to control muscle movements. Monitoring the progression of ALS\
    \ is of fundamental importance due to the wide variability in disease outlook\
    \ that exists across patients. This progression is typically tracked using the\
    \ ALS functional rating scale - revised (ALSFRS-R), which is the current clinical\
    \ assessment of a patient\u2019s level of functional impairment including speech\
    \ and other motor tasks. In this paper, we investigated automatic estimation of\
    \ the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscore from acoustic and articulatory movement samples.\
    \ Experimental results demonstrated the AFSFRS-R bulbar subscore can be predicted\
    \ from speech samples, which has clinical implication for automatic monitoring\
    \ of the disease progression of ALS using speech information."

  abstract: Blissymbolics (Bliss) is a pictographic writing system that is used by
    people with communication disorders. Bliss attempts to create a writing system
    that makes words easier to distinguish by using pictographic symbols that encapsulate
    meaning rather than sound, as the English alphabet does for example. Users of
    Bliss rely on human interpreters to use Bliss. We created a translation system
    from Bliss to natural English with the hopes of decreasing the reliance on human
    interpreters by the Bliss community. We first discuss the basic rules of Blissymbolics.
    Then we point out some of the challenges associated with developing computer assisted
    tools for Blissymbolics. Next we talk about our ongoing work in developing a translation
    system, including current limitations, and future work. We conclude with a set
    of examples showing the current capabilities of our translation system.

  abstract: Making good letter or word predictions can help accelerate the communication
    of users of high-tech AAC devices. This is particularly important for real-time
    person-to-person conversations. We investigate whether per forming speech recognition
    on the speaking-side of a conversation can improve language model based predictions.
    We compare the accuracy of three plausible microphone deployment options and the
    accuracy of two commercial speech recognition engines (Google and IBM Watson).
    We found that despite recognition word error rates of 7-16%, our ensemble of N-gram
    and recurrent neural network language models made predictions nearly as good as
    when they used the reference transcripts.

  abstract: Language models have broad adoption in predictive typing tasks. When the
    typing history contains numerous errors, as in open-vocabulary predictive typing
    with brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, we observe significant performance
    degradation in both n-gram and recurrent neural network language models trained
    on clean text. In evaluations of ranking character predictions, training recurrent
    LMs on noisy text makes them much more robust to noisy histories, even when the
    error model is misspecified. We also propose an effective strategy for combining
    evidence from multiple ambiguous histories of BCI electroencephalogram measurements.

  abstract: "Visual question answering (VQA) models have been shown to over-rely on\
    \ linguistic biases in VQA datasets, answering questions \u201Cblindly\u201D without\
    \ considering visual context. Adversarial regularization (AdvReg) aims to address\
    \ this issue via an adversary sub-network that encourages the main model to learn\
    \ a bias-free representation of the question. In this work, we investigate the\
    \ strengths and shortcomings of AdvReg with the goal of better understanding how\
    \ it affects inference in VQA models. Despite achieving a new state-of-the-art\
    \ on VQA-CP, we find that AdvReg yields several undesirable side-effects, including\
    \ unstable gradients and sharply reduced performance on in-domain examples. We\
    \ demonstrate that gradual introduction of regularization during training helps\
    \ to alleviate, but not completely solve, these issues. Through error analyses,\
    \ we observe that AdvReg improves generalization to binary questions, but impairs\
    \ performance on questions with heterogeneous answer distributions. Qualitatively,\
    \ we also find that regularized models tend to over-rely on visual features, while\
    \ ignoring important linguistic cues in the question. Our results suggest that\
    \ AdvReg requires further refinement before it can be considered a viable bias\
    \ mitigation technique for VQA."

  abstract: This paper presents a new task, the grounding of spatio-temporal identifying
    descriptions in videos. Previous work suggests potential bias in existing datasets
    and emphasizes the need for a new data creation schema to better model linguistic
    structure. We introduce a new data collection scheme based on grammatical constraints
    for surface realization to enable us to investigate the problem of grounding spatio-temporal
    identifying descriptions in videos. We then propose a two-stream modular attention
    network that learns and grounds spatio-temporal identifying descriptions based
    on appearance and motion. We show that motion modules help to ground motion-related
    words and also help to learn in appearance modules because modular neural networks
    resolve task interference between modules. Finally, we propose a future challenge
    and a need for a robust system arising from replacing ground truth visual annotations
    with automatic video object detector and temporal event localization.

  abstract: Image captioning applied to biomedical images can assist and accelerate
    the diagnosis process followed by clinicians. This article is the first survey
    of biomedical image captioning, discussing datasets, evaluation measures, and
    state of the art methods. Additionally, we suggest two baselines, a weak and a
    stronger one; the latter outperforms all current state of the art systems on one
    of the datasets.

  abstract: "We revisit a particular visual grounding method: the \u201CImage Retrieval\
    \ Using Scene Graphs\u201D (IRSG) system of Johnson et al. Our experiments indicate\
    \ that the system does not effectively use its learned object-relationship models.\
    \ We also look closely at the IRSG dataset, as well as the widely used Visual\
    \ Relationship Dataset (VRD) that is adapted from it. We find that these datasets\
    \ exhibit bias that allows methods that ignore relationships to perform relatively\
    \ well. We also describe several other problems with the IRSG dataset, and report\
    \ on experiments using a subset of the dataset in which the biases and other problems\
    \ are removed. Our studies contribute to a more general effort: that of better\
    \ understanding what machine-learning methods that combine language and vision\
    \ actually learn and what popular datasets actually test."

  abstract: Visual storytelling is an intriguing and complex task that only recently
    entered the research arena. In this work, we survey relevant work to date, and
    conduct a thorough error analysis of three very recent approaches to visual storytelling.
    We categorize and provide examples of common types of errors, and identify key
    shortcomings in current work. Finally, we make recommendations for addressing
    these limitations in the future.

  abstract: "We study verbs in image\u2013text corpora, contrasting caption corpora,\
    \ where texts are explicitly written to characterize image content, with depiction\
    \ corpora, where texts and images may stand in more general relations. Captions\
    \ show a distinctively limited distribution of verbs, with strong preferences\
    \ for specific tense, aspect, lexical aspect, and semantic field. These limitations,\
    \ which appear in data elicited by a range of methods, restrict the utility of\
    \ caption corpora to inform image retrieval, multimodal document generation, and\
    \ perceptually-grounded semantic models. We suggest that these limitations reflect\
    \ the discourse constraints in play when subjects write texts to accompany imagery,\
    \ so we argue that future development of image\u2013text corpora should work to\
    \ increase the diversity of event descriptions, while looking explicitly at the\
    \ different ways text and imagery can be coherently related."

  abstract: "There has been significant interest recently in learning multilingual\
    \ word embeddings \u2013 in which semantically similar words across languages\
    \ have similar embeddings. State-of-the-art approaches have relied on expensive\
    \ labeled data, which is unavailable for low-resource languages, or have involved\
    \ post-hoc unification of monolingual embeddings. In the present paper, we investigate\
    \ the efficacy of multilingual embeddings learned from weakly-supervised image-text\
    \ data. In particular, we propose methods for learning multilingual embeddings\
    \ using image-text data, by enforcing similarity between the representations of\
    \ the image and that of the text. Our experiments reveal that even without using\
    \ any expensive labeled data, a bag-of-words-based embedding model trained on\
    \ image-text data achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on crosslingual\
    \ semantic similarity tasks."

  abstract: Recent work on visually grounded language learning has focused on broader
    applications of grounded representations, such as visual question answering and
    multimodal machine translation. In this paper we consider grounded word sense
    translation, i.e. the task of correctly translating an ambiguous source word given
    the corresponding textual and visual context. Our main objective is to investigate
    the extent to which images help improve word-level (lexical) translation quality.
    We do so by first studying the dataset for this task to understand the scope and
    challenges of the task. We then explore different data settings, image features,
    and ways of grounding to investigate the gain from using images in each of the
    combinations. We find that grounding on the image is specially beneficial in weaker
    unidirectional recurrent translation models. We observe that adding structured
    image information leads to stronger gains in lexical translation accuracy.

  abstract: Crucial information about the practice of healthcare is recorded only
    in free-form text, which creates an enormous opportunity for high-impact NLP.
    However, annotated healthcare datasets tend to be small and expensive to obtain,
    which raises the question of how to make maximally efficient uses of the available
    data. To this end, we develop an LSTM-CRF model for combining unsupervised word
    representations and hand-built feature representations derived from publicly available
    healthcare ontologies. We show that this combined model yields superior performance
    on five datasets of diverse kinds of healthcare text (clinical, social, scientific,
    commercial). Each involves the labeling of complex, multi-word spans that pick
    out different healthcare concepts. We also introduce a new labeled dataset for
    identifying the treatment relations between drugs and diseases.

  abstract: 'The shift to electronic medical records (EMRs) has engendered research
    into machine learning and natural language technologies to analyze patient records,
    and to predict from these clinical outcomes of interest. Two observations motivate
    our aims here. First, unstructured notes contained within EMR often contain key
    information, and hence should be exploited by models. Second, while strong predictive
    performance is important, interpretability of models is perhaps equally so for
    applications in this domain. Together, these points suggest that neural models
    for EMR may benefit from incorporation of attention over notes, which one may
    hope will both yield performance gains and afford transparency in predictions.
    In this work we perform experiments to explore this question using two EMR corpora
    and four different predictive tasks, that: (i) inclusion of attention mechanisms
    is critical for neural encoder modules that operate over notes fields in order
    to yield competitive performance, but, (ii) unfortunately, while these boost predictive
    performance, it is decidedly less clear whether they provide meaningful support
    for predictions.'

  abstract: In this paper we describe an evaluation of the potential of classical
    information extraction methods to extract drug-related attributes, including adverse
    drug events, and compare to more recently developed neural methods. We use the
    2018 N2C2 shared task data as our gold standard data set for training. We train
    support vector machine classifiers to detect drug and drug attribute spans, and
    pair these detected entities as training instances for an SVM relation classifier,
    with both systems using standard features. We compare to baseline neural methods
    that use standard contextualized embedding representations for entity and relation
    extraction. The SVM-based system and a neural system obtain comparable results,
    with the SVM system doing better on concepts and the neural system performing
    better on relation extraction tasks. The neural system obtains surprisingly strong
    results compared to the system based on years of research in developing features
    for information extraction.

  abstract: In the medical domain and other scientific areas, it is often important
    to recognize different levels of hierarchy in mentions, such as those related
    to specific symptoms or diseases associated with different anatomical regions.
    Unlike previous approaches, we build a transition-based parser that explicitly
    models an arbitrary number of hierarchical and nested mentions, and propose a
    loss that encourages correct predictions of higher-level mentions. We further
    introduce a set of modifier classes which introduces certain concepts that change
    the meaning of an entity, such as absence, or uncertainty about a given disease.
    Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results in medical entity recognition
    datasets, using both nested and hierarchical mentions.

  abstract: Large-scale clinical data is invaluable to driving many computational
    scientific advances today. However, understandable concerns regarding patient
    privacy hinder the open dissemination of such data and give rise to suboptimal
    siloed research. De-identification methods attempt to address these concerns but
    were shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we focus on
    the vast amounts of unstructured natural language data stored in clinical notes
    and propose to automatically generate synthetic clinical notes that are more amenable
    to sharing using generative models trained on real de-identified records. To evaluate
    the merit of such notes, we measure both their privacy preservation properties
    as well as utility in training clinical NLP models. Experiments using neural language
    models yield notes whose utility is close to that of the real ones in some clinical
    NLP tasks, yet leave ample room for future improvements.

  abstract: "While much data within a patient\u2019s electronic health record (EHR)\
    \ is coded, crucial information concerning the patient\u2019s care and management\
    \ remain buried in unstructured clinical notes, making it difficult and time-consuming\
    \ for physicians to review during their usual clinical workflow. In this paper,\
    \ we present our clinical note processing pipeline, which extends beyond basic\
    \ medical natural language processing (NLP) with concept recognition and relation\
    \ detection to also include components specific to EHR data, such as structured\
    \ data associated with the encounter, sentence-level clinical aspects, and structures\
    \ of the clinical notes. We report on the use of this pipeline in a disease-specific\
    \ extractive text summarization task on clinical notes, focusing primarily on\
    \ progress notes by physicians and nurse practitioners. We show how the addition\
    \ of EHR-specific components to the pipeline resulted in an improvement in our\
    \ overall system performance and discuss the potential impact of EHR-specific\
    \ components on other higher-level clinical NLP tasks."

  abstract: This paper details the development of a linguistic resource designed to
    improve temporal information extraction systems and to integrate aspectual values.
    After a brief review of recent works in temporal information extraction for the
    medical area, we discuss the linguistic notion of aspect and how it got a place
    in the NLP field. Then, we present our clinical data and describe the five-step
    approach adopted in this study. Finally, we represent the linguistic resource
    itself and explain how we elaborated it and which properties were selected for
    the creation of the tables.

  abstract: 'Contextual word embedding models such as ELMo and BERT have dramatically
    improved performance for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent
    months. However, these models have been minimally explored on specialty corpora,
    such as clinical text; moreover, in the clinical domain, no publicly-available
    pre-trained BERT models yet exist. In this work, we address this need by exploring
    and releasing BERT models for clinical text: one for generic clinical text and
    another for discharge summaries specifically. We demonstrate that using a domain-specific
    model yields performance improvements on 3/5 clinical NLP tasks, establishing
    a new state-of-the-art on the MedNLI dataset. We find that these domain-specific
    models are not as performant on 2 clinical de-identification tasks, and argue
    that this is a natural consequence of the differences between de-identified source
    text and synthetically non de-identified task text.'

  abstract: Knowledge discovery from text in natural language is a task usually aided
    by the manual construction of annotated corpora. Specifically in the clinical
    domain, several annotation models are used depending on the characteristics of
    the task to solve (e.g., named entity recognition, relation extraction, etc.).
    However, few general-purpose annotation models exist, that can support a broad
    range of knowledge extraction tasks. This paper presents an annotation model designed
    to capture a large portion of the semantics of natural language text. The structure
    of the annotation model is presented, with examples of annotated sentences and
    a brief description of each semantic role and relation defined. This research
    focuses on an application to clinical texts in the Spanish language. Nevertheless,
    the presented annotation model is extensible to other domains and languages. An
    example of annotated sentences, guidelines, and suitable configuration files for
    an annotation tool are also provided for the research community.

  abstract: 'Entity linking (or Normalization) is an essential task in text mining
    that maps the entity mentions in the medical text to standard entities in a given
    Knowledge Base (KB). This task is of great importance in the medical domain. It
    can also be used for merging different medical and clinical ontologies. In this
    paper, we center around the problem of disease linking or normalization. This
    task is executed in two phases: candidate generation and candidate scoring. In
    this paper, we present an approach to rank the candidate Knowledge Base entries
    based on their similarity with disease mention. We make use of the Triplet Network
    for candidate ranking. While the existing methods have used carefully generated
    sieves and external resources for candidate generation, we introduce a robust
    and portable candidate generation scheme that does not make use of the hand-crafted
    rules. Experimental results on the standard benchmark NCBI disease dataset demonstrate
    that our system outperforms the prior methods by a significant margin.'

  abstract: 'Many clinical information needs can be stated as why-questions. The answers
    to them represent important clinical reasoning and justification. Clinical notes
    are a rich source for such why-question answering (why-QA). However, there are
    few dedicated corpora, and little is known about the characteristics of clinical
    why-QA narratives. To address this gap, the study performed manual annotation
    of 277 sentences containing explicit why-QA cues and summarized their quantitative
    and qualitative properties. The contributions are: 1) sharing a seed corpus that
    can be used for various QA-related training purposes, 2) adding to our knowledge
    about the diversity and distribution of clinical why-QA contents.'

  abstract: Population age information is an essential characteristic of clinical
    trials. In this paper, we focus on extracting minimum and maximum (min/max) age
    values for the study samples from clinical research articles. Specifically, we
    investigate the use of a neural network model for question answering to address
    this information extraction task. The min/max age QA model is trained on the massive
    structured clinical study records from ClinicalTrials.gov. For each article, based
    on multiple min and max age values extracted from the QA model, we predict both
    actual min/max age values for the study samples and filter out non-factual age
    expressions. Our system improves the results over (i) a passage retrieval based
    IE system and (ii) a CRF-based system by a large margin when evaluated on an annotated
    dataset consisting of 50 research papers on smoking cessation.

  abstract: Recently natural language processing (NLP) tools have been developed to
    identify and extract salient risk indicators in electronic health records (EHRs).
    Sentiment analysis, although widely used in non-medical areas for improving decision
    making, has been studied minimally in the clinical setting. In this study, we
    undertook, to our knowledge, the first domain adaptation of sentiment analysis
    to psychiatric EHRs by defining psychiatric clinical sentiment, performing an
    annotation project, and evaluating multiple sentence-level sentiment machine learning
    (ML) models. Results indicate that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools fail
    in identifying clinically positive or negative polarity, and that the definition
    of clinical sentiment that we provide is learnable with relatively small amounts
    of training data. This project is an initial step towards further refining sentiment
    analysis methods for clinical use. Our long-term objective is to incorporate the
    results of this project as part of a machine learning model that predicts inpatient
    readmission risk. We hope that this work will initiate a discussion concerning
    domain adaptation of sentiment analysis to the clinical setting.

  abstract: 'Word embeddings are representations of words in a dense vector space.
    Although they are not recent phenomena in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they
    have gained momentum after the recent developments of neural methods and Word2Vec.
    Regarding their applications in medical and clinical NLP, they are invaluable
    resources when training in-domain named entity recognition systems, classifiers
    or taggers, for instance. Thus, the development of tailored word embeddings for
    medical NLP is of great interest. However, we identified a gap in the literature
    which we aim to fill in this paper: the availability of embeddings for medical
    NLP in Spanish, as well as a standardized form of intrinsic evaluation. Since
    most work has been done for English, some established datasets for intrinsic evaluation
    are already available. In this paper, we show the steps we employed to adapt such
    datasets for the first time to Spanish, of particular relevance due to the considerable
    volume of EHRs in this language, as well as the creation of in-domain medical
    word embeddings for the Spanish using the state-of-the-art FastText model. We
    performed intrinsic evaluation with our adapted datasets, as well as extrinsic
    evaluation with a named entity recognition systems using a baseline embedding
    of general-domain. Both experiments proved that our embeddings are suitable for
    use in medical NLP in the Spanish language, and are more accurate than general-domain
    ones.'

  abstract: 'Electronic health records (EHRs) are notorious for reducing the face-to-face
    time with patients while increasing the screen-time for clinicians leading to
    burnout. This is especially problematic for psychiatry care in which maintaining
    consistent eye-contact and non-verbal cues are just as important as the spoken
    words. In this ongoing work, we explore the feasibility of automatically generating
    psychiatric EHR case notes from digital transcripts of doctor-patient conversation
    using a two-step approach: (1) predicting semantic topics for segments of transcripts
    using supervised machine learning, and (2) generating formal text of those segments
    using natural language processing. Through a series of preliminary experimental
    results obtained through a collection of synthetic and real-life transcripts,
    we demonstrate the viability of this approach.'

  abstract: Past prescriptions constitute a central element in patient records. These
    are often written in an unstructured and brief form. Extracting information from
    such prescriptions enables the development of automated processes in the medical
    data mining field. This paper presents a Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) based
    approach to extract relevant information from prescriptions. We focus on Finnish
    language prescriptions and make use of Finnish language specific features. Our
    labeling accuracy is 95%, which compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art
    in English language prescriptions. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the
    first such work for the Finnish language.

  abstract: Distributed word vector spaces are considered hard to interpret which
    hinders the understanding of natural language processing (NLP) models. In this
    work, we introduce a new method to interpret arbitrary samples from a word vector
    space. To this end, we train a neural model to conceptualize word vectors, which
    means that it activates higher order concepts it recognizes in a given vector.
    Contrary to prior approaches, our model operates in the original vector space
    and is capable of learning non-linear relations between word vectors and concepts.
    Furthermore, we show that it produces considerably less entropic concept activation
    profiles than the popular cosine similarity.

  abstract: 'Analysis of word embedding properties to inform their use in downstream
    NLP tasks has largely been studied by assessing nearest neighbors. However, geometric
    properties of the continuous feature space contribute directly to the use of embedding
    features in downstream models, and are largely unexplored. We consider four properties
    of word embedding geometry, namely: position relative to the origin, distribution
    of features in the vector space, global pairwise distances, and local pairwise
    distances. We define a sequence of transformations to generate new embeddings
    that expose subsets of these properties to downstream models and evaluate change
    in task performance to understand the contribution of each property to NLP models.
    We transform publicly available pretrained embeddings from three popular toolkits
    (word2vec, GloVe, and FastText) and evaluate on a variety of intrinsic tasks,
    which model linguistic information in the vector space, and extrinsic tasks, which
    use vectors as input to machine learning models. We find that intrinsic evaluations
    are highly sensitive to absolute position, while extrinsic tasks rely primarily
    on local similarity. Our findings suggest that future embedding models and post-processing
    techniques should focus primarily on similarity to nearby points in vector space.'

  abstract: The stability of word embedding algorithms, i.e., the consistency of the
    word representations they reveal when trained repeatedly on the same data set,
    has recently raised concerns. We here compare word embedding algorithms on three
    corpora of different sizes, and evaluate both their stability and accuracy. We
    find strong evidence that down-sampling strategies (used as part of their training
    procedures) are particularly influential for the stability of SVD-PPMI-type embeddings.
    This finding seems to explain diverging reports on their stability and lead us
    to a simple modification which provides superior stability as well as accuracy
    on par with skip-gram embedding

    to study how well they capture the nuances of non-compositional data. Our results
    from a pool of word-, character-, and document-level embbedings suggest that Word2vec
    performs the best, followed by FastText and Infersent. Moreover, we find that
    recently-proposed contextualised embedding models such as Bert and ELMo are not
    adept at handling non-compositionality in multiword expressions.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether multilingual neural translation
    models learn stronger semantic abstractions of sentences than bilingual ones.
    We test this hypotheses by measuring the perplexity of such models when applied
    to paraphrases of the source language. The intuition is that an encoder produces
    better representations if a decoder is capable of recognizing synonymous sentences
    in the same language even though the model is never trained for that task. In
    our setup, we add 16 different auxiliary languages to a bidirectional bilingual
    baseline model (English-French) and test it with in-domain and out-of-domain paraphrases
    in English. The results show that the perplexity is significantly reduced in each
    of the cases, indicating that meaning can be grounded in translation. This is
    further supported by a study on paraphrase generation that we also include at
    the end of the paper.

  abstract: Downstream evaluation of pretrained word embeddings is expensive, more
    so for tasks where current state of the art models are very large architectures.
    Intrinsic evaluation using word similarity or analogy datasets, on the other hand,
    suffers from several disadvantages. We propose a novel intrinsic evaluation task
    employing large word association datasets (particularly the Small World of Words
    dataset). We observe correlations not just between performances on SWOW-8500 and
    previously proposed intrinsic tasks of word similarity prediction, but also with
    downstream tasks (eg. Text Classification and Natural Language Inference). Most
    importantly, we report better confidence intervals for scores on our word association
    task, with no fall in correlation with downstream performance.

  abstract: In clinical assessment of people with aphasia, impairment in the ability
    to recall and produce words for objects (anomia) is assessed using a confrontation
    naming task, where a target stimulus is viewed and a corresponding label is spoken
    by the participant. Vector space word embedding models have had inital results
    in assessing semantic similarity of target-production pairs in order to automate
    scoring of this task; however, the resulting models are also highly dependent
    upon training parameters. To select an optimal family of models, we fit a beta
    regression model to the distribution of performance metrics on a set of 2,880
    grid search models and evaluate the resultant first- and second-order effects
    to explore how parameterization affects model performance. Comparing to SimLex-999,
    we show that clinical data can be used in an evaluation task with comparable optimal
    parameter settings as standard NLP evaluation datasets.

  abstract: Commonsense reasoning is a critical AI capability, but it is difficult
    to construct challenging datasets that test common sense. Recent neural question
    answering systems, based on large pre-trained models of language, have already
    achieved near-human-level performance on commonsense knowledge benchmarks. These
    systems do not possess human-level common sense, but are able to exploit limitations
    of the datasets to achieve human-level scores. We introduce the CODAH dataset,
    an adversarially-constructed evaluation dataset for testing common sense. CODAH
    forms a challenging extension to the recently-proposed SWAG dataset, which tests
    commonsense knowledge using sentence-completion questions that describe situations
    observed in video. To produce a more difficult dataset, we introduce a novel procedure
    for question acquisition in which workers author questions designed to target
    weaknesses of state-of-the-art neural question answering systems. Workers are
    rewarded for submissions that models fail to answer correctly both before and
    after fine-tuning (in cross-validation). We create 2.8k questions via this procedure
    and evaluate the performance of multiple state-of-the-art question answering systems
    on our dataset. We observe a significant gap between human performance, which
    is 95.3%, and the performance of the best baseline accuracy of 65.3% by the OpenAI
    GPT model.

  abstract: "Nearest neighbors in word embedding models are commonly observed to be\
    \ semantically similar, but the relations between them can vary greatly. We investigate\
    \ the extent to which word embedding models preserve syntactic interchangeability,\
    \ as reflected by distances between word vectors, and the effect of hyper-parameters\u2014\
    context window size in particular. We use part of speech (POS) as a proxy for\
    \ syntactic interchangeability, as generally speaking, words with the same POS\
    \ are syntactically valid in the same contexts. We also investigate the relationship\
    \ between interchangeability and similarity as judged by commonly-used word similarity\
    \ benchmarks, and correlate the result with the performance of word embedding\
    \ models on these benchmarks. Our results will inform future research and applications\
    \ in the selection of word embedding model, suggesting a principle for an appropriate\
    \ selection of the context window size parameter depending on the use-case."

  abstract: This paper evaluates morphology-based embeddings for English and Russian
    languages. Despite the interest and introduction of several morphology based word
    embedding models in the past and acclaimed performance improvements on word similarity
    and language modeling tasks, in our experiments, we did not observe any stable
    preference over two of our baseline models - SkipGram and FastText. The performance
    exhibited by morphological embeddings is the average of the two baselines mentioned
    above.

  abstract: Contextualized word embeddings derived from pre-trained language models
    (LMs) show significant improvements on downstream NLP tasks. Pre-training on domain-specific
    corpora, such as biomedical articles, further improves their performance. In this
    paper, we conduct probing experiments to determine what additional information
    is carried intrinsically by the in-domain trained contextualized embeddings. For
    this we use the pre-trained LMs as fixed feature extractors and restrict the downstream
    task models to not have additional sequence modeling layers. We compare BERT (Devlin
    et al. 2018), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) and BioELMo,
    a biomedical version of ELMo trained on 10M PubMed abstracts. Surprisingly, while
    fine-tuned BioBERT is better than BioELMo in biomedical NER and NLI tasks, as
    a fixed feature extractor BioELMo outperforms BioBERT in our probing tasks. We
    use visualization and nearest neighbor analysis to show that better encoding of
    entity-type and relational information leads to this superiority.

  abstract: This paper explores modern word embeddings in the context of sound symbolism.
    Using basic properties of the representations space one can construct semantic
    axes. A method is proposed to measure if the presence of individual sounds in
    a given word shifts its semantics of that word along a specific axis. It is shown
    that, in accordance with several experimental and statistical results, word embeddings
    capture symbolism for certain sounds.

  abstract: Naming and titling have been discussed in sociolinguistics as markers
    of status or solidarity. However, these functions have not been studied on a larger
    scale or for social media data. We collect a corpus of tweets mentioning presidents
    of six G20 countries by various naming forms. We show that naming variation relates
    to stance towards the president in a way that is suggestive of a framing effect
    mediated by respectfulness. This confirms sociolinguistic theory of naming and
    titling as markers of status.

  abstract: "Social scientists have recently turned to analyzing text using tools\
    \ from natural language processing like word embeddings to measure concepts like\
    \ ideology, bias, and affinity. However, word embeddings are difficult to use\
    \ in the regression framework familiar to social scientists: embeddings are are\
    \ neither identified, nor directly interpretable. I offer two advances on standard\
    \ embedding models to remedy these problems. First, I develop Bayesian Word Embeddings\
    \ with Automatic Relevance Determination priors, relaxing the assumption that\
    \ all embedding dimensions have equal weight. Second, I apply work identifying\
    \ latent variable models to anchor embeddings, identifying them, and making them\
    \ interpretable and usable in a regression. I then apply this model and anchoring\
    \ approach to two cases, the shift in internationalist rhetoric in the American\
    \ presidents\u2019 inaugural addresses, and the relationship between bellicosity\
    \ in American foreign policy decision-makers\u2019 deliberations. I find that\
    \ inaugural addresses became less internationalist after 1945, which goes against\
    \ the conventional wisdom, and that an increase in bellicosity is associated with\
    \ an increase in hostile actions by the United States, showing that elite deliberations\
    \ are not cheap talk, and helping confirm the validity of the model."

  abstract: "NLP naturally puts a primary focus on leveraging document language, occasionally\
    \ considering user attributes as supplemental. However, as we tackle more social\
    \ scientific tasks, it is possible user attributes might be of primary importance\
    \ and the document supplemental. Here, we systematically investigate the predictive\
    \ power of user-level features alone versus document-level features for document-level\
    \ tasks. We first show user attributes can sometimes carry more task-related information\
    \ than the document itself. For example, a tweet-level stance detection model\
    \ using only 13 user-level attributes (i.e. features that did not depend on the\
    \ specific tweet) was able to obtain a higher F1 than the top-performing SemEval\
    \ participant. We then consider multiple tasks and a wider range of user attributes,\
    \ showing the performance of strong document-only models can often be improved\
    \ (as in stance, sentiment, and sarcasm) with user attributes, particularly benefiting\
    \ tasks with stable \u201Ctrait-like\u201D outcomes (e.g. stance) most relative\
    \ to frequently changing \u201Cstate-like\u201D outcomes (e.g. sentiment). These\
    \ results not only support the growing work on integrating user factors into predictive\
    \ systems, but that some of our NLP tasks might be better cast primarily as user-level\
    \ (or human) tasks."

  abstract: "This work introduces a general method for automatically finding the locations\
    \ where political events in text occurred. Using a novel set of 8,000 labeled\
    \ sentences, I create a method to link automatically extracted events and locations\
    \ in text. The model achieves human level performance on the annotation task and\
    \ outperforms previous event geolocation systems. It can be applied to most event\
    \ extraction systems across geographic contexts. I formalize the event\u2013location\
    \ linking task, describe the neural network model, describe the potential uses\
    \ of such a system in political science, and demonstrate a workflow to answer\
    \ an open question on the role of conventional military offensives in causing\
    \ civilian casualties in the Syrian civil war."

    \ on the Net report, more than half the world\u2019s Internet users now live in\
    \ a place where the Internet is censored or restricted. China has built the world\u2019\
    s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. In this paper, we\
    \ describe a new corpus of censored and uncensored social media tweets from a\
    \ Chinese microblogging website, Sina Weibo, collected by tracking posts that\
    \ mention \u2018sensitive\u2019 topics or authored by \u2018sensitive\u2019 users.\
    \ We use this corpus to build a neural network classifier to predict censorship.\
    \ Our model performs with a 88.50% accuracy using only linguistic features. We\
    \ discuss these features in detail and hypothesize that they could potentially\

  abstract: "Cognitive tests have traditionally resorted to standardizing testing\
    \ materials in the name of equality and because of the onerous nature of creating\
    \ test items. This approach ignores participants\u2019 diverse language experiences\
    \ that potentially significantly affect testing outcomes. Here, we seek to explain\
    \ our prior finding of significant performance differences on two cognitive tests\
    \ (reading span and SPiN) between clusters of participants based on their media\
    \ consumption. Here, we model the language contained in these media sources using\
    \ an LSTM trained on corpora of each cluster\u2019s media sources to predict target\
    \ words. We also model semantic similarity of test items with each cluster\u2019\
    s corpus using skip-thought vectors. We find robust, significant correlations\
    \ between performance on the SPiN test and the LSTMs and skip-thought models we\
    \ present here, but not the reading span test."

  abstract: This paper proposes a method for identifying and studying viral moments
    or highlights during a political debate. Using a combined strategy of time series
    analysis and domain adapted word embeddings, this study provides an in-depth analysis
    of several key moments during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. First, a time
    series outlier analysis is used to identify key moments during the debate. These
    moments had to result in a long-term shift in attention towards either Hillary
    Clinton or Donald Trump (i.e., a transient change outlier or an intervention,
    resulting in a permanent change in the time series). To assess whether these moments
    also resulted in a discursive shift, two corpora are produced for each potential
    viral moment (a pre-viral corpus and post-viral corpus). A domain adaptation layer
    learns weights to combine a generic and domain-specific (DS) word embedding into
    a domain adapted (DA) embedding. Words are then classified using a generic encoder+
    classifier framework that relies on these word embeddings as inputs. Results suggest
    that both Clinton and Trump were able to induce discourse-shifting viral moments,
    though the former is much better at producing a topically-specific discursive
    shift.

  abstract: In group decision-making, the nuanced process of conflict and resolution
    that leads to consensus formation is closely tied to the quality of decisions
    made. Behavioral scientists rarely have rich access to process variables, though,
    as unstructured discussion transcripts are difficult to analyze. Here, we define
    ways for NLP researchers to contribute to the study of groups and teams. We introduce
    three tasks alongside a large new corpus of over 400,000 group debates on Wikipedia.
    We describe the tasks and their importance, then provide baselines showing that
    BERT contextualized word embeddings consistently outperform other language representations.

  abstract: Online social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are increasingly
    facing criticism for polarization of users. One particular aspect which has caught
    the attention of various critics is presence of users in echo chambers - a situation
    wherein users are exposed mostly to the opinions which are in sync with their
    own views. In this paper, we perform a sociolinguistic study by comparing the
    tweets of users in echo chambers with the tweets of users not in echo chambers
    with similar levels of polarity on a broad topic. Specifically, we carry out a
    comparative analysis of tweet structure, lexical choices, and focus issues, and
    provide possible explanations for the results.

  abstract: "News consumption exhibits an increasing shift towards online sources,\
    \ which bring platforms such as YouTube more into focus. Thus, the distribution\
    \ of politically loaded news is easier, receives more attention, but also raises\
    \ the concern of forming isolated ideological communities. Understanding how such\
    \ news is communicated and received is becoming increasingly important. To expand\
    \ our understanding in this domain, we apply a linguistic temporal trajectory\
    \ analysis to analyze sentiment patterns in English-language videos from news\
    \ channels on YouTube. We examine transcripts from videos distributed through\
    \ eight channels with pro-left and pro-right political leanings. Using unsupervised\
    \ clustering, we identify seven different sentiment patterns in the transcripts.\
    \ We found that the use of two sentiment patterns differed significantly depending\
    \ on political leaning. Furthermore, we used predictive models to examine how\
    \ different sentiment patterns relate to video popularity and if they differ depending\
    \ on the channel\u2019s political leaning. No clear relations between sentiment\
    \ patterns and popularity were found. However, results indicate, that videos from\
    \ pro-right news channels are more popular and that a negative sentiment further\
    \ increases that popularity, when sentiments are averaged for each video."

  abstract: Political discourse on social media microblogs, specifically Twitter,
    has become an undeniable part of mainstream U.S. politics. Given the length constraint
    of tweets, politicians must carefully word their statements to ensure their message
    is understood by their intended audience. This constraint often eliminates the
    context of the tweet, making automatic analysis of social media political discourse
    a difficult task. To overcome this challenge, we propose simultaneous modeling
    of high-level abstractions of political language, such as political slogans and
    framing strategies, with abstractions of how politicians behave on Twitter. These
    behavioral abstractions can be further leveraged as forms of supervision in order
    to increase prediction accuracy, while reducing the burden of annotation. In this
    work, we use Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) to build relational models to capture
    the similarities in language and behavior that obfuscate political messages on
    Twitter. When combined, these descriptors reveal the moral foundations underlying
    the discourse of U.S. politicians online, across differing governing administrations,
    showing how party talking points remain cohesive or change over time.

  abstract: Unilateral legal contracts, such as terms of service, play a substantial
    role in modern digital life. However, few read these documents before accepting
    the terms within, as they are too long and the language too complicated. We propose
    the task of summarizing such legal documents in plain English, which would enable
    users to have a better understanding of the terms they are accepting. We propose
    an initial dataset of legal text snippets paired with summaries written in plain
    English. We verify the quality of these summaries manually, and show that they
    involve heavy abstraction, compression, and simplification. Initial experiments
    show that unsupervised extractive summarization methods do not perform well on
    this task due to the level of abstraction and style differences. We conclude with
    a call for resource and technique development for simplification and style transfer
    for legal language.

  abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that judicial and administrative decisions
    can be predicted by machine-learning models trained on prior decisions. However,
    to have any practical application, these predictions must be explainable, which
    in turn requires modeling a rich set of features. Such approaches face a roadblock
    if the knowledge engineering required to create these features is not scalable.
    We present an approach to developing a feature-rich corpus of administrative rulings
    about domain name disputes, an approach which leverages a small amount of manual
    annotation and prototypical patterns present in the case documents to automatically
    extend feature labels to the entire corpus. To demonstrate the feasibility of
    this approach, we report results from systems trained on this dataset.

  abstract: Contract language is repetitive (Anderson and Manns, 2017), but so is
    all language (Zipf, 1949). In this paper, we measure the extent to which contract
    language in English is repetitive compared with the language of other English
    language corpora. Contracts have much smaller vocabulary sizes compared with similarly
    sized non-contract corpora across multiple contract types, contain 1/5th as many
    hapax legomena, pattern differently on a log-log plot, use fewer pronouns, and
    contain sentences that are about 20% more similar to one another than in other
    corpora. These suggest that the study of contracts in natural language processing
    controls for some linguistic phenomena and allows for more in depth study of others.

  abstract: In this paper, we examined several algorithms to detect sentence boundaries
    in legal text. Legal text presents challenges for sentence tokenizers because
    of the variety of punctuations and syntax of legal text. Out-of-the-box algorithms
    perform poorly on legal text affecting further analysis of the text. A novel and
    domain-specific approach is needed to detect sentence boundaries to further analyze
    legal text. We present the results of our investigation in this paper.

  abstract: This paper describes a dataset and baseline systems for linking paragraphs
    from court cases to clauses or amendments in the US Constitution. We implement
    a rule-based system, a linear model, and a neural architecture for matching pairs
    of paragraphs, taking training data from online databases in a distantly-supervised
    fashion. In experiments on a manually-annotated evaluation set, we find that our
    proposed neural system outperforms a rules-driven baseline. Qualitatively, this
    performance gap seems largest for abstract or indirect links between documents,
    which suggests that our system might be useful for answering political science
    and legal research questions or discovering novel links. We release the dataset
    along with the manually-annotated evaluation set to foster future work.

  abstract: Dockets contain a wealth of information for planning a litigation strategy,
    but the information is locked up in semi-structured text. Manually deriving the
    outcomes for each party (e.g., settlement, verdict) would be very labor intensive.
    Having such information available for every past court case, however, would be
    very useful for developing a strategy because it potentially reveals tendencies
    and trends of judges and courts and the opposing counsel. We used Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning methods allowing us to scale the
    automatic analysis of millions of US federal court dockets. The automatically
    extracted information is fed into a Litigation Analytics tool that is used by
    lawyers to plan how they approach concrete litigations.

  abstract: This paper conducts a comparative study on the performance of various
    machine learning approaches for classifying judgments into legal areas. Using
    a novel dataset of 6,227 Singapore Supreme Court judgments, we investigate how
    state-of-the-art NLP methods compare against traditional statistical models when
    applied to a legal corpus that comprised few but lengthy documents. All approaches
    tested, including topic model, word embedding, and language model-based classifiers,
    performed well with as little as a few hundred judgments. However, more work needs
    to be done to optimize state-of-the-art methods for the legal domain.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we extend the persona-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
    neural network conversation model to a multi-turn dialogue scenario by modifying
    the state-of-the-art hredGAN architecture to simultaneously capture utterance
    attributes such as speaker identity, dialogue topic, speaker sentiments and so
    on. The proposed system, phredGAN has a persona-based HRED generator (PHRED) and
    a conditional discriminator. We also explore two approaches to accomplish the
    conditional discriminator: (1) phredGANa, a system that passes the attribute representation
    as an additional input into a traditional adversarial discriminator, and (2) phredGANd,
    a dual discriminator system which in addition to the adversarial discriminator,
    collaboratively predicts the attribute(s) that generated the input utterance.
    To demonstrate the superior performance of phredGAN over the persona Seq2Seq model,
    we experiment with two conversational datasets, the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC)
    and TV series transcripts from the Big Bang Theory and Friends. Performance comparison
    is made with respect to a variety of quantitative measures as well as crowd-sourced
    human evaluation. We also explore the trade-offs from using either variant of
    phredGAN on datasets with many but weak attribute modalities (such as with Big
    Bang Theory and Friends) and ones with few but strong attribute modalities (customer-agent
    interactions in Ubuntu dataset).'

  abstract: In open-domain dialogue systems, generative approaches have attracted
    much attention for response generation. However, existing methods are heavily
    plagued by generating safe responses and unnatural responses. To alleviate these
    two problems, we propose a novel framework named Dual Adversarial Learning(DAL)
    for high-quality response generation. DAL innovatively utilizes the duality between
    query generation and response generation to avoid safe responses and increase
    the diversity of the generated responses. Additionally, DAL uses adversarial learning
    to mimic human judges and guides the system to generate natural responses. Experimental
    results demonstrate that DAL effectively improves both diversity and overall quality
    of the generated responses. DAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding
    automatic metrics and human evaluations.

  abstract: We show that plain ROUGE F1 scores are not ideal for comparing current
    neural systems which on average produce different lengths. This is due to a non-linear
    pattern between ROUGE F1 and summary length. To alleviate the effect of length
    during evaluation, we have proposed a new method which normalizes the ROUGE F1
    scores of a system by that of a random system with same average output length.
    A pilot human evaluation has shown that humans prefer short summaries in terms
    of the verbosity of a summary but overall consider longer summaries to be of higher
    quality. While human evaluations are more expensive in time and resources, it
    is clear that normalization, such as the one we proposed for automatic evaluation,
    will make human evaluations more meaningful.

  abstract: We show that BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a Markov random field language
    model. This formulation gives way to a natural procedure to sample sentences from
    BERT. We generate from BERT and find that it can produce high quality, fluent
    generations. Compared to the generations of a traditional left-to-right language
    model, BERT generates sentences that are more diverse but of slightly worse quality.

  abstract: Neural text simplification has gained increasing attention in the NLP
    community thanks to recent advancements in deep sequence-to-sequence learning.
    Most recent efforts with such a data-demanding paradigm have dealt with the English
    language, for which sizeable training datasets are currently available to deploy
    competitive models. Similar improvements on less resource-rich languages are conditioned
    either to intensive manual work to create training data, or to the design of effective
    automatic generation techniques to bypass the data acquisition bottleneck. Inspired
    by the machine translation field, in which synthetic parallel pairs generated
    from monolingual data yield significant improvements to neural models, in this
    paper we exploit large amounts of heterogeneous data to automatically select simple
    sentences, which are then used to create synthetic simplification pairs. We also
    evaluate other solutions, such as oversampling and the use of external word embeddings
    to be fed to the neural simplification system. Our approach is evaluated on Italian
    and Spanish, for which few thousand gold sentence pairs are available. The results
    show that these techniques yield performance improvements over a baseline sequence-to-sequence
    configuration.

  abstract: Semi-supervised learning is an efficient way to improve performance for
    natural language processing systems. In this work, we propose Para-SSL, a scheme
    to generate candidate utterances using paraphrasing and methods from semi-supervised
    learning. In order to perform paraphrase generation in the context of a dialog
    system, we automatically extract paraphrase pairs to create a paraphrase corpus.
    Using this data, we build a paraphrase generation system and perform one-to-many
    generation, followed by a validation step to select only the utterances with good
    quality. The paraphrase-based semi-supervised learning is applied to five functionalities
    in a natural language understanding system. Our proposed method for semi-supervised
    learning using paraphrase generation does not require user utterances and can
    be applied prior to releasing a new functionality to a system. Experiments show
    that we can achieve up to 19% of relative slot error reduction without an access
    to user utterances, and up to 35% when leveraging live traffic utterances.

    \ languages. The decoder is shared for the two translation directions. Next, a\
    \ GAN is trained to generate synthetic \u2018code\u2019 mimicking the languages\u2019\

  abstract: Generated output from neural NLG systems often contain errors such as
    hallucination, repetition or contradiction. This work focuses on designing a symbolic
    intermediate representation to be used in multi-stage neural generation with the
    intention of reducing the frequency of failed outputs. We show that surface realization
    from this intermediate representation is of high quality and when the full system
    is applied to the E2E dataset it outperforms the winner of the E2E challenge.
    Furthermore, by breaking out the surface realization step from typically end-to-end
    neural systems, we also provide a framework for non-neural based content selection
    and planning systems to potentially take advantage of semi-supervised pretraining
    of neural surface realization models.

  abstract: 'We introduce a simple method for text style transfer that frames style
    transfer as denoising: we synthesize a noisy corpus and treat the source style
    as a noisy version of the target style. To control for aspects such as preserving
    meaning while modifying style, we propose a reranking approach in the data synthesis
    phase. We evaluate our method on three novel style transfer tasks: transferring
    between British and American varieties, text genres (formal vs. casual), and lyrics
    from different musical genres. By measuring style transfer quality, meaning preservation,
    and the fluency of generated outputs, we demonstrate that our method is able both
    to produce high-quality output while maintaining the flexibility to suggest syntactically
    rich stylistic edits.'

  abstract: Despite advances in open-domain dialogue systems, automatic evaluation
    of such systems is still a challenging problem. Traditional reference-based metrics
    such as BLEU are ineffective because there could be many valid responses for a
    given context that share no common words with reference responses. A recent work
    proposed Referenced metric and Unreferenced metric Blended Evaluation Routine
    (RUBER) to combine a learning-based metric, which predicts relatedness between
    a generated response and a given query, with reference-based metric; it showed
    high correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we explore using contextualized
    word embeddings to compute more accurate relatedness scores, thus better evaluation
    metrics. Experiments show that our evaluation metrics outperform RUBER, which
    is trained on static embeddings.

  abstract: "Text generation is an important Natural Language Processing task with\
    \ various applications. Although several metrics have already been introduced\
    \ to evaluate the text generation methods, each of them has its own shortcomings.\
    \ The most widely used metrics such as BLEU only consider the quality of generated\
    \ sentences and neglecting their diversity. For example, repeatedly generation\
    \ of only one high quality sentence would result in a high BLEU score. On the\
    \ other hand, the more recent metric introduced to evaluate the diversity of generated\
    \ texts known as Self-BLEU ignores the quality of generated texts. In this paper,\
    \ we propose metrics to evaluate both the quality and diversity simultaneously\
    \ by approximating the distance of the learned generative model and the real data\
    \ distribution. For this purpose, we first introduce a metric that approximates\
    \ this distance using n-gram based measures. Then, a feature-based measure which\
    \ is based on a recent highly deep model trained on a large text corpus called\
    \ BERT is introduced. Finally, for oracle training mode in which the generator\u02BC\
    s density can also be calculated, we propose to use the distance measures between\
    \ the corresponding explicit distributions. Eventually, the most popular and recent\
    \ text generation models are evaluated using both the existing and the proposed\
    \ metrics and the preferences of the proposed metrics are determined."

  abstract: Characters are a key element of narrative and so character identification
    plays an important role in automatic narrative understanding. Unfortunately, most
    prior work that incorporates character identification is not built upon a clear,
    theoretically grounded concept of character. They either take character identification
    for granted (e.g., using simple heuristics on referring expressions), or rely
    on simplified definitions that do not capture important distinctions between characters
    and other referents in the story. Prior approaches have also been rather complicated,
    relying, for example, on predefined case bases or ontologies. In this paper we
    propose a narratologically grounded definition of character for discussion at
    the workshop, and also demonstrate a preliminary yet straightforward supervised
    machine learning model with a small set of features that performs well on two
    corpora. The most important of the two corpora is a set of 46 Russian folktales,
    on which the model achieves an F1 of 0.81. Error analysis suggests that features
    relevant to the plot will be necessary for further improvements in performance.

  abstract: "Early proposals for the deep understanding of natural language text advocated\
    \ an approach of \u201Cinterpretation as abduction,\u201D where the meaning of\
    \ a text was derived as an explanation that logically entailed the input words,\
    \ given a knowledge base of lexical and commonsense axioms. While most subsequent\
    \ NLP research has instead pursued statistical and data-driven methods, the approach\
    \ of interpretation as abduction has seen steady advancements in both theory and\
    \ software implementations. In this paper, we summarize advances in deriving the\
    \ logical form of the text, encoding commonsense knowledge, and technologies for\
    \ scalable abductive reasoning. We then explore the application of these advancements\
    \ to the deep understanding of a paragraph of news text, where the subtle meaning\
    \ of words and phrases are resolved by backward chaining on a knowledge base of\
    \ 80 hand-authored axioms."

  abstract: In this paper, we advocate the use of Message Sequence Chart (MSC) as
    a knowledge representation to capture and visualize multi-actor interactions and
    their temporal ordering. We propose algorithms to automatically extract an MSC
    from a history narrative. For a given narrative, we first identify verbs which
    indicate interactions and then use dependency parsing and Semantic Role Labelling
    based approaches to identify senders (initiating actors) and receivers (other
    actors involved) for these interaction verbs. As a final step in MSC extraction,
    we employ a state-of-the art algorithm to temporally re-order these interactions.
    Our evaluation on multiple publicly available narratives shows improvements over
    four baselines.

  abstract: Story infilling involves predicting words to go into a missing span from
    a story. This challenging task has the potential to transform interactive tools
    for creative writing. However, state-of-the-art conditional language models have
    trouble balancing fluency and coherence with novelty and diversity. We address
    this limitation with a hierarchical model which first selects a set of rare words
    and then generates text conditioned on that set. By relegating the high entropy
    task of picking rare words to a word-sampling model, the second-stage model conditioned
    on those words can achieve high fluency and coherence by searching for likely
    sentences, without sacrificing diversity.

  abstract: "To understand historical texts, we must be aware that language\u2014\
    including the emotional connotation attached to words\u2014changes over time.\
    \ In this paper, we aim at estimating the emotion which is associated with a given\
    \ word in former language stages of English and German. Emotion is represented\
    \ following the popular Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) annotation scheme. While\
    \ being more expressive than polarity alone, existing word emotion induction methods\
    \ are typically not suited for addressing it. To overcome this limitation, we\
    \ present adaptations of two popular algorithms to VAD. To measure their effectiveness\
    \ in diachronic settings, we present the first gold standard for historical word\
    \ emotions, which was created by scholars with proficiency in the respective language\
    \ stages and covers both English and German. In contrast to claims in previous\
    \ work, our findings indicate that hand-selecting small sets of seed words with\
    \ supposedly stable emotional meaning is actually harm- rather than helpful."

  abstract: This article focuses on the problem of identifying articles and recovering
    their text from within and across newspaper pages when OCR just delivers one text
    file per page. We frame the task as a segmentation plus clustering step. Our results
    on a sample of 1912 New York Tribune magazine shows that performing the clustering
    based on similarities computed with word embeddings outperforms a similarity measure
    based on character n-grams and words. Furthermore, the automatic segmentation
    based on the text results in low scores, due to the low quality of some OCRed
    documents.

    \ literary studies has instead undergone a process of \u201Cscientization\u201D\
    , adopting linguistic behavior similar to the sciences. We test this using methods\
    \ based on information theory, comparing a corpus of literary studies articles\
    \ (around 63,400) with a corpus of standard English and scientific English respectively.\
    \ We show evidence for \u201Cscientization\u201D effects in literary studies,\
    \ though at a more muted level than scientific English, suggesting that literary\
    \ studies occupies a middle ground with respect to standard English in the larger\
    \ space of academic disciplines. More generally, our methodology can be applied\
    \ to investigate the social positioning and development of language use across\

  abstract: "According to the literary theory of Mikhail Bakhtin, a dialogic novel\
    \ is one in which characters speak in their own distinct voices, rather than serving\
    \ as mouthpieces for their authors. We use text classification to determine which\
    \ authors best achieve dialogism, looking at a corpus of plays from the late nineteenth\
    \ and early twentieth centuries. We find that the SAGE model of text generation,\
    \ which highlights deviations from a background lexical distribution, is an effective\
    \ method of weighting the words of characters\u2019 utterances. Our results show\
    \ that it is indeed possible to distinguish characters by their speech in the\
    \ plays of canonical writers such as George Bernard Shaw, whereas characters are\
    \ clustered more closely in the works of lesser-known playwrights."

  abstract: This paper presents a modular NLP pipeline for the creation of a parallel
    literature corpus, followed by annotation transfer from the source to the target
    language. The test case we use to evaluate our pipeline is the automatic transfer
    of quote and speaker mention annotations from English to German. We evaluate the
    different components of the pipeline and discuss challenges specific to literary
    texts. Our experiments show that after applying a reasonable amount of semi-automatic
    postprocessing we can obtain high-quality aligned and annotated resources for
    a new language.

  abstract: Classification of texts by genre is an important application of natural
    language processing to literary corpora but remains understudied for premodern
    and non-English traditions. We develop a stylometric feature set for ancient Greek
    that enables identification of texts as prose or verse. The set contains over
    20 primarily syntactic features, which are calculated according to custom, language-specific
    heuristics. Using these features, we classify almost all surviving classical Greek
    literature as prose or verse with >97% accuracy and F1 score, and further classify
    a selection of the verse texts into the traditional genres of epic and drama.

  abstract: In the Humanities and Social Sciences, there is increasing interest in
    approaches to information extraction, prediction, intelligent linkage, and dimension
    reduction applicable to large text corpora. With approaches in these fields being
    grounded in traditional statistical techniques, the need arises for frameworks
    whereby advanced NLP techniques such as topic modelling may be incorporated within
    classical methodologies. This paper provides a classical, supervised, statistical
    learning framework for prediction from text, using topic models as a data reduction
    method and the topics themselves as predictors, alongside typical statistical
    tools for predictive modelling. We apply this framework in a Social Sciences context
    (applied animal behaviour) as well as a Humanities context (narrative analysis)
    as examples of this framework. The results show that topic regression models perform
    comparably to their much less efficient equivalents that use individual words
    as predictors.

  abstract: This paper studies the use of NMT (neural machine translation) as a normalization
    method for an early English letter corpus. The corpus has previously been normalized
    so that only less frequent deviant forms are left out without normalization. This
    paper discusses different methods for improving the normalization of these deviant
    forms by using different approaches. Adding features to the training data is found
    to be unhelpful, but using a lexicographical resource to filter the top candidates
    produced by the NMT model together with lemmatization improves results.

  abstract: 'This work considers a task from traditional literary criticism: annotating
    a structured, composite document with information about its sources. We take the
    Documentary Hypothesis, a prominent theory regarding the composition of the first
    five books of the Hebrew bible, extract stylistic features designed to avoid bias
    or overfitting, and train several classification models. Our main result is that
    the recently-introduced graph convolutional network architecture outperforms structurally-uninformed
    models. We also find that including information about the granularity of text
    spans is a crucial ingredient when employing hidden layers, in contrast to simple
    logistic regression. We perform error analysis at several levels, noting how some
    characteristic limitations of the models and simple features lead to misclassifications,
    and conclude with an overview of future work.'

  abstract: "We have created two sets of labels for Hafez (1315-1390) poems, using\
    \ unsupervised learning. Our labels are the only semantic clustering alternative\
    \ to the previously existing, hand-labeled, gold-standard classification of Hafez\
    \ poems, to be used for literary research. We have cross-referenced, measured\
    \ and analyzed the agreements of our clustering labels with Houman\u2019s chronological\
    \ classes. Our features are based on topic modeling and word embeddings. We also\
    \ introduced a similarity of similarities\u2019 features, we called homothetic\
    \ clustering approach that proved effective, in case of Hafez\u2019s small corpus\
    \ of ghazals2. Although all our experiments showed different clusters when compared\
    \ with Houman\u2019s classes, we think they were valid in their own right to have\
    \ provided further insights, and have proved useful as a contrasting alternative\
    \ to Houman\u2019s classes. Our homothetic clusterer and its feature design and\
    \ engineering framework can be used for further semantic analysis of Hafez\u2019\
    s poetry and other similar literary research."

    for archival multimedia material that appear in different media, such as text,
    audio, image, and video. The primary goal of CLAMS is: (1) to develop an interchange
    format between multimodal metadata generation tools to ensure interoperability
    between tools; (2) to provide users with a portable, user-friendly workflow engine
    to chain selected tools to extract meaningful analyses; and (3) to create a public
    software development kit (SDK) for developers that eases deployment of analysis
    tools within the CLAMS platform. CLAMS is designed to help archives and libraries
    enrich the metadata associated with their mass-digitized multimedia collections,
    that would otherwise be largely unsearchable.'

  abstract: 'Whitespace errors are common to digitized archives. This paper describes
    a lightweight unsupervised technique for recovering the original whitespace. Our
    approach is based on count statistics from Google n-grams, which are converted
    into a likelihood ratio test computed from interpolated trigram and bigram probabilities.
    To evaluate this approach, we annotate a small corpus of whitespace errors in
    a digitized corpus of newspapers from the 19th century United States. Our technique
    identifies and corrects most whitespace errors while introducing a minimal amount
    of oversegmentation: it achieves 77% recall at a false positive rate of less than
    1%, and 91% recall at a false positive rate of less than 3%.'

  abstract: "The detection of allusive text reuse is particularly challenging due\
    \ to the sparse evidence on which allusive references rely \u2014 commonly based\
    \ on none or very few shared words. Arguably, lexical semantics can be resorted\
    \ to since uncovering semantic relations between words has the potential to increase\
    \ the support underlying the allusion and alleviate the lexical sparsity. A further\
    \ obstacle is the lack of evaluation benchmark corpora, largely due to the highly\
    \ interpretative character of the annotation process. In the present paper, we\
    \ aim to elucidate the feasibility of automated allusion detection. We approach\
    \ the matter from an Information Retrieval perspective in which referencing texts\
    \ act as queries and referenced texts as relevant documents to be retrieved, and\
    \ estimate the difficulty of benchmark corpus compilation by a novel inter-annotator\
    \ agreement study on query segmentation. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent\
    \ the integration of lexical semantic information derived from distributional\
    \ models and ontologies can aid retrieving cases of allusive reuse. The results\
    \ show that (i) despite low agreement scores, using manual queries considerably\
    \ improves retrieval performance with respect to a windowing approach, and that\
    \ (ii) retrieval performance can be moderately boosted with distributional semantics."

  abstract: The increased demand for structured scientific knowledge has attracted
    considerable attention in extracting scientific relation from the ever growing
    scientific publications. Distant supervision is widely applied approach to automatically
    generate large amounts of labelled data with low manual annotation cost. However,
    distant supervision inevitably accompanies the wrong labelling problem, which
    will negatively affect the performance of Relation Extraction (RE). To address
    this issue, (Han et al., 2018) proposes a novel framework for jointly training
    both RE model and Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) model to extract structured
    knowledge from non-scientific dataset. In this work, we firstly investigate the
    feasibility of this framework on scientific dataset, specifically on biomedical
    dataset. Secondly, to achieve better performance on the biomedical dataset, we
    extend the framework with other competitive KGC models. Moreover, we proposed
    a new end-to-end KGC model to extend the framework. Experimental results not only
    show the feasibility of the framework on the biomedical dataset, but also indicate
    the effectiveness of our extensions, because our extended model achieves significant
    and consistent improvements on distant supervised RE as compared with baselines.

  abstract: "As scientific communities grow and evolve, there is a high demand for\
    \ improved methods for finding relevant papers, comparing papers on similar topics\
    \ and studying trends in the research community. All these tasks involve the common\
    \ problem of extracting structured information from scientific articles. In this\
    \ paper, we propose a novel, scalable, semi-supervised method for extracting relevant\
    \ structured information from the vast available raw scientific literature. We\
    \ extract the fundamental concepts of \u201Caim\u201D, \u201Dmethod\u201D and\
    \ \u201Cresult\u201D from scientific articles and use them to construct a knowledge\
    \ graph. Our algorithm makes use of domain-based word embedding and the bootstrap\
    \ framework. Our experiments show that our system achieves precision and recall\
    \ comparable to the state of the art. We also show the domain independence of\
    \ our algorithm by analyzing the research trends of two distinct communities -\
    \ computational linguistics and computer vision."

  abstract: An important task in the machine reading of biochemical events expressed
    in biomedical texts is correctly reading the polarity, i.e., attributing whether
    the biochemical event is a promotion or an inhibition. Here we present a novel
    dataset for studying polarity attribution accuracy. We use this dataset to train
    and evaluate several deep learning models for polarity identification, and compare
    these to a linguistically-informed model. The best performing deep learning architecture
    achieves 0.968 average F1 performance in a five-fold cross-validation study, a
    considerable improvement over the linguistically informed model average F1 of
    0.862.

  abstract: "Datasets are integral artifacts of empirical scientific research. However,\
    \ due to natural language variation, their recognition can be difficult and even\
    \ when identified, can often be inconsistently referred across and within publications.\
    \ We report our approach to the Coleridge Initiative\u2019s Rich Context Competition,\
    \ which tasks participants with identifying dataset surface forms (dataset mention\
    \ extraction) and associating the extracted mention to its referred dataset (dataset\
    \ classification). In this work, we propose various neural baselines and evaluate\
    \ these model on one-plus and zero-shot classification scenarios. We further explore\
    \ various joint learning approaches - exploring the synergy between the tasks\
    \ - and report the issues with such techniques."

  abstract: This paper explores a task for extracting a technological expression and
    its pros/cons from computer science papers. We report ongoing efforts on an annotated
    corpus of pros/cons and an analysis of the nature of the automatic extraction
    task. Specifically, we show how to adapt the targeted sentiment analysis task
    for pros/cons extraction in computer science papers and conduct an annotation
    study. In order to identify the challenges of the automatic extraction task, we
    construct a strong baseline model and conduct an error analysis. The experiments
    show that pros/cons can be consistently annotated by several annotators, and that
    the task is challenging due to domain-specific knowledge. The annotated dataset
    is made publicly available for research purposes.

  abstract: Standard paradigms for search do not work well in the medical context.
    Typical information needs, such as retrieving a full list of medical interventions
    for a given condition, or finding the reported efficacy of a particular treatment
    with respect to a specific outcome of interest cannot be straightforwardly posed
    in typical text-box search. Instead, we propose faceted-search in which a user
    specifies a condition and then can browse treatments and outcomes that have been
    evaluated. Choosing from these, they can access randomized control trials (RCTs)
    describing individual studies. Realizing such a view of the medical evidence requires
    information extraction techniques to identify the population, interventions, and
    outcome measures in an RCT. Patients, health practitioners, and biomedical librarians
    all stand to benefit from such innovation in search of medical evidence. We present
    an initial prototype of such an interface applied to pre-registered clinical studies.
    We also discuss pilot studies into the applicability of information extraction
    methods to allow for similar access to all published trial results.

  abstract: 'Toponym detection in scientific papers is an open task and a key first
    step in place entity enrichment of documents. We examine three common neural architectures
    in NLP: 1) convolutional neural network, 2) multi-layer perceptron (both applied
    in a sliding window context) and 3) bidirectional LSTM and apply contextual and
    non-contextual word embedding layers to these models. We find that deep contextual
    word embeddings improve the performance of the bi-LSTM with CRF neural architecture
    achieving the best performance when multiple layers of deep contextual embeddings
    are concatenated. Our best performing model achieves an average F1 of 0.910 when
    evaluated on overlap macro exceeding previous state-of-the-art models in the toponym
    detection task.'

  abstract: Understanding procedural text requires tracking entities, actions and
    effects as the narrative unfolds. We focus on the challenging real-world problem
    of action-graph extraction from materials science papers, where language is highly
    specialized and data annotation is expensive and scarce. We propose a novel approach,
    Text2Quest, where procedural text is interpreted as instructions for an interactive
    game. A learning agent completes the game by executing the procedure correctly
    in a text-based simulated lab environment. The framework can complement existing
    approaches and enables richer forms of learning compared to static texts. We discuss
    potential limitations and advantages of the approach, and release a prototype
    proof-of-concept, hoping to encourage research in this direction.

  abstract: Mathematical expressions (ME) are widely used in scholar documents. In
    this paper we analyze characteristics of textual and visual MEs characteristics
    for the image-to-LaTeX translation task. While there are open data-sets of LaTeX
    files with MEs included it is very complicated to extract these MEs from a document
    and to compile the list of MEs. Therefore we release a corpus of open-access scholar
    documents with PDF and JATS-XML parallel files. The MEs in these documents are
    LaTeX encoded and are document independent. The data contains more than 1.2 million
    distinct annotated formulae and more than 80 million raw tokens of LaTeX MEs in
    more than 8 thousand documents. While the variety of textual lengths and visual
    sizes of MEs are not well defined we found that the task of analyzing MEs in scholar
    documents can be reduced to the subtask of a particular text length, image width
    and height bounds, and display MEs can be processed as arrays of partial MEs.

  abstract: In this exploratory study, we attempt to automatically induce PDTB-style
    relations from RST trees. We work with a German corpus of news commentary articles,
    annotated for RST trees and explicit PDTB-style relations and we focus on inducing
    the implicit relations in an automated way. Preliminary results look promising
    as a high-precision (but low-recall) way of finding implicit relations where there
    is no shallow structure annotated at all, but mapping proves more difficult in
    cases where EDUs and relation arguments overlap, yet do not seem to signal the
    same relation.

W19-2703:
  abstract: 'Implicit discourse relation classification is one of the most challenging
    and important tasks in discourse parsing, due to the lack of connectives as strong
    linguistic cues. A principle bottleneck to further improvement is the shortage
    of training data (ca. 18k instances in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)). Shi
    et al. (2017) proposed to acquire additional data by exploiting connectives in
    translation: human translators mark discourse relations which are implicit in
    the source language explicitly in the translation. Using back-translations of
    such explicitated connectives improves discourse relation parsing performance.
    This paper addresses the open question of whether the choice of the translation
    language matters, and whether multiple translations into different languages can
    be effectively used to improve the quality of the additional data.'

  abstract: The first step in discourse analysis involves dividing a text into segments.
    We annotate the first high-quality small-scale medical corpus in English with
    discourse segments and analyze how well news-trained segmenters perform on this
    domain. While we expectedly find a drop in performance, the nature of the segmentation
    errors suggests some problems can be addressed earlier in the pipeline, while
    others would require expanding the corpus to a trainable size to learn the nuances
    of the medical domain.

  abstract: We investigate the relationship between the notion of nuclearity as proposed
    in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and the signalling of coherence relations.
    RST relations are categorized as either mononuclear (comprising a nucleus and
    a satellite span) or multinuclear (comprising two or more nuclei spans). We examine
    how mononuclear relations (e.g., Antithesis, Condition) and multinuclear relations
    (e.g., Contrast, List) are indicated by relational signals, more particularly
    by discourse markers (e.g., because, however, if, therefore). We conduct a corpus
    study, examining the distribution of either type of relations in the RST Discourse
    Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002) and the distribution of discourse markers for
    those relations in the RST Signalling Corpus (Das et al., 2015). Our results show
    that discourse markers are used more often to signal multinuclear relations than
    mononuclear relations. The findings also suggest a complex relationship between
    the relation types and syntactic categories of discourse markers (subordinating
    and coordinating conjunctions).

  abstract: "The relational status of Attribution in Rhetorical Structure Theory has\
    \ been a matter of ongoing debate. Although several researchers have weighed in\
    \ on the topic, and although numerous studies have relied upon attributional structures\
    \ for their analyses, nothing approaching consensus has emerged. This paper identifies\
    \ three basic issues that must be resolved to determine the relational status\
    \ of attributions. These are identified as the Discourse Units Issue, the Nuclearity\
    \ Issue, and the Relation Identification Issue. These three issues are analyzed\
    \ from the perspective of classical RST. A finding of this analysis is that the\
    \ nuclearity and the relational identification of attribution structures are shown\
    \ to depend on the writer\u2019s intended effect, such that attributional relations\
    \ cannot be considered as a single relation, but rather as attributional instances\
    \ of other RST relations."

  abstract: We introduce our pilot study applying PDTB-style annotation to Twitter
    conversations. Lexically grounded coherence annotation for Twitter threads will
    enable detailed investigations of the discourse structure of conversations on
    social media. Here, we present our corpus of 185 threads and annotation, including
    an inter-annotator agreement study. We discuss our observations as to how Twitter
    discourses differ from written news text wrt. discourse connectives and relations.
    We confirm our hypothesis that discourse relations in written social media conversations
    are expressed differently than in (news) text. We find that in Twitter, connective
    arguments frequently are not full syntactic clauses, and that a few general connectives
    expressing EXPANSION and CONTINGENCY make up the majority of the explicit relations
    in our data.

  abstract: This paper presents a new system for open-ended discourse relation signal
    annotation in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), implemented
    on top of an online tool for RST annotation. We discuss existing projects annotating
    textual signals of discourse relations, which have so far not allowed simultaneously
    structuring and annotating words signaling hierarchical discourse trees, and demonstrate
    the design and applications of our interface by extending existing RST annotations
    in the freely available GUM corpus.

  abstract: Development of discourse parsers to annotate the relational discourse
    structure of a text is crucial for many downstream tasks. However, most of the
    existing work focuses on English, assuming a quite large dataset. Discourse data
    have been annotated for Basque, but training a system on these data is challenging
    since the corpus is very small. In this paper, we create the first demonstrator
    based on RST for Basque, and we investigate the use of data in another language
    to improve the performance of a Basque discourse parser. More precisely, we build
    a monolingual system using the small set of data available and investigate the
    use of multilingual word embeddings to train a system for Basque using data annotated
    for another language. We found that our approach to building a system limited
    to the small set of data available for Basque allowed us to get an improvement
    over previous approaches making use of many data annotated in other languages.
    At best, we get 34.78 in F1 for the full discourse structure. More data annotation
    is necessary in order to improve the results obtained with these techniques. We
    also describe which relations match with the gold standard, in order to understand
    these results.

  abstract: Recent research on discourse relations has found that they are cued not
    only by discourse markers (DMs) but also by other textual signals and that signaling
    information is indicative of genres. While several corpora exist with discourse
    relation signaling information such as the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, Prasad
    et al. 2008) and the Rhetorical Structure Theory Signalling Corpus (RST-SC, Das
    and Taboada 2018), they both annotate the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of
    the Penn Treebank (PTB, Marcus et al. 1993), which is limited to the news domain.
    Thus, this paper adapts the signal identification and anchoring scheme (Liu and
    Zeldes, 2019) to three more genres, examines the distribution of signaling devices
    across relations and genres, and provides a taxonomy of indicative signals found
    in this dataset.

  abstract: We describe a series of experiments applied to data sets from different
    languages and genres annotated for coherence relations according to different
    theoretical frameworks. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a unified
    (theory-neutral) approach toward discourse segmentation; a process which divides
    a text into minimal discourse units that are involved in s coherence relation.
    We apply a RandomForest and an LSTM based approach for all data sets, and we improve
    over a simple baseline assuming simple sentence or clause-like segmentation. Performance
    however varies a lot depending on language, and more importantly genre, with f-scores
    ranging from 73.00 to 94.47.

  abstract: Segmentation is the first step in building practical discourse parsers,
    and is often neglected in discourse parsing studies. The goal is to identify the
    minimal spans of text to be linked by discourse relations, or to isolate explicit
    marking of discourse relations. Existing systems on English report F1 scores as
    high as 95%, but they generally assume gold sentence boundaries and are restricted
    to English newswire texts annotated within the RST framework. This article presents
    a generic approach and a system, ToNy, a discourse segmenter developed for the
    DisRPT shared task where multiple discourse representation schemes, languages
    and domains are represented. In our experiments, we found that a straightforward
    sequence prediction architecture with pretrained contextual embeddings is sufficient
    to reach performance levels comparable to existing systems, when separately trained
    on each corpus. We report performance between 81% and 96% in F1 score. We also
    observed that discourse segmentation models only display a moderate generalization
    capability, even within the same language and discourse representation scheme.

  abstract: 'The DISPRT 2019 workshop has organized a shared task aiming to identify
    cross-formalism and multilingual discourse segments. Elementary Discourse Units
    (EDUs) are quite similar across different theories. Segmentation is the very first
    stage on the way of rhetorical annotation. Still, each annotation project adopted
    several decisions with consequences not only on the annotation of the relational
    discourse structure but also at the segmentation stage. In this shared task, we
    have employed pre-trained word embeddings, neural networks (BiLSTM+CRF) to perform
    the segmentation. We report F1 results for 6 languages: Basque (0.853), English
    (0.919), French (0.907), German (0.913), Portuguese (0.926) and Spanish (0.868
    and 0.769). Finally, we also pursued an error analysis based on clause typology
    for Basque and Spanish, in order to understand the performance of the segmenter.'

  abstract: Discourse information is crucial for a better understanding of the text
    structure and it is also necessary to describe which part of an opinionated text
    is more relevant or to decide how a text span can change the polarity (strengthen
    or weaken) of other span by means of coherence relations. This work presents the
    first results on the annotation of the Basque Opinion Corpus using Rhetorical
    Structure Theory (RST). Our evaluation results and analysis show us the main avenues
    to improve on a future annotation process. We have also extracted the subjectivity
    of several rhetorical relations and the results show the effect of sentiment words
    in relations and the influence of each relation in the semantic orientation value.

  abstract: This study aims to model the discourse structure of spontaneous spoken
    responses within the context of an assessment of English speaking proficiency
    for non-native speakers. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) has been commonly used
    in the analysis of discourse organization of written texts; however, limited research
    has been conducted to date on RST annotation and parsing of spoken language, in
    particular, non-native spontaneous speech. Due to the fact that the measurement
    of discourse coherence is typically a key metric in human scoring rubrics for
    assessments of spoken language, we conducted research to obtain RST annotations
    on non-native spoken responses from a standardized assessment of academic English
    proficiency. Subsequently, automatic parsers were trained on these annotations
    to process non-native spontaneous speech. Finally, a set of features were extracted
    from automatically generated RST trees to evaluate the discourse structure of
    non-native spontaneous speech, which were then employed to further improve the
    validity of an automated speech scoring system.

  abstract: "In many NLP applications like search and information extraction for named\
    \ entities, it is necessary to find all the mentions of a named entity, some of\
    \ which appear as pronouns (she, his, etc.) or nominals (the professor, the German\
    \ chancellor, etc.). It is therefore important that coreference resolution systems\
    \ are able to link these different types of mentions to the correct entity name.\
    \ We evaluate state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems for the task of\
    \ resolving all mentions to named entities. Our analysis reveals that standard\
    \ coreference metrics do not reflect adequately the requirements in this task:\
    \ they do not penalize systems for not identifying any mentions by name to an\
    \ entity and they reward systems even if systems find correctly mentions to the\
    \ same entity but fail to link these to a proper name (she\u2013the student\u2013\
    no name). We introduce new metrics for evaluating named entity coreference that\
    \ address these discrepancies and show that for the comparisons of competitive\
    \ systems, standard coreference evaluations could give misleading results for\
    \ this task. We are, however, able to confirm that the state-of-the art system\
    \ according to traditional evaluations also performs vastly better than other\
    \ systems on the named entity coreference task."

  abstract: We propose an end-to-end coreference resolution system obtained by adapting
    neural models that have recently improved the state-of-the-art on the OntoNotes
    benchmark to make them applicable to other paradigms for this task. We report
    the performances of our system on ANCOR, a corpus of transcribed oral French,
    for which it constitutes a new baseline with proper evaluation.

  abstract: "We explore different approaches to explicit entity modelling in language\
    \ models (LM). We independently replicate two existing models in a controlled\
    \ setup, introduce a simplified variant of one of the models and analyze their\
    \ performance in direct comparison. Our results suggest that today\u2019s models\
    \ are limited as several stochastic variables make learning difficult. We show\
    \ that the most challenging point in the systems is the decision if the next token\
    \ is an entity token. The low precision and recall for this variable will lead\
    \ to severe cascading errors. Our own simplified approach dispenses with the need\
    \ for latent variables and improves the performance in the entity yes/no decision.\
    \ A standard well-tuned baseline RNN-LM with a larger number of hidden units outperforms\
    \ all entity-enabled LMs in terms of perplexity."

  abstract: Clustering unlinkable entity mentions across documents in multiple languages
    (cross-lingual NIL Clustering) is an important task as part of Entity Discovery
    and Linking (EDL). This task has been largely neglected by the EDL community because
    it is challenging to outperform simple edit distance or other heuristics based
    baselines. We propose a novel approach based on encoding the orthographic similarity
    of the mentions using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Our model
    adapts a training procedure from the one-shot facial recognition literature in
    order to achieve this. We also perform several exploratory probing tasks on our
    name encodings in order to determine what specific types of information are likely
    to be encoded by our model. Experiments show our approach provides up to a 6.6%
    absolute CEAFm F-Score improvement over state-of-the-art methods and successfully
    captures phonological relations across languages.

  abstract: In the present paper, we deal with incongruences in English-German multilingual
    coreference annotation and present automated methods to discover them. More specifically,
    we automatically detect full coreference chains in parallel texts and analyse
    discrepancies in their annotations. In doing so, we wish to find out whether the
    discrepancies rather derive from language typological constraints, from the translation
    or the actual annotation process. The results of our study contribute to the referential
    analysis of similarities and differences across languages and support evaluation
    of cross-lingual coreference annotation. They are also useful for cross-lingual
    coreference resolution systems and contrastive linguistic studies.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a cross-lingual neural coreference resolution
    system for a less-resourced language such as Basque. To begin with, we build the
    first neural coreference resolution system for Basque, training it with the relatively
    small EPEC-KORREF corpus (45,000 words). Next, a cross-lingual coreference resolution
    system is designed. With this approach, the system learns from a bigger English
    corpus, using cross-lingual embeddings, to perform the coreference resolution
    for Basque. The cross-lingual system obtains slightly better results (40.93 F1
    CoNLL) than the monolingual system (39.12 F1 CoNLL), without using any Basque
    language corpus to train it.

  abstract: "Recent psycholinguistic evidence suggests that human parsing of moved\
    \ elements is \u2018active\u2019, and perhaps even \u2018hyper-active\u2019: it\
    \ seems that a leftward-moved object is related to a verbal position rapidly,\
    \ perhaps even before the transitivity information associated with the verb is\
    \ available to the listener. This paper presents a formal, sound and complete\
    \ parser for Minimalist Grammars whose search space contains branching points\
    \ that we can identify as the locus of the decision to perform this kind of active\
    \ gap-finding. This brings formal models of parsing into closer contact with recent\
    \ psycholinguistic theorizing than was previously possible."

  abstract: "The word \u201Cto\u201D that precedes verbs in English infinitives is\
    \ optional in at least two environments: in what Wasow et al. (2015) previously\
    \ called the \u201Cdo-be\u201D construction, and in the complement of \u201Chelp\u201D\
    , which we explore in the present work. In the \u201Cdo-be\u201D construction,\
    \ Wasow et al. found that a preceding infinitival \u201Cto\u201D increases the\
    \ use of following optional \u201Cto\u201D, but the use of \u201Cto\u201D in the\
    \ complement of help is reduced following \u201Cto help\u201D. We examine two\

  abstract: "Multilingual speakers are able to switch from one language to the other\
    \ (\u201Ccode-switch\u201D) between or within sentences. Because the underlying\
    \ cognitive mechanisms are not well understood, in this study we use computational\
    \ cognitive modeling to shed light on the process of code-switching. We employed\
    \ the Bilingual Dual-path model, a Recurrent Neural Network of bilingual sentence\
    \ production (Tsoukala et al., 2017), and simulated sentence production in simultaneous\
    \ Spanish-English bilinguals. Our first goal was to investigate whether the model\
    \ would code-switch without being exposed to code-switched training input. The\
    \ model indeed produced code-switches even without any exposure to such input\
    \ and the patterns of code-switches are in line with earlier linguistic work (Poplack,1980).\
    \ The second goal of this study was to investigate an auxiliary phrase asymmetry\
    \ that exists in Spanish-English code-switched production. Using this cognitive\
    \ model, we examined a possible cause for this asymmetry. To our knowledge, this\

  abstract: Based on the Production-Distribution-Comprehension (PDC) account of language
    processing, we formulate two distinct hypotheses about case marking, word order
    choices and processing in Hindi. Our first hypothesis is that Hindi tends to optimize
    for processing efficiency at both lexical and syntactic levels. We quantify the
    role of case markers in this process. For the task of predicting the reference
    sentence occurring in a corpus (amidst meaning-equivalent grammatical variants)
    using a machine learning model, surprisal estimates from an artificial version
    of the language (i.e., Hindi without any case markers) result in lower prediction
    accuracy compared to natural Hindi. Our second hypothesis is that Hindi tends
    to minimize interference due to case markers while ordering preverbal constituents.
    We show that Hindi tends to avoid placing next to each other constituents whose
    heads are marked by identical case inflections. Our findings adhere to PDC assumptions
    and we discuss their implications for language production, learning and universals.

  abstract: "Sentences are represented as hierarchical syntactic structures, which\
    \ have been successfully modeled in sentence processing. In contrast, despite\
    \ the theoretical agreement on hierarchical syntactic structures within words,\
    \ words have been argued to be computationally less complex than sentences and\
    \ implemented by finite-state models as linear strings of morphemes, and even\
    \ the psychological reality of morphemes has been denied. In this paper, extending\
    \ the computational models employed in sentence processing to morphological processing,\
    \ we performed a computational simulation experiment where, given incremental\
    \ surprisal as a linking hypothesis, five computational models with different\
    \ representational assumptions were evaluated against human reaction times in\
    \ visual lexical decision experiments available from the English Lexicon Project\
    \ (ELP), a \u201Cshared task\u201D in the morphological processing literature.\
    \ The simulation experiment demonstrated that (i) \u201Camorphous\u201D models\
    \ without morpheme units underperformed relative to \u201Cmorphous\u201D models,\
    \ (ii) a computational model with hierarchical syntactic structures, Probabilistic\
    \ Context-Free Grammar (PCFG), most accurately explained human reaction times,\
    \ and (iii) this performance was achieved on top of surface frequency effects.\
    \ These results strongly suggest that morphological processing tracks morphemes\
    \ incrementally from left to right and parses them into hierarchical syntactic\
    \ structures, contrary to \u201Camorphous\u201D and finite-state models of morphological\
    \ processing."

  abstract: Processing difficulty in online language comprehension has been explained
    in terms of surprisal and entropy reduction. Although both hypotheses have been
    supported by experimental data, we do not fully understand their relative contributions
    on processing difficulty. To develop a better understanding, we propose a mechanistic
    model of perceptual decision making that interacts with a simulated task environment
    with temporal dynamics. The proposed model collects noisy bottom-up evidence over
    multiple timesteps, integrates it with its top-down expectation, and makes perceptual
    decisions, producing processing time data directly without relying on any linking
    hypothesis. Temporal dynamics in the task environment was determined by a simple
    finite-state grammar, which was designed to create the situations where the surprisal
    and entropy reduction hypotheses predict different patterns. After the model was
    trained to maximize rewards, the model developed an adaptive policy and both surprisal
    and entropy effects were observed especially in a measure reflecting earlier processing.

  abstract: Cues to linguistic categories are distributed across the speech signal.
    Optimal categorization thus requires that listeners maintain gradient representations
    of incoming input in order to integrate that information with later cues. There
    is now evidence that listeners can and do integrate cues that occur far apart
    in time. Computational models of this integration have however been lacking. We
    take a first step at addressing this gap by mathematically formalizing four models
    of how listeners may maintain and use cue information during spoken language understanding
    and test them on two perception experiments. In one experiment, we find support
    for rational integration of cues at long distances. In a second, more memory and
    attention-taxing experiment, we find evidence in favor of a switching model that
    avoids maintaining detailed representations of cues in memory. These results are
    a first step in understanding what kinds of mechanisms listeners use for cue integration
    under different memory and attentional constraints.

    \ the \u201CEvolex\u201D project, gathering researchers in Psycholinguistics,\
    \ Neuropsychology, Computer Science, Natural Language Processing and Linguistics.\
    \ The Evolex project aims at proposing a new data-based inductive method for automatically\
    \ characterising the relation between pairs of french words collected in psycholinguistics\
    \ experiments on lexical access. This method takes advantage of several complementary\
    \ computational measures of semantic similarity. We show that some measures are\
    \ more correlated than others with the frequency of lexical associations, and\
    \ that they also differ in the way they capture different semantic relations.\
    \ This allows us to consider building a multidimensional lexical similarity to\
    \ automate the classification of lexical associations."

  abstract: Backward saccades during reading have been hypothesized to be involved
    in structural reanalysis, or to be related to the level of text difficulty. We
    test the hypothesis that backward saccades are involved in online syntactic analysis.
    If this is the case we expect that saccades will coincide, at least partially,
    with the edges of the relations computed by a dependency parser. In order to test
    this, we analyzed a large eye-tracking dataset collected while 102 participants
    read three short narrative texts. Our results show a relation between backward
    saccades and the syntactic structure of sentences.

  abstract: We propose a novel framework for modeling event-related potentials (ERPs)
    collected during reading that couples pre-trained convolutional decoders with
    a language model. Using this framework, we compare the abilities of a variety
    of existing and novel sentence processing models to reconstruct ERPs. We find
    that modern contextual word embeddings underperform surprisal-based models but
    that, combined, the two outperform either on its own.

  abstract: "Inspired by the literature on multisensory integration, we develop a\

    \ pick, out of nine quantifiers (\u2018few\u2019, \u2018many\u2019, \u2018all\u2019\
    , etc.), the one that is more likely to describe the percent of animals in a visual-auditory\
    \ input containing both animals and artifacts. We show that relying on concurrent\
    \ sensory inputs increases model performance on the quantification task. Moreover,\
    \ we evaluate the model in a situation in which only the auditory modality is\
    \ given, while the visual one is \u2018hallucinanted\u2019 either from the auditory\
    \ input itself or from a linguistic caption describing the quantity of entities\
    \ in the auditory input. This way, the model exploits prior associations between\

  abstract: A fundamental challenge when training counselors is presenting novices
    with the opportunity to practice counseling distressed individuals without exacerbating
    a situation. Rather than replacing human empathy with an automated counselor,
    we propose simulating an individual in crisis so that human counselors in training
    can practice crisis counseling in a low-risk environment. Towards this end, we
    collect a dataset of suicide prevention counselor role-play transcripts and make
    initial steps towards constructing a CRISISbot for humans to counsel while in
    training. In this data-constrained setting, we evaluate the potential for message
    retrieval to construct a coherent chat agent in light of recent advances with
    text embedding methods. Our results show that embeddings can considerably improve
    retrieval approaches to make them competitive with generative models. By coherently
    retrieving messages, we can help counselors practice chatting in a low-risk environment.

  abstract: "While conversation in therapy sessions can vary widely in both topic\
    \ and style, an understanding of the underlying techniques used by therapists\
    \ can provide valuable insights into how therapists best help clients of different\
    \ types. Dialogue act classification aims to identify the conversational \u201C\
    action\u201D each speaker takes at each utterance, such as sympathizing, problem-solving\
    \ or assumption checking. We propose to apply dialogue act classification to therapy\
    \ transcripts, using a therapy-specific labeling scheme, in order to gain a high-level\
    \ understanding of the flow of conversation in therapy sessions. We present a\
    \ novel annotation scheme that spans multiple psychotherapeutic approaches, apply\
    \ it to a large and diverse corpus of psychotherapy transcripts, and present and\
    \ discuss classification results obtained using both SVM and neural network-based\
    \ models. The results indicate that identifying the structure and flow of therapeutic\
    \ actions is an obtainable goal, opening up the opportunity in the future to provide\
    \ therapeutic recommendations tailored to specific client situations."

  abstract: This paper summarizes our participation to the CLPsych 2019 shared task,
    under the name CLaC. The goal of the shared task was to detect and assess suicide
    risk based on a collection of online posts. For our participation, we used an
    ensemble method which utilizes 8 neural sub-models to extract neural features
    and predict class probabilities, which are then used by an SVM classifier. Our
    team ranked first in 2 out of the 3 tasks (tasks A and C).

  abstract: "Mental health predictive systems typically model language as if from\
    \ a single context (e.g. Twitter posts, status updates, or forum posts) and often\
    \ limited to a single level of analysis (e.g. either the message-level or user-level).\
    \ Here, we bring these pieces together to explore the use of open-vocabulary (BERT\
    \ embeddings, topics) and theoretical features (emotional expression lexica, personality)\
    \ for the task of suicide risk assessment on support forums (the CLPsych-2019\
    \ Shared Task). We used dual context based approaches (modeling content from suicide\
    \ forums separate from other content), built over both traditional ML models as\
    \ well as a novel dual RNN architecture with user-factor adaptation. We find that\
    \ while affect from the suicide context distinguishes with no-risk from those\
    \ with \u201Cany-risk\u201D, personality factors from the non-suicide contexts\
    \ provide distinction of the levels of risk: low, medium, and high risk. Within\
    \ the shared task, our dual-context approach (listed as SBU-HLAB in the official\
    \ results) achieved state-of-the-art performance predicting suicide risk using\
    \ a combination of suicide-context and non-suicide posts (Task B), achieving an\
    \ F1 score of 0.50 over hidden test set labels."

  abstract: 'Spoken language ability is highly heterogeneous in Autism Spectrum Disorder
    (ASD), which complicates efforts to identify linguistic markers for use in diagnostic
    classification, clinical characterization, and for research and clinical outcome
    measurement. Machine learning techniques that harness the power of multivariate
    statistics and non-linear data analysis hold promise for modeling this heterogeneity,
    but many models require enormous datasets, which are unavailable for most psychiatric
    conditions (including ASD). In lieu of such datasets, good models can still be
    built by leveraging domain knowledge. In this study, we compare two machine learning
    approaches: the first approach incorporates prior knowledge about language variation
    across middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood to classify 6-minute naturalistic
    conversation samples from 140 age- and IQ-matched participants (81 with ASD),
    while the other approach treats all ages the same. We found that individual age-informed
    models were significantly more accurate than a single model tasked with building
    a common algorithm across age groups. Furthermore, predictive linguistic features
    differed significantly by age group, confirming the importance of considering
    age-related changes in language use when classifying ASD. Our results suggest
    that limitations imposed by heterogeneity inherent to ASD and from developmental
    change with age can be (at least partially) overcome using domain knowledge, such
    as understanding spoken language development from childhood through adulthood.'

  abstract: Increased access to large datasets has driven progress in NLP. However,
    most computational studies of clinically-validated, patient-generated speech and
    language involve very few datapoints, as such data are difficult (and expensive)
    to collect. In this position paper, we argue that we must find ways to promote
    data sharing across research groups, in order to build datasets of a more appropriate
    size for NLP and machine learning analysis. We review the benefits and challenges
    of sharing clinical language data, and suggest several concrete actions by both
    clinical and NLP researchers to encourage multi-site and multi-disciplinary data
    sharing. We also propose the creation of a collaborative data sharing platform,
    to allow NLP researchers to take a more active responsibility for data transcription,
    annotation, and curation.

  abstract: Depression is characterized by a self-focused negative attentional bias,
    which is often reflected in everyday language use. In a prospective writing study,
    we explored whether the association between depressive symptoms and negative,
    self-focused language varies across social contexts. College students (N = 243)
    wrote about a recent interaction with a person they care deeply about. Depression
    symptoms positively correlated with negative emotion words and first-person singular
    pronouns (or negative self-focus) when writing about a recent interaction with
    romantic partners or, to a lesser extent, friends, but not family members. The
    pattern of results was more pronounced when participants perceived greater self-other
    overlap (i.e., interpersonal closeness) with their romantic partner. Findings
    regarding how the linguistic profile of depression differs by type of relationship
    may inform more effective methods of clinical diagnosis and treatment.

  abstract: "We explore linguistic indicators of schizophrenia in Reddit discussion\
    \ forums. Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic mental disorder that affects a person\u2019\
    s thoughts and behaviors. Identifying and detecting signs of SZ is difficult given\
    \ that SZ is relatively uncommon, affecting approximately 1% of the US population,\
    \ and people suffering with SZ often believe that they do not have the disorder.\
    \ Linguistic abnormalities are a hallmark of SZ and many of the illness\u2019\
    s symptoms are manifested through language. In this paper we leverage the vast\
    \ amount of data available from social media and use statistical and machine learning\
    \ approaches to study linguistic characteristics of SZ. We collected and analyzed\
    \ a large corpus of Reddit posts from users claiming to have received a formal\
    \ diagnosis of SZ and identified several linguistic features that differentiated\
    \ these users from a control (CTL) group. We compared these results to other findings\
    \ on social media linguistic analysis and SZ. We also developed a machine learning\
    \ classifier to automatically identify self-identified users with SZ on Reddit."

  abstract: Natural language processing tools are used to automatically detect disturbances
    in transcribed speech of schizophrenia inpatients who speak Hebrew. We measure
    topic mutation over time and show that controls maintain more cohesive speech
    than inpatients. We also examine differences in how inpatients and controls use
    adjectives and adverbs to describe content words and show that the ones used by
    controls are more common than the those of inpatients. We provide experimental
    results and show their potential for automatically detecting schizophrenia in
    patients by means only of their speech patterns.

  abstract: "Computational linguistics holds promise for improving scientific integrity\
    \ in clinical psychology, and for reducing longstanding inequities in healthcare\
    \ access and quality. This paper describes how computational linguistics approaches\
    \ could address the \u201Creproducibility crisis\u201D facing social science,\
    \ particularly with regards to reliable diagnosis of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric\
    \ conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is argued that these\
    \ improvements in scientific integrity are poised to naturally reduce persistent\
    \ healthcare inequities in neglected subpopulations, such as verbally fluent girls\
    \ and women with ASD, but that concerted attention to this issue is necessary\
    \ to avoid reproducing biases built into training data. Finally, it is suggested\
    \ that computational linguistics is just one component of an emergent digital\
    \ phenotyping toolkit that could ultimately be used for clinical decision support,\
    \ to improve clinical care via precision medicine (i.e., personalized intervention\
    \ planning), granular treatment response monitoring (including remotely), and\
    \ for gene-brain-behavior studies aiming to pinpoint the underlying biological\
    \ etiology of otherwise behaviorally-defined conditions like ASD."

  abstract: "The Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) task is a classical neuropsychological\
    \ assessment where persons are asked to produce words belonging to a semantic\
    \ category (e.g., animals) in a given time. This paper introduces a novel method\
    \ of temporal analysis for SVF tasks utilizing time intervals and applies it to\
    \ a corpus of elderly Swedish subjects (mild cognitive impairment, subjective\
    \ cognitive impairment and healthy controls). A general decline in word count\
    \ and lexical frequency over the course of the task is revealed, as well as an\
    \ increase in word transition times. Persons with subjective cognitive impairment\
    \ had a higher word count during the last intervals, but produced words of the\
    \ same lexical frequencies. Persons with MCI had a steeper decline in both word\
    \ count and lexical frequencies during the third interval. Additional correlations\
    \ with neuropsychological scores suggest these findings are linked to a person\u2019\
    s overall vocabulary size and processing speed, respectively. Classification results\
    \ improved when adding the novel features (AUC=0.72), supporting their diagnostic\
    \ value."

  abstract: The ability to track mental health conditions via social media opened
    the doors for large-scale, automated, mental health surveillance. However, inferring
    accurate population-level trends requires representative samples of the underlying
    population, which can be challenging given the biases inherent in social media
    data. While previous work has adjusted samples based on demographic estimates,
    the populations were selected based on specific outcomes, e.g. specific mental
    health conditions. We depart from these methods, by conducting analyses over demographically
    representative digital cohorts of social media users. To validated this approach,
    we constructed a cohort of US based Twitter users to measure the prevalence of
    depression and PTSD, and investigate how these illnesses manifest across demographic
    subpopulations. The analysis demonstrates that cohort-based studies can help control
    for sampling biases, contextualize outcomes, and provide deeper insights into
    the data.

  abstract: Implicit motives allow for the characterization of behavior, subsequent
    success and long-term development. While this has been operationalized in the
    operant motive test, research on motives has declined mainly due to labor-intensive
    and costly human annotation. In this study, we analyze over 200,000 labeled data
    items from 40,000 participants and utilize them for engineering features for training
    a logistic model tree machine learning model. It captures manually assigned motives
    well with an F-score of 80%, coming close to the pairwise annotator intraclass
    correlation coefficient of r = .85. In addition, we found a significant correlation
    of r = .2 between subsequent academic success and data automatically labeled with
    our model in an extrinsic evaluation.

  abstract: Incoherent discourse in schizophrenia has long been recognized as a dominant
    symptom of the mental disorder (Bleuler, 1911/1950). Recent studies have used
    modern sentence and word embeddings to compute coherence metrics for spontaneous
    speech in schizophrenia. While clinical ratings always have a subjective element,
    computational linguistic methodology allows quantification of speech abnormalities.
    Clinical and empirical knowledge from psychiatry provide the theoretical and conceptual
    basis for modelling. Our study is an interdisciplinary attempt at improving coherence
    models in schizophrenia. Speech samples were obtained from healthy controls and
    patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and different
    severity of positive formal thought disorder. Interviews were transcribed and
    coherence metrics derived from different embeddings. One model found higher coherence
    metrics for controls than patients. All other models remained non-significant.
    More detailed analysis of the data motivates different approaches to improving
    coherence models in schizophrenia, e.g. by assessing referential abnormalities.

  abstract: "Verbal memory is affected by numerous clinical conditions and most neuropsychological\
    \ and clinical examinations evaluate it. However, a bottleneck exists in such\
    \ endeavors because traditional methods require expert human review, and usually\
    \ only a couple of test versions exist, thus limiting the frequency of administration\
    \ and clinical applications. The present study overcomes this bottleneck by automating\
    \ the administration, transcription, analysis and scoring of story recall. A large\
    \ group of healthy participants (n = 120) and patients with mental illness (n\
    \ = 105) interacted with a mobile application that administered a wide range of\
    \ assessments, including verbal memory. The resulting speech generated by participants\
    \ when retelling stories from the memory task was transcribed using automatic\
    \ speech recognition tools, which was compared with human transcriptions (overall\
    \ word error rate = 21%). An assortment of surface-level and semantic language-based\
    \ features were extracted from the verbal recalls. A final set of three features\
    \ were used to both predict expert human ratings with a ridge regression model\
    \ (r = 0.88) and to differentiate patients from healthy individuals with an ensemble\
    \ of logistic regression classifiers (accuracy = 76%). This is the first \u2018\
    outside of the laboratory\u2019 study to showcase the viability of the complete\
    \ pipeline of automated assessment of verbal memory in naturalistic settings."

  abstract: In this paper we describe the UniOvi-WESO classification systems proposed
    for the 2019 Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) Shared
    Task. We explore the use of two systems trained with ReachOut data from the 2016
    CLPsych task, and compare them to a baseline system trained with the data provided
    for this task. All the classifiers were trained with features extracted just from
    the text of each post, without using any other metadata. We found out that the
    baseline system performs slightly better than the pretrained systems, mainly due
    to the differences in labeling between the two tasks. However, they still work
    reasonably well and can detect if a user is at risk of suicide or not.

    \ of features: posting behaviour, sentiment, motivation, and content of the user\u2019\
    s posting. We use these features as an input in a support vector machine (SVM).\
    \ For the language model approach, we trained a language model for each risk level\
    \ using all the posts from the users as the training corpora. Then, we computed\
    \ the perplexity of each user\u2019s posts to determine how likely his/her posts\
    \ were to belong to each risk level. Finally, we built a hybrid model that combines\
    \ both the language model and the behavioral model, which demonstrates the best\
    \ performance in detecting the suicide risk level."

  abstract: "This paper describes IDLab\u2019s text classification systems submitted\
    \ to Task A as part of the CLPsych 2019 shared task. The aim of this shared task\
    \ was to develop automated systems that predict the degree of suicide risk of\
    \ people based on their posts on Reddit. Bag-of-words features, emotion features\
    \ and post level predictions are used to derive user-level predictions. Linear\
    \ models and ensembles of these models are used to predict final scores. We find\
    \ that predicting fine-grained risk levels is much more difficult than flagging\
    \ potentially at-risk users. Furthermore, we do not find clear added value from\
    \ building richer ensembles compared to simple baselines, given the available\
    \ training data and the nature of the prediction task."

  abstract: "We aimed to predict an individual suicide risk level from longitudinal\
    \ posts on Reddit discussion forums. Through participating in a shared task competition\
    \ hosted by CLPsych2019, we received two annotated datasets: a training dataset\
    \ with 496 users (31,553 posts) and a test dataset with 125 users (9610 posts).\
    \ We submitted results from our three best-performing machine-learning models:\
    \ SVM, Na\xEFve Bayes, and an ensemble model. Each model provided a user\u2019\
    s suicide risk level in four categories, i.e., no risk, low risk, moderate risk,\
    \ and severe risk. Among the three models, the ensemble model had the best macro-averaged\
    \ F1 score 0.379 when tested on the holdout test dataset. The NB model had the\
    \ best performance in two additional binary-classification tasks, i.e., no risk\
    \ vs. flagged risk (any risk level other than no risk) with F1 score 0.836 and\
    \ no or low risk vs. urgent risk (moderate or severe risk) with F1 score 0.736.\
    \ We conclude that the NB model may serve as a tool for identifying users with\
    \ flagged or urgent suicide risk based on longitudinal posts on Reddit discussion\
    \ forums."

    \ (CLPsych2019). The goal is to assess the degree of suicide risk of social media\
    \ users given a labelled dataset with their posts. An appropriate suicide risk\
    \ assessment, with the usage of automated methods, can assist experts on the detection\
    \ of people at risk and eventually contribute to prevent suicide. We propose a\
    \ set of machine learning models with features based on lexicons, word embeddings,\
    \ word level n-grams, and statistics extracted from users\u2019 posts. The results\
    \ show that the most effective models for the tasks are obtained integrating lexicon-based\
    \ features, a selected set of n-grams, and statistical measures."

    \ This research, motivated by the CLPsych 2019 shared task, developed neural network-based\
    \ methods for analyzing posts in one or more Reddit forums to assess the subject\u2019\
    s suicide risk. One of the technical challenges this task poses is the large amount\
    \ of text from multiple posts of a single user. Our neural network models use\
    \ the advanced multi-headed Attention-based autoencoder architecture, called Bidirectional\
    \ Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Our system achieved the 2nd\
    \ best performance of 0.477 macro averaged F measure on Task A of the challenge.\
    \ Among the three different alternatives we developed for the challenge, the single\
    \ BERT model that processed all of a user\u2019s posts performed the best on all\
    \ three Tasks."

  abstract: In this summary, we discuss our approach to the CLPsych Shared Task and
    its initial results. For our predictions in each task, we used a recursive partitioning
    algorithm (decision trees) to select from our set of features, which were primarily
    dictionary scores and counts of individual words. We focused primarily on Task
    A, which aimed to predict suicide risk, as rated by a team of expert clinicians
    (Shing et al., 2018), based on language used in SuicideWatch posts on Reddit.
    Category-level findings highlight the potential importance of social and moral
    language categories. Word-level correlates of risk levels underline the value
    of fine-grained data-driven approaches, revealing both theory-consistent and potentially
    novel correlates of suicide risk that may motivate future research.

  abstract: In finite-state language processing pipelines, a lexicon is often a key
    component. It needs to be comprehensive to ensure accuracy, reducing out-of-vocabulary
    misses. However, in memory-constrained environments (e.g., mobile phones), the
    size of the component automata must be kept small. Indeed, a delicate balance
    between comprehensiveness, speed, and memory must be struck to conform to device
    requirements while providing a good user experience.In this paper, we describe
    a compression scheme for lexicons when represented as finite-state transducers.
    We efficiently encode the graph of the transducer while storing transition labels
    separately. The graph encoding scheme is based on the LOUDS (Level Order Unary
    Degree Sequence) tree representation, which has constant time tree traversal for
    queries while being information-theoretically optimal in space. We find that our
    encoding is near the theoretical lower bound for such graphs and substantially
    outperforms more traditional representations in space while remaining competitive
    in latency benchmarks.

  abstract: Tests added to Kleene algebra (by Kozen and others) are considered within
    Monadic Second Order logic over strings, where they are likened to statives in
    natural language. Reducts are formed over tests and non-tests alike, specifying
    what is observable. Notions of temporal granularity are based on observable change,
    under the assumption that a finite set bounds what is observable (with the possibility
    of stretching such bounds by moving to a larger finite set). String projections
    at different granularities are conjoined by superpositions that provide another
    variant of concatenation for Booleans.

  abstract: The research on machine learning of morphology often involves formulating
    morphological descriptions directly on surface forms of words. As the established
    two-level morphology paradigm requires the knowledge of the underlying structure,
    it is not widely used in such settings. In this paper, we propose a formalism
    describing structural relationships between words based on theories of morphology
    that reject the notions of internal word structure and morpheme. The formalism
    covers a wide variety of morphological phenomena (including non-concatenative
    ones like stem vowel alternation) without the need of workarounds and extensions.
    Furthermore, we show that morphological rules formulated in such way can be easily
    translated to FSTs, which enables us to derive performant approaches to morphological
    analysis, generation and automatic rule discovery.

  abstract: We develop a general framework for weighted parsing which is built on
    top of grammar-based language models and employs flexible weight algebras. It
    generalizes previous work in that area (semiring parsing, weighted deductive parsing)
    and also covers applications outside the classical scope of parsing, e.g., algebraic
    dynamic programming. We show an algorithm which terminates and is correct for
    a large class of weighted grammar-based language models.

  abstract: We present a broad coverage model of Turkish morphology and an open-source
    morphological analyzer that implements it. The model captures intricacies of Turkish
    morphology-syntax interface, thus could be used as a baseline that guides language
    model development. It introduces a novel fine part-of-speech tagset, a fine-grained
    affix inventory and represents morphotactics without zero-derivations. The morphological
    analyzer is freely available. It consists of modular reusable components of human-annotated
    gold standard lexicons, implements Turkish morphotactics as finite-state transducers
    using OpenFst and morphophonemic processes as Thrax grammars.

  abstract: This paper describes a new and larger coverage Finite-State Morphological
    Analyser (FSM) and Generator for the Dravidian language Tamil. The FSM has been
    developed in the context of computational grammar engineering, adhering to the
    standards of the ParGram effort. Tamil is a morphologically rich language and
    the interaction between linguistic analysis and formal implementation is complex,
    resulting in a challenging task. In order to allow the development of the FSM
    to focus more on the linguistic analysis and less on the formal details, we have
    developed a system of meta-morph(ology) rules along with a script which translates
    these rules into FSM processable representations. The introduction of meta-morph
    rules makes it possible for computationally naive linguists to interact with the
    system and to expand it in future work. We found that the meta-morph rules help
    to express linguistic generalisations and reduce the manual effort of writing
    lexical classes for morphological analysis. Our Tamil FSM currently handles mainly
    the inflectional morphology of 3,300 verb roots and their 260 forms. Further,
    it also has a lexicon of approximately 100,000 nouns along with a guesser to handle
    out-of-vocabulary items. Although the Tamil FSM was primarily developed to be
    part of a computational grammar, it can also be used as a web or stand-alone application
    for other NLP tasks, as per general ParGram practice.

  abstract: Weighted finite automata (WFA) are often used to represent probabilistic
    models, such as n-gram language models, since they are efficient for recognition
    tasks in time and space. The probabilistic source to be represented as a WFA,
    however, may come in many forms. Given a generic probabilistic model over sequences,
    we propose an algorithm to approximate it as a weighted finite automaton such
    that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the source model and the WFA target
    model is minimized. The proposed algorithm involves a counting step and a difference
    of convex optimization, both of which can be performed efficiently. We demonstrate
    the usefulness of our approach on some tasks including distilling n-gram models
    from neural models.

  abstract: Modeling sequence data using probabilistic finite state machines (PFSMs)
    is a technique that analyzes the underlying dynamics in sequences of symbols.
    Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) and hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs)
    are PFSMs that have been successfully applied to a wide variety of applications
    by extending HMMs to make the extracted patterns easier to interpret. However,
    these models are independently developed with their own training algorithm, so
    that we cannot combine multiple kinds of structures to build a PFSM for a specific
    application. In this paper, we prove that silent hidden Markov models (silent
    HMMs) are flexible models that have more expressive power than HSMMs and HHMMs.
    Silent HMMs are HMMs that contain silent states, which do not emit any observations.
    We show that we can obtain silent HMM equivalent to given HSMMs and HHMMs. We
    believe that these results form a firm foundation to use silent HMMs as a unified
    representation for PFSM modeling.

  abstract: The use of the Latin script for text entry of South Asian languages is
    common, even though there is no standard orthography for these languages in the
    script. We explore several compact finite-state architectures that permit variable
    spellings of words during mobile text entry. We find that approaches making use
    of transliteration transducers provide large accuracy improvements over baselines,
    but that simpler approaches involving a compact representation of many attested
    alternatives yields much of the accuracy gain. This is particularly important
    when operating under constraints on model size (e.g., on inexpensive mobile devices
    with limited storage and memory for keyboard models), and on speed of inference,
    since people typing on mobile keyboards expect no perceptual delay in keyboard
    responsiveness.

  abstract: Transition-based parsing of natural language uses transition systems to
    build directed annotation graphs (digraphs) for sentences. In this paper, we define,
    for an arbitrary ordered digraph, a unique decomposition and a corresponding linear
    encoding that are associated bijectively with each other via a new transition
    system. These results give us an efficient and succinct representation for digraphs
    and sets of digraphs. Based on the system and our analysis of its syntactic properties,
    we give structural bounds under which the set of encoded digraphs is restricted
    and becomes a context-free or a regular string language. The context-free restriction
    is essentially a superset of the encodings used previously to characterize properties
    of noncrossing digraphs and to solve maximal subgraphs problems. The regular restriction
    with a tight bound is shown to capture the Universal Dependencies v2.4 treebanks
    in linguistics.

  abstract: Claims database and electronic health records database do not usually
    capture kinship or family relationship information, which is imperative for genetic
    research. We identify online obituaries as a new data source and propose a special
    named entity recognition and relation extraction solution to extract names and
    kinships from online obituaries. Built on 1,809 annotated obituaries and a novel
    tagging scheme, our joint neural model achieved macro-averaged precision, recall
    and F measure of 72.69%, 78.54% and 74.93%, and micro-averaged precision, recall
    and F measure of 95.74%, 98.25% and 96.98% using 57 kinships with 10 or more examples
    in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment. The model performance improved dramatically
    when trained with 34 kinships with 50 or more examples. Leveraging additional
    information such as age, death date, birth date and residence mentioned by obituaries,
    we foresee a promising future of supplementing EHR databases with comprehensive
    and accurate kinship information for genetic research.

  abstract: In the medical domain, user-generated social media text is increasingly
    used as a valuable complementary knowledge source to scientific medical literature.
    The extraction of this knowledge is complicated by colloquial language use and
    misspellings. Yet, lexical normalization of such data has not been addressed properly.
    This paper presents an unsupervised, data-driven spelling correction module for
    medical social media. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art spelling correction
    and can detect mistakes with an F0.5 of 0.888. Additionally, we present a novel
    corpus for spelling mistake detection and correction on a medical patient forum.

  abstract: "The number of users of social media continues to grow, with nearly half\
    \ of adults worldwide and two-thirds of all American adults using social networking.\
    \ Advances in automated data processing, machine learning and NLP present the\
    \ possibility of utilizing this massive data source for biomedical and public\
    \ health applications, if researchers address the methodological challenges unique\
    \ to this media. We present the Social Media Mining for Health Shared Tasks collocated\
    \ with the ACL at Florence in 2019, which address these challenges for health\
    \ monitoring and surveillance, utilizing state of the art techniques for processing\
    \ noisy, real-world, and substantially creative language expressions from social\
    \ media users. For the fourth execution of this challenge, we proposed four different\
    \ tasks. Task 1 asked participants to distinguish tweets reporting an adverse\
    \ drug reaction (ADR) from those that do not. Task 2, a follow-up to Task 1, asked\
    \ participants to identify the span of text in tweets reporting ADRs. Task 3 is\
    \ an end-to-end task where the goal was to first detect tweets mentioning an ADR\
    \ and then map the extracted colloquial mentions of ADRs in the tweets to their\
    \ corresponding standard concept IDs in the MedDRA vocabulary. Finally, Task 4\
    \ asked participants to classify whether a tweet contains a personal mention of\
    \ one\u2019s health, a more general discussion of the health issue, or is an unrelated\
    \ mention. A total of 34 teams from around the world registered and 19 teams from\
    \ 12 countries submitted a system run. We summarize here the corpora for this\
    \ challenge which are freely available at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22521,\
    \ and present an overview of the methods and the results of the competing systems."

  abstract: The medical concept normalisation task aims to map textual descriptions
    to standard terminologies such as SNOMED-CT or MedDRA. Existing publicly available
    datasets annotated using different terminologies cannot be simply merged and utilised,
    and therefore become less valuable when developing machine learning-based concept
    normalisation systems. To address that, we designed a data harmonisation pipeline
    and engineered a corpus of 27,979 textual descriptions simultaneously mapped to
    both MedDRA and SNOMED-CT, sourced from five publicly available datasets across
    biomedical and social media domains. The pipeline can be used in the future to
    integrate new datasets into the corpus and also could be applied in relevant data
    curation tasks. We also described a method to merge different terminologies into
    a single concept graph preserving their relations and demonstrated that representation
    learning approach based on random walks on a graph can efficiently encode both
    hierarchical and equivalent relations and capture semantic similarities not only
    between concepts inside a given terminology but also between concepts from different
    terminologies. We believe that making a corpus and embeddings for cross-terminology
    medical concept normalisation available to the research community would contribute
    to a better understanding of the task.

  abstract: Depression and anxiety are the two most prevalent mental health disorders
    worldwide, impacting the lives of millions of people each year. In this work,
    we develop and evaluate a multilabel, multidimensional deep neural network designed
    to predict PHQ-4 scores based on individuals written text. Our system outperforms
    random baseline metrics and provides a novel approach to how we can predict psychometric
    scores from written text. Additionally, we explore how this architecture can be
    applied to analyse social media data.

    (HITSZ) team for the first and second subtasks of the fourth Social Media Mining
    for Health Applications (SMM4H) shared task in 2019. The two subtasks are automatic
    classification and extraction of adverse effect mentions in tweets. The systems
    for the two subtasks are based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
    (BERT), and achieves promising results. Among the systems we developed for subtask1,
    the best F1-score was 0.6457, for subtask2, the best relaxed F1-score and the
    best strict F1-score were 0.614 and 0.407 respectively. Our system ranks first
    among all systems on subtask1.

  abstract: 'This paper describes a system developed for the Social Media Mining for
    Health (SMM4H) 2019 shared tasks. Specifically, we participated in three tasks.
    The goals of the first two tasks are to classify whether a tweet contains mentions
    of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and extract these mentions, respectively. The
    objective of the third task is to build an end-to-end solution: first, detect
    ADR mentions and then map these entities to concepts in a controlled vocabulary.
    We investigate the use of a language representation model BERT trained to obtain
    semantic representations of social media texts. Our experiments on a dataset of
    user reviews showed that BERT is superior to state-of-the-art models based on
    recurrent neural networks. The BERT-based system for Task 1 obtained an F1 of
    57.38%, with improvements up to +7.19% F1 over a score averaged across all 43
    submissions. The ensemble of neural networks with a voting scheme for named entity
    recognition ranked first among 9 teams at the SMM4H 2019 Task 2 and obtained a
    relaxed F1 of 65.8%. The end-to-end model based on BERT for ADR normalization
    ranked first at the SMM4H 2019 Task 3 and obtained a relaxed F1 of 43.2%.'

  abstract: Identifying mentions of medical concepts in social media is challenging
    because of high variability in free text. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
    network architecture, the Collocated LSTM with Attentive Pooling and Aggregated
    representation (CLAPA), that integrates a bidirectional LSTM model with attention
    and pooling strategy and utilizes the collocation information from training data
    to improve the representation of medical concepts. The collocation and aggregation
    layers improve the model performance on the task of identifying mentions of adverse
    drug events (ADE) in tweets. Using the dataset made available as part of the workshop
    shared task, we show that careful selection of neighborhood contexts can help
    uncover useful local information and improve the overall medical concept representation.

  abstract: We study how language on social media is linked to mortal diseases such
    as atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD), diabetes and various types of cancer.
    Our proposed model leverages state-of-the-art sentence embeddings, followed by
    a regression model and clustering, without the need of additional labelled data.
    It allows to predict community-level medical outcomes from language, and thereby
    potentially translate these to the individual level. The method is applicable
    to a wide range of target variables and allows us to discover known and potentially
    novel correlations of medical outcomes with life-style aspects and other socioeconomic
    risk factors.

  abstract: "The increase in the prevalence of mental health problems has coincided\
    \ with a growing popularity of health related social networking sites. Regardless\
    \ of their therapeutic potential, on-line support groups (OSGs) can also have\
    \ negative effects on patients. In this work we propose a novel methodology to\
    \ automatically verify the presence of therapeutic factors in social networking\
    \ websites by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The methodology\
    \ is evaluated on on-line asynchronous multi-party conversations collected from\
    \ an OSG and Twitter. The results of the analysis indicate that therapeutic factors\
    \ occur more frequently in OSG conversations than in Twitter conversations. Moreover,\
    \ the analysis of OSG conversations reveals that the users of that platform are\
    \ supportive, and interactions are likely to lead to the improvement of their\
    \ emotional state. We believe that our method provides a stepping stone towards\
    \ automatic analysis of emotional states of users of online platforms. Possible\
    \ applications of the method include provision of guidelines that highlight potential\
    \ implications of using such platforms on users\u2019 mental health, and/or support\
    \ in the analysis of their impact on specific individuals."

  abstract: Transfer learning is promising for many NLP applications, especially in
    tasks with limited labeled data. This paper describes the methods developed by
    team TMRLeiden for the 2019 Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H)
    Shared Task. Our methods use state-of-the-art transfer learning methods to classify,
    extract and normalise adverse drug effects (ADRs) and to classify personal health
    mentions from health-related tweets. The code and fine-tuned models are publicly
    available.

    of the fourth Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) workshop. We
    enhance tweet representation with a language model and distinguish the importance
    of different words with Multi-Head Self-Attention. In addition, transfer learning
    is exploited to make up for the data shortage. Our system achieved competitive
    results on both tasks with an F1-score of 0.5718 for task 1 and 0.653 (overlap)
    / 0.357 (strict) for task 2.

  abstract: Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) Adverse Effect Mentions
    Shared Task challenges participants to accurately identify spans of text within
    a tweet that correspond to Adverse Effects (AEs) resulting from medication usage
    (Weissenbacher et al., 2019). This task features a training data set of 2,367
    tweets, in addition to a 1,000 tweet evaluation data set. The solution presented
    here features a bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Network (bi-LSTM) for the
    generation of character-level embeddings. It uses a second bi-LSTM trained on
    both character and token level embeddings to feed a Conditional Random Field (CRF)
    which provides the final classification. This paper further discusses the deep
    learning algorithms used in our solution.

  abstract: Over time the use of social networks is becoming very popular platforms
    for sharing health related information. Social Media Mining for Health Applications
    (SMM4H) provides tasks such as those described in this document to help manage
    information in the health domain. This document shows the first participation
    of the SINAI group. We study approaches based on machine learning and deep learning
    to extract adverse drug reaction mentions from Twitter. The results obtained in
    the tasks are encouraging, we are close to the average of all participants and
    even above in some cases.

  abstract: In this study, we describe our methods to automatically classify Twitter
    posts conveying events of adverse drug reaction (ADR). Based on our previous experience
    in tackling the ADR classification task, we empirically applied the vote-based
    under-sampling ensemble approach along with linear support vector machine (SVM)
    to develop our classifiers as part of our participation in ACL 2019 Social Media
    Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) shared task 1. The best-performed model
    on the test sets were trained on a merged corpus consisting of the datasets released
    by SMM4H 2017 and 2019. By using VUE, the corpus was randomly under-sampled with
    2:1 ratio between the negative and positive classes to create an ensemble using
    the linear kernel trained with features including bag-of-word, domain knowledge,
    negation and word embedding. The best performing model achieved an F-measure of
    0.551 which is about 5% higher than the average F-scores of 16 teams.

  abstract: This paper describes the models used by our team in SMM4H 2019 shared
    task. We submitted results for subtasks 1 and 2. For task 1 which aims to detect
    tweets with Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) mentions we used ELMo embeddings which
    is a deep contextualized word representation able to capture both syntactic and
    semantic characteristics. For task 2, which focuses on extraction of ADR mentions,
    first the same architecture as task 1 was used to identify whether or not a tweet
    contains ADR. Then, for tweets positively classified as mentioning ADR, the relevant
    text span was identified by similarity matching with 3 different lexicon sets.

  abstract: CLaC labs participated in Task 1 and 4 of SMM4H 2019. We pursed two main
    objectives in our submission. First we tried to use some textual features in a
    deep net framework, and second, the potential use of more than one word embedding
    was tested. The results seem positively affected by the proposed architectures.

  abstract: In this paper, we present our approach and the system description for
    the Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) Shared Task 1,2 and 4
    (2019). Our main contribution is to show the effectiveness of Transfer Learning
    approaches like BERT and ULMFiT, and how they generalize for the classification
    tasks like identification of adverse drug reaction mentions and reporting of personal
    health problems in tweets. We show the use of stacked embeddings combined with
    BLSTM+CRF tagger for identifying spans mentioning adverse drug reactions in tweets.
    We also show that these approaches perform well even with imbalanced dataset in
    comparison to undersampling and oversampling.

  abstract: Analyzing social media posts can offer insights into a wide range of topics
    that are commonly discussed online, providing valuable information for studying
    various health-related phenomena reported online. The outcome of this work can
    offer insights into pharmacovigilance research to monitor the adverse effects
    of medications. This research specifically looks into mentions of adverse drug
    reactions (ADRs) in Twitter data through the Social Media Mining for Health Applications
    (SMM4H) Shared Task 2019. Adverse drug reactions are undesired harmful effects
    which can arise from medication or other methods of treatment. The goal of this
    research is to build accurate models using natural language processing techniques
    to detect reports of adverse drug reactions in Twitter data and extract these
    words or phrases.

  abstract: Developers of cross-linguistic semantic annotation schemes face a number
    of issues not encountered in monolingual annotation. This paper discusses four
    such issues, related to the establishment of annotation labels, and the treatment
    of languages with more fine-grained, more coarse-grained, and cross-cutting categories.
    We propose that a lattice-like architecture of the annotation categories can adequately
    handle all four issues, and at the same time remain both intuitive for annotators
    and faithful to typological insights. This position is supported by a brief annotation
    experiment.

  abstract: "Meaning banking\u2014creating a semantically annotated corpus for the\
    \ purpose of semantic parsing or generation\u2014is a challenging task. It is\
    \ quite simple to come up with a complex meaning representation, but it is hard\
    \ to design a simple meaning representation that captures many nuances of meaning.\
    \ This paper lists some lessons learned in nearly ten years of meaning annotation\
    \ during the development of the Groningen Meaning Bank (Bos et al., 2017) and\
    \ the Parallel Meaning Bank (Abzianidze et al., 2017). The paper\u2019s format\
    \ is rather unconventional: there is no explicit related work, no methodology\
    \ section, no results, and no discussion (and the current snippet is not an abstract\
    \ but actually an introductory preface). Instead, its structure is inspired by\
    \ work of Traum (2000) and Bender (2013). The list starts with a brief overview\
    \ of the existing meaning banks (Section 1) and the rest of the items are roughly\
    \ divided into three groups: corpus collection (Section 2 and 3, annotation methods\
    \ (Section 4\u201311), and design of meaning representations (Section 12\u2013\
    30). We hope this overview will give inspiration and guidance in creating improved\
    \ meaning banks in the future"

  abstract: "In this paper, we propose an extension to Abstract Meaning Representations\
    \ (AMRs) to encode scope information of quantifiers and negation, in a way that\
    \ overcomes the semantic gaps of the schema while maintaining its cognitive simplicity.\
    \ Specifically, we address three phenomena not previously part of the AMR specification:\
    \ quantification, negation (generally), and modality. The resulting representation,\
    \ which we call \u201CUniform Meaning Representation\u201D (UMR), adopts the predicative\
    \ core of AMR and embeds it under a \u201Cscope\u201D graph when appropriate.\
    \ UMR representations differ from other treatments of quantification and modal\
    \ scope phenomena in two ways: (a) they are more transparent; and (b) they specify\
    \ default scope when possible.\u2018"

  abstract: The parsing accuracy varies a great deal for different meaning representations.
    In this paper, we compare the parsing performances between Abstract Meaning Representation
    (AMR) and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS), and provide an in-depth analysis
    of what factors contributed to the discrepancy in their parsing accuracy. By crystalizing
    the trade-off between representation expressiveness and ease of automatic parsing,
    we hope our results can help inform the design of the next-generation meaning
    representations.

  abstract: 'Three broad approaches have been attempted to combine distributional
    and structural/symbolic aspects to construct meaning representations: a) injecting
    linguistic features into distributional representations, b) injecting distributional
    features into symbolic representations or c) combining structural and distributional
    features in the final representation. This work focuses on an example of the third
    and less studied approach: it extends the Graphical Knowledge Representation (GKR)
    to include distributional features and proposes a division of semantic labour
    between the distributional and structural/symbolic features. We propose two extensions
    of GKR that clearly show this division and empirically test one of the proposals
    on an NLI dataset with hard compositional pairs.'

  abstract: Abstract Unscoped episodic logical form (ULF) is a semantic representation
    capturing the predicate-argument structure of English within the episodic logic
    formalism in relation to the syntactic structure, while leaving scope, word sense,
    and anaphora unresolved. We describe how ULF can be used to generate natural language
    inferences that are grounded in the semantic and syntactic structure through a
    small set of rules defined over interpretable predicates and transformations on
    ULFs. The semantic restrictions placed by ULF semantic types enables us to ensure
    that the inferred structures are semantically coherent while the nearness to syntax
    enables accurate mapping to English. We demonstrate these inferences on four classes
    of conversationally-oriented inferences in a mixed genre dataset with 68.5% precision
    from human judgments.

  abstract: The view that the representation of information structure (IS) should
    be a part of (any type of) representation of meaning is based on the fact that
    IS is a semantically relevant phenomenon. In the contribution, three arguments
    supporting this view are briefly summarized, namely, the relation of IS to the
    interpretation of negation and presupposition, the relevance of IS to the understanding
    of discourse connectivity and for the establishment and interpretation of coreference
    relations. Afterwards, possible integration of the description of the main ingredient
    of IS into a meaning representation is illustrated.

  abstract: "It is known that discourse connectives are the most salient indicators\
    \ of discourse relations. State-of-the-art parsers being developed to predict\
    \ explicit discourse connectives exploit annotated discourse corpora but a lexicon\
    \ of discourse connectives is also needed to enable further research in discourse\
    \ structure and support the development of language technologies that use these\
    \ structures for text understanding. This paper presents a lexicon of Turkish\
    \ discourse connectives built by automatic means. The lexicon has the format of\
    \ the German connective lexicon, DiMLex, where for each discourse connective,\
    \ information about the connective\u2018s orthographic variants, syntactic category\
    \ and senses are provided along with sample relations. In this paper, we describe\
    \ the data sources we used and the development steps of the lexicon."

  abstract: "This paper presents a new task-oriented meaning representation called\
    \ meta-semantics, that is designed to detect patients with early symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019\
    s disease by analyzing their language beyond a syntactic or semantic level. Meta-semantic\
    \ representation consists of three parts, entities, predicate argument structures,\
    \ and discourse attributes, that derive rich knowledge graphs. For this study,\
    \ 50 controls and 50 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are selected,\
    \ and meta-semantic representation is annotated on their speeches transcribed\
    \ in text. Inter-annotator agreement scores of 88%, 82%, and 89% are achieved\
    \ for the three types of annotation, respectively. Five analyses are made using\
    \ this annotation, depicting clear distinctions between the control and MCI groups.\
    \ Finally, a neural model is trained on features extracted from those analyses\
    \ to classify MCI patients from normal controls, showing a high accuracy of 82%\
    \ that is very promising."

  abstract: "Ellipsis is very common in language. It\u2019s necessary for natural\
    \ language processing to restore the elided elements in a sentence. However, there\u2019\
    s only a few corpora annotating the ellipsis, which draws back the automatic detection\
    \ and recovery of the ellipsis. This paper introduces the annotation of ellipsis\
    \ in Chinese sentences, using a novel graph-based representation Abstract Meaning\
    \ Representation (AMR), which has a good mechanism to restore the elided elements\
    \ manually. We annotate 5,000 sentences selected from Chinese TreeBank (CTB).\
    \ We find that 54.98% of sentences have ellipses. 92% of the ellipses are restored\
    \ by copying the antecedents\u2019 concepts. and 12.9% of them are the new added\
    \ concepts. In addition, we find that the elided element is a word or phrase in\
    \ most cases, but sometimes only the head of a phrase or parts of a phrase, which\
    \ is rather hard for the automatic recovery of ellipsis."

  abstract: This paper proposes a novel representation of event structure by separating
    verbal semantics and the meaning of argument structure constructions that verbs
    occur in. Our model demonstrates how the two meaning representations interact.
    Our model thus effectively deals with various verb construals in different argument
    structure constructions, unlike purely verb-based approaches. However, unlike
    many constructionally-based approaches, we also provide a richer representation
    of the event structure evoked by the verb meaning.

    we discuss the kind of contributions that distributional models can provide to

  abstract: "Humans have the unique ability to infer information about participants\
    \ in a scene, even if they are not mentioned in a text about that scene. Computer\
    \ systems cannot do so without explicit information about those participants.\
    \ This paper addresses the linguistic phenomenon of null-instantiated frame elements,\
    \ i.e., implicit semantic roles, and their representation in FrameNet (FN). It\
    \ motivates FN\u2019s annotation practice, and illustrates three types of null-instantiated\
    \ arguments that FrameNet tracks, noting that other lexical resources do not record\
    \ such semantic-pragmatic information, despite its need in natural language understanding\
    \ (NLU), and the elaborate efforts to create new datasets. It challenges the community\
    \ to appeal to FN data to develop more sophisticated techniques for recognizing\
    \ implicit semantic roles, and creating needed datasets. Although the annotation\
    \ of null-instantiated roles was lexicographically motivated, FN provides useful\
    \ information for text processing, and therefore must be considered in the design\
    \ of any meaning representation for natural language understanding."

    (AMR) to Korean. In this regard, it focuses on the copula construction and its
    negation and the case-stacking phenomenon thereof. To illustrate this clearly,
    we reviewed the :domain annotation scheme from various perspectives. In this process,
    the existing annotation guidelines were improved to devise annotation schemes
    for each issue under the principle of pursuing consistency and efficiency of annotation
    without distorting the characteristics of Korean.

  abstract: This paper proposes using a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model in order to identify
    the tense and aspect of verbs. The information that this classifier outputs can
    be useful for ordering events and can provide a pre-processing step to improve
    efficiency of annotating this type of information. This neural network architecture
    has been successfully employed for other sequential labeling tasks, and we show
    that it significantly outperforms the rule-based tool TMV-annotator on the Propbank
    I dataset.

  abstract: This paper announces the release of a new version of the English lexical
    resource VerbNet with substantially revised semantic representations designed
    to facilitate computer planning and reasoning based on human language. We use
    the transfer of possession and transfer of information event representations to
    illustrate both the general framework of the representations and the types of
    nuances the new representations can capture. These representations use a Generative
    Lexicon-inspired subevent structure to track attributes of event participants
    across time, highlighting oppositions and temporal and causal relations among
    the subevents.

  abstract: We propose a coreference annotation scheme as a layer on top of the Universal
    Conceptual Cognitive Annotation foundational layer, treating units in predicate-argument
    structure as a basis for entity and event mentions. We argue that this allows
    coreference annotators to sidestep some of the challenges faced in other schemes,
    which do not enforce consistency with predicate-argument structure and vary widely
    in what kinds of mentions they annotate and how. The proposed approach is examined
    with a pilot annotation study and compared with annotations from other schemes.

  abstract: Natural language understanding at the semantic level and independent of
    language variations is of great practical value. Existing approaches such as semantic
    role labeling (SRL) and abstract meaning representation (AMR) still have features
    related to the peculiarities of the particular language. In this work we describe
    various challenges and possible solutions in designing a semantic representation
    that is universal across a variety of languages.

  abstract: We detail refinements made to Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) that
    make the representation more suitable for supporting a situated dialogue system,
    where a human remotely controls a robot for purposes of search and rescue and
    reconnaissance. We propose 36 augmented AMRs that capture speech acts, tense and
    aspect, and spatial information. This linguistic information is vital for representing
    important distinctions, for example whether the robot has moved, is moving, or
    will move. We evaluate two existing AMR parsers for their performance on dialogue
    data. We also outline a model for graph-to-graph conversion, in which output from
    AMR parsers is converted into our refined AMRs. The design scheme presented here,
    though task-specific, is extendable for broad coverage of speech acts using AMR
    in future task-independent work.

  abstract: Pictures can enrich storytelling experiences. We propose a framework that
    can automatically compose a picture book by understanding story text and visualizing
    it with painting elements, i.e., characters and backgrounds. For story understanding,
    we extract key information from a story on both sentence level and paragraph level,
    including characters, scenes and actions. These concepts are organized and visualized
    in a way that depicts the development of a story. We collect a set of Chinese
    stories for children and apply our approach to compose pictures for stories. Extensive
    experiments are conducted towards story event extraction for visualization to
    demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract: Visual storytelling is the task of generating stories based on a sequence
    of images. Inspired by the recent works in neural generation focusing on controlling
    the form of text, this paper explores the idea of generating these stories in
    different personas. However, one of the main challenges of performing this task
    is the lack of a dataset of visual stories in different personas. Having said
    that, there are independent datasets for both visual storytelling and annotated
    sentences for various persona. In this paper we describe an approach to overcome
    this by getting labelled persona data from a different task and leveraging those
    annotations to perform persona based story generation. We inspect various ways
    of incorporating personality in both the encoder and the decoder representations
    to steer the generation in the target direction. To this end, we propose five
    models which are incremental extensions to the baseline model to perform the task
    at hand. In our experiments we use five different personas to guide the generation
    process. We find that the models based on our hypotheses perform better at capturing
    words while generating stories in the target persona.

  abstract: Automatically generating globally coherent stories is a challenging problem.
    Neural text generation models have been shown to perform well at generating fluent
    sentences from data, but they usually fail to keep track of the overall coherence
    of the story after a couple of sentences. Existing work that incorporates a text
    planning module succeeded in generating recipes and dialogues, but appears quite
    data-demanding. We propose a novel story generation approach that generates globally
    coherent stories from a fairly small corpus. The model exploits a symbolic text
    planning module to produce text plans, thus reducing the demand of data; a neural
    surface realization module then generates fluent text conditioned on the text
    plan. Human evaluation showed that our model outperforms various baselines by
    a wide margin and generates stories which are fluent as well as globally coherent.

  abstract: 'Neural network based approaches to automated story plot generation attempt
    to learn how to generate novel plots from a corpus of natural language plot summaries.
    Prior work has shown that a semantic abstraction of sentences called events improves
    neural plot generation and and allows one to decompose the problem into: (1) the
    generation of a sequence of events (event-to-event) and (2) the transformation
    of these events into natural language sentences (event-to-sentence). However,
    typical neural language generation approaches to event-to-sentence can ignore
    the event details and produce grammatically-correct but semantically-unrelated
    sentences. We present an ensemble-based model that generates natural language
    guided by events. Our method outperforms the baseline sequence-to-sequence model.
    Additionally, we provide results for a full end-to-end automated story generation
    system, demonstrating how our model works with existing systems designed for the
    event-to-event problem.'

  abstract: "Centrality of emotion for the stories told by humans is underpinned by\
    \ numerous studies in literature and psychology. The research in automatic storytelling\
    \ has recently turned towards emotional storytelling, in which characters\u2019\
    \ emotions play an important role in the plot development (Theune et al., 2004;\
    \ y Perez, 2007; Mendez et al., 2016). However, these studies mainly use emotion\
    \ to generate propositional statements in the form \u201CA feels affection towards\
    \ B\u201D or \u201CA confronts B\u201D. At the same time, emotional behavior does\
    \ not boil down to such propositional descriptions, as humans display complex\
    \ and highly variable patterns in communicating their emotions, both verbally\
    \ and non-verbally. In this paper, we analyze how emotions are expressed non-verbally\
    \ in a corpus of fan fiction short stories. Our analysis shows that stories written\
    \ by humans convey character emotions along various non-verbal channels. We find\
    \ that some non-verbal channels, such as facial expressions and voice characteristics\
    \ of the characters, are more strongly associated with joy, while gestures and\
    \ body postures are more likely to occur with trust. Based on our analysis, we\
    \ argue that automatic storytelling systems should take variability of emotion\
    \ into account when generating descriptions of characters\u2019 emotions."

  abstract: In text generation, generating long stories is still a challenge. Coherence
    tends to decrease rapidly as the output length increases. Especially for generated
    stories, coherence of the narrative is an important quality aspect of the output
    text. In this paper we examine how narrative coherence is attained in the submissions
    of NaNoGenMo 2018, an online text generation event where participants are challenged
    to generate a 50,000 word novel. We list the main approaches that were used to
    generate coherent narratives and link them to scientific literature. Finally,
    we give recommendations on when to use which approach.

  abstract: This study explores the relation between lexical concreteness and narrative
    text quality. We present a methodology to quantitatively measure lexical concreteness
    of a text. We apply it to a corpus of student stories, scored according to writing
    evaluation rubrics. Lexical concreteness is weakly-to-moderately related to story
    quality, depending on story-type. The relation is mostly borne by adjectives and
    nouns, but also found for adverbs and verbs.

  abstract: In this work, we deploy a logistic regression classifier to ascertain
    whether a given document belongs to the fiction or non-fiction genre. For genre
    identification, previous work had proposed three classes of features, viz., low-level
    (character-level and token counts), high-level (lexical and syntactic information)
    and derived features (type-token ratio, average word length or average sentence
    length). Using the Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV)
    algorithm, we perform feature selection experiments on an exhaustive set of nineteen
    features (belonging to all the classes mentioned above) extracted from Brown corpus
    text. As a result, two simple features viz., the ratio of the number of adverbs
    to adjectives and the number of adjectives to pronouns turn out to be the most
    significant. Subsequently, our classification experiments aimed towards genre
    identification of documents from the Brown and Baby BNC corpora demonstrate that
    the performance of a classifier containing just the two aforementioned features
    is at par with that of a classifier containing the exhaustive feature set.

  abstract: Script knowledge consists of detailed information on everyday activities.
    Such information is often taken for granted in text and needs to be inferred by
    readers. Therefore, script knowledge is a central component to language comprehension.
    Previous work on representing scripts is mostly based on extensive manual work
    or limited to scenarios that can be found with sufficient redundancy in large
    corpora. We introduce the task of scenario detection, in which we identify references
    to scripts. In this task, we address a wide range of different scripts (200 scenarios)
    and we attempt to identify all references to them in a collection of narrative
    texts. We present a first benchmark data set and a baseline model that tackles
    scenario detection using techniques from topic segmentation and text classification.

  abstract: Interesting stories often are built around interesting characters. Finding
    and detailing what makes an interesting character is a real challenge, but certainly
    a significant cue is the character personality traits. Our exploratory work tests
    the adaptability of the current personality traits theories to literal characters,
    focusing on the analysis of utterances in theatre scripts. And, at the opposite,
    we try to find significant traits for interesting characters. The preliminary
    results demonstrate that our approach is reasonable. Using machine learning for
    gaining insight into the personality traits of fictional characters can make sense.

  abstract: 'Pre-scheduled events, such as TV shows and sports games, usually garner
    considerable attention from the public. Twitter captures large volumes of discussions
    and messages related to these events, in real-time. Twitter streams related to
    pre-scheduled events are characterized by the following: (1) spikes in the volume
    of published tweets reflect the highlights of the event and (2) some of the published
    tweets make reference to the characters involved in the event, in the context
    in which they are currently portrayed in a subevent. In this paper, we take advantage
    of these characteristics to identify the highlights of pre-scheduled events from
    tweet streams and we demonstrate a method to summarize these highlights. We evaluate
    our algorithm on tweets collected around 2 episodes of a popular TV show, Game
    of Thrones, Season 7.'

  abstract: We study the problem of generating interesting endings for stories. Neural
    generative models have shown promising results for various text generation problems.
    Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models are typically trained to generate a single
    output sequence for a given input sequence. However, in the context of a story,
    multiple endings are possible. Seq2Seq models tend to ignore the context and generate
    generic and dull responses. Very few works have studied generating diverse and
    interesting story endings for the same story context. In this paper, we propose
    models which generate more diverse and interesting outputs by 1) training models
    to focus attention on important keyphrases of the story, and 2) promoting generating
    nongeneric words. We show that the combination of the two leads to more interesting
    endings.

  abstract: "As the size of investment for movie production grows bigger, the need\
    \ for predicting a movie\u2019s success in early stages has increased. To address\
    \ this need, various approaches have been proposed, mostly relying on movie reviews,\
    \ trailer movie clips, and SNS postings. However, all of these are available only\
    \ after a movie is produced and released. To enable a more earlier prediction\
    \ of a movie\u2019s performance, we propose a deep-learning based approach to\
    \ predict the success of a movie using only its plot summary text. This paper\
    \ reports the results evaluating the efficacy of the proposed method and concludes\
    \ with discussions and future work."

  abstract: The presence of toxic content has become a major problem for many online
    communities. Moderators try to limit this problem by implementing more and more
    refined comment filters, but toxic users are constantly finding new ways to circumvent
    them. Our hypothesis is that while modifying toxic content and keywords to fool
    filters can be easy, hiding sentiment is harder. In this paper, we explore various
    aspects of sentiment detection and their correlation to toxicity, and use our
    results to implement a toxicity detection tool. We then test how adding the sentiment
    information helps detect toxicity in three different real-world datasets, and
    incorporate subversion to these datasets to simulate a user trying to circumvent
    the system. Our results show sentiment information has a positive impact on toxicity
    detection.

  abstract: 'We developed a machine-learning-based method to detect video game players
    that harass teammates or opponents in chat earlier in the conversation. This real-time
    technology would allow gaming companies to intervene during games, such as issue
    warnings or muting or banning a player. In a proof-of-concept experiment on League
    of Legends data we compute and visualize evaluation metrics for a machine learning
    classifier as conversations unfold, and observe that the optimal precision and
    recall of detecting toxic players at each moment in the conversation depends on
    the confidence threshold of the classifier: the threshold should start low, and
    increase as the conversation unfolds. How fast this sliding threshold should increase
    depends on the training set size.'

  abstract: Technologies for abusive language detection are being developed and applied
    with little consideration of their potential biases. We examine racial bias in
    five different sets of Twitter data annotated for hate speech and abusive language.
    We train classifiers on these datasets and compare the predictions of these classifiers
    on tweets written in African-American English with those written in Standard American
    English. The results show evidence of systematic racial bias in all datasets,
    as classifiers trained on them tend to predict that tweets written in African-American
    English are abusive at substantially higher rates. If these abusive language detection
    systems are used in the field they will therefore have a disproportionate negative
    impact on African-American social media users. Consequently, these systems may
    discriminate against the groups who are often the targets of the abuse we are
    trying to detect.

  abstract: Discussion forum participation represents one of the crucial factors for
    learning and often the only way of supporting social interactions in online settings.
    However, as much as sharing new ideas or asking thoughtful questions contributes
    learning, verbally abusive behaviors, such as expressing negative emotions in
    online discussions, could have disproportionate detrimental effects. To provide
    means for mitigating the potential negative effects on course participation and
    learning, we developed an automated classifier for identifying communication that
    show linguistic patterns associated with hostility in online forums. In so doing,
    we employ several well-established automated text analysis tools and build on
    the common practices for handling highly imbalanced datasets and reducing the
    sensitivity to overfitting. Although still in its infancy, our approach shows
    promising results (ROC AUC .73) towards establishing a robust detector of abusive
    behaviors. We further provide an overview of the classification (linguistic and
    contextual) features most indicative of online aggression.

  abstract: Hate speech and abusive language spreading on social media need to be
    detected automatically to avoid conflict between citizen. Moreover, hate speech
    has a target, category, and level that also needs to be detected to help the authority
    in prioritizing which hate speech must be addressed immediately. This research
    discusses multi-label text classification for abusive language and hate speech
    detection including detecting the target, category, and level of hate speech in
    Indonesian Twitter using machine learning approach with Support Vector Machine
    (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest Decision Tree (RFDT) classifier and
    Binary Relevance (BR), Label Power-set (LP), and Classifier Chains (CC) as the
    data transformation method. We used several kinds of feature extractions which
    are term frequency, orthography, and lexicon features. Our experiment results
    show that in general RFDT classifier using LP as the transformation method gives
    the best accuracy with fast computational time.

  abstract: "Recent concerns over abusive behavior on their platforms have pressured\
    \ social media companies to strengthen their content moderation policies. However,\
    \ user opinions on these policies have been relatively understudied. In this paper,\
    \ we present an analysis of user responses to a September 27, 2018 announcement\
    \ about the quarantine policy on Reddit as a case study of to what extent the\
    \ discourse on content moderation is polarized by users\u2019 ideological viewpoint.\
    \ We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization\
    \ based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We\
    \ then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with\
    \ different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, finding that right-leaning users\
    \ invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how\
    \ content policies are applied. Overall, we argue for a more nuanced approach\
    \ to moderation by highlighting the intersection of behavior and ideology in considering\
    \ how abusive language is defined and regulated."

  abstract: 'The goal of any social media platform is to facilitate healthy and meaningful
    interactions among its users. But more often than not, it has been found that
    it becomes an avenue for wanton attacks. We propose an experimental study that
    has three aims: 1) to provide us with a deeper understanding of current data sets
    that focus on different types of abusive language, which are sometimes overlapping
    (racism, sexism, hate speech, offensive language, and personal attacks); 2) to
    investigate what type of attention mechanism (contextual vs. self-attention) is
    better for abusive language detection using deep learning architectures; and 3)
    to investigate whether stacked architectures provide an advantage over simple
    architectures for this task.'

  abstract: Online abusive content detection is an inherently difficult task. It has
    received considerable attention from academia, particularly within the computational
    linguistics community, and performance appears to have improved as the field has
    matured. However, considerable challenges and unaddressed frontiers remain, spanning
    technical, social and ethical dimensions. These issues constrain the performance,
    efficiency and generalizability of abusive content detection systems. In this
    article we delineate and clarify the main challenges and frontiers in the field,
    critically evaluate their implications and discuss potential solutions. We also
    highlight ways in which social scientific insights can advance research. We discuss
    the lack of support given to researchers working with abusive content and provide
    guidelines for ethical research.

  abstract: "Over the past years, the amount of online offensive speech has been growing\
    \ steadily. To successfully cope with it, machine learning are applied. However,\
    \ ML-based techniques require sufficiently large annotated datasets. In the last\
    \ years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper,\
    \ we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far.\
    \ The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two\
    \ different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly,\
    \ non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels (\u2018hate\u2019 vs. \u2018\
    no-hate\u2019). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a\
    \ fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories\
    \ in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which\
    \ reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others\
    \ and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation\
    \ scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the\
    \ identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To\
    \ demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification\
    \ experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified\
    \ data, with a state-of-the-art outcome."

  abstract: Social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram face a surge in cyberbullying
    phenomena against young users and need to develop scalable computational methods
    to limit the negative consequences of this kind of abuse. Despite the number of
    approaches recently proposed in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) research
    area for detecting different forms of abusive language, the issue of identifying
    cyberbullying phenomena at scale is still an unsolved problem. This is because
    of the need to couple abusive language detection on textual message with network
    analysis, so that repeated attacks against the same person can be identified.
    In this paper, we present a system to monitor cyberbullying phenomena by combining
    message classification and social network analysis. We evaluate the classification
    module on a data set built on Instagram messages, and we describe the cyberbullying
    monitoring user interface.

  abstract: "In this paper, we describe a workflow for the data-driven acquisition\
    \ and semantic scaling of a lexicon that covers lexical items from the lower end\
    \ of the German language register\u2014terms typically considered as rough, vulgar\
    \ or obscene. Since the fine semantic representation of grades of obscenity can\
    \ only inadequately be captured at the categorical level (e.g., obscene vs. non-obscene,\
    \ or rough vs. vulgar), our main contribution lies in applying best-worst scaling,\
    \ a rating methodology that has already been shown to be useful for emotional\
    \ language, to capture the relative strength of obscenity of lexical items. We\
    \ describe the empirical foundations for bootstrapping such a low-end lexicon\
    \ for German by starting from manually supplied lexicographic categorizations\
    \ of a small seed set of rough and vulgar lexical items and automatically enlarging\
    \ this set by means of distributional semantics. We then determine the degrees\
    \ of obscenity for the full set of all acquired lexical items by letting crowdworkers\
    \ comparatively assess their pejorative grade using best-worst scaling. This semi-automatically\
    \ enriched lexicon already comprises 3,300 lexical items and incorporates 33,000\
    \ vulgarity ratings. Using it as a seed lexicon for fully automatic lexical acquisition,\
    \ we were able to raise its coverage up to slightly more than 11,000 entries."

  abstract: We address the task of automatically detecting toxic content in user generated
    texts. We fo cus on exploring the potential for preemptive moderation, i.e., predicting
    whether a particular conversation thread will, in the future, incite a toxic comment.
    Moreover, we perform preliminary investigation of whether a model that jointly
    considers all comments in a conversation thread outperforms a model that considers
    only individual comments. Using an existing dataset of conversations among Wikipedia
    contributors as a starting point, we compile a new large-scale dataset for this
    task consisting of labeled comments and comments from their conversation threads.

  abstract: The text we see in social media suffers from lots of undesired characterstics
    like hatespeech, abusive language, insults etc. The nature of this text is also
    very different compared to the traditional text we see in news with lots of obfuscated
    words, intended typos. This poses several robustness challenges to many natural
    language processing (NLP) techniques developed for traditional text. Many techniques
    proposed in the recent times such as charecter encoding models, subword models,
    byte pair encoding to extract subwords can aid in dealing with few of these nuances.
    In our work, we analyze the effectiveness of each of the above techniques, compare
    and contrast various word decomposition techniques when used in combination with
    others. We experiment with recent advances of finetuning pretrained language models,
    and demonstrate their robustness to domain shift. We also show our approaches
    achieve state of the art performance on Wikipedia attack, toxicity datasets, and
    Twitter hatespeech dataset.

  abstract: "Hate speech detectors must be applicable across a multitude of services\
    \ and platforms, and there is hence a need for detection approaches that do not\
    \ depend on any information specific to a given platform. For instance, the information\
    \ stored about the text\u2019s author may differ between services, and so using\
    \ such data would reduce a system\u2019s general applicability. The paper thus\
    \ focuses on using exclusively text-based input in the detection, in an optimised\
    \ architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory-networks.\
    \ The hate speech detector merges two strands with character n-grams and word\
    \ embeddings to produce the final classification, and is shown to outperform comparable\
    \ previous approaches."

  abstract: 'The paper proposes an investigation on the role of populist themes and
    rhetoric in an Italian Twitter corpus of hate speech against immigrants. The corpus
    had been annotated with four new layers of analysis: Nominal Utterances, that
    can be seen as consistent with populist rhetoric; In-out-group rhetoric, a very
    common populist strategy to polarize public opinion; Slogan-like nominal utterances,
    that may convey the call for severe illiberal policies against immigrants; News,
    to recognize the role of newspapers (headlines or reference to articles) in the
    Twitter political discourse on immigration featured by hate speech.'

  abstract: The disciplines of Gender Studies and Data Science are incompatible. This
    is conventional wisdom, supported by how many computational studies simplify gender
    into an immutable binary categorization that appears crude to the critical social
    researcher. I argue that the characterization of gender norms is context specific
    and may prove valuable in constructing useful models. I show how gender can be
    framed in computational studies as a stylized repetition of acts mediated by a
    social structure, and not a possessed biological category. By conducting a review
    of existing work, I show how gender should be explored in multiplicity in computational
    research through clustering techniques, and layout how this is being achieved
    in a study in progress on gender hostility on Stack Overflow.

  abstract: The present paper introduces a theoretical model for explaining aggressive
    online comments from a sociological perspective. It is innovative as it combines
    individual, situational, and social-structural determinants of online aggression
    and tries to theoretically derive their interplay. Moreover, the paper suggests
    an empirical strategy for testing the model. The main contribution will be to
    match online commenting data with survey data containing rich background data
    of non- /aggressive online commentators.

  abstract: This work presents a speech recognition model for Tigrinya language .The
    Deep Neural Network is used to make the recognition model. The Long Short-Term
    Memory Network (LSTM), which is a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network composed
    of Long Short-Term Memory blocks, is the primary layer of our neural network model.
    The 40-dimensional features are MFCC-LDA-MLLT-fMLLR with CMN were used. The acoustic
    models are trained on features that are obtained by projecting down to 40 dimensions
    using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Moreover, speaker adaptive training
    (SAT) is done using a single feature-space maximum likelihood linear regression
    (FMLLR) transform estimated per speaker. We train and compare LSTM and DNN models
    at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models
    converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for
    relatively small sized models. Finally, the accuracy of the model is evaluated
    based on the recognition rate.

  abstract: We propose a novel Aspect-based Rating Prediction model (AspeRa) that
    estimates user rating based on review texts for the items. It is based on aspect
    extraction with neural networks and combines the advantages of deep learning and
    topic modeling. It is mainly designed for recommendations, but an important secondary
    goal of AspeRa is to discover coherent aspects of reviews that can be used to
    explain predictions or for user profiling. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
    study of AspeRa, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms
    of recommendation quality and produces interpretable aspects. This paper is an
    abridged version of our work (Nikolenko et al., 2019)

  abstract: Recognizing the arrow of time in the context of paragraphs in short stories
    is a challenging task. i.e., given only two paragraphs (excerpted from a random
    position in a short story), determining which comes first and which comes next
    is a difficult task even for humans. In this paper, we have collected and curated
    a novel dataset for tackling this challenging task. We have shown that a pre-trained
    BERT architecture achieves reasonable accuracy on the task, and outperforms RNN-based

W19-3607:
  abstract: "The significance of computers and handheld devices are not deniable in\
    \ the modern world of today. Texts are entered to these devices using word processing\
    \ programs as well as other techniques and word prediction is one of the techniques.\
    \ Word Prediction is the action of guessing or forecasting what word comes after,\
    \ based on some current information, and it is the main focus of this study. Even\
    \ though Amharic is used by a large number of populations, no significant work\
    \ is done on the topic of word sequence prediction. In this study, Amharic word\
    \ sequence prediction model is developed with statistical methods using Hidden\
    \ Markov Model by incorporating detailed Part of speech tag. Evaluation of the\
    \ model is performed using developed prototype and keystroke savings (KSS) as\
    \ a metrics. According to our experiment, prediction result using a bi-gram with\
    \ detailed Part of Speech tag model has higher KSS and it is better compared to\
    \ tri-gram model and better than those without Part of Speech tag. Therefore,\
    \ statistical approach with Detailed POS has quite good potential on word sequence\
    \ prediction for Amharic language. This research deals with designing word sequence\
    \ prediction model in Amharic language. It is a language that is spoken in eastern\
    \ Africa. One of the needs for Amharic word sequence prediction for mobile use\
    \ and other digital devices is in order to facilitate data entry and communication\
    \ in our language. Word sequence prediction is a challenging task for inflected\
    \ languages. (Arora, 2007) These kinds of languages are morphologically rich and\
    \ have enormous word forms. i.e. one word can have different forms. As Amharic\
    \ language is highly inflected language and morphologically rich it shares this\
    \ problem. (prediction, 2008) This problem makes word prediction system much more\
    \ difficult and results poor performance. Due to this reason storing all forms\
    \ in dictionary won\u2019t solve the problem as in English and other less inflected\
    \ languages. But considering other techniques that could help the predictor to\
    \ suggest the next word like a POS based prediction should be used. Previous researches\
    \ used dictionary approach with no consideration of context information. Hence\
    \ storing all forms of words in dictionary for inflected languages such as Amharic\
    \ language has been less effective. The main goal of this thesis is to implement\
    \ Amharic word prediction model that works with better prediction speed and with\
    \ narrowed search space as much as possible. We introduced two models; tags and\
    \ words and linear interpolation that use part of speech tag information in addition\
    \ to word n-grams in order to maximize the likelihood of syntactic appropriateness\
    \ of the suggestions. We believe the results found reflect this. Amharic word\
    \ sequence prediction using bi-gram model with higher POS weight and detailed\
    \ Part of speech tag gave better keystroke savings in all scenarios of our experiment.\
    \ The study followed Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). Since DSRM includes\
    \ approaches, techniques, tools, algorithms and evaluation mechanisms in the process,\
    \ we followed statistical approach with statistical language modeling and built\
    \ Amharic prediction model based on information from Part of Speech tagger. The\
    \ statistics included in the systems varies from single word frequencies to part-of-speech\
    \ tag n-grams. That means it included the statistics of Word frequencies, Word\
    \ sequence frequencies, Part-of-speech sequence frequencies and other important\
    \ information. Later on the system was evaluated using Keystroke Savings. (Lindh,\
    \ 011). Linux mint was used as the main Operation System during the frame work\
    \ design. We used corpus of 680,000 tagged words that has 31 tag sets, python\
    \ programming language and its libraries for both the part of speech tagger and\
    \ the predictor module. Other Tool that was used is the SRILIM (The SRI language\
    \ modeling toolkit) in order to generate unigram bigram and trigram count as an\
    \ input for the language model. SRILIM is toolkit that uses to build and apply\
    \ statistical language modeling. This thesis presented Amharic word sequence prediction\
    \ model using the statistical approach. We described a combined statistical and\
    \ lexical word prediction system for handling inflected languages by making use\
    \ of POS tags to build the language model. We developed Amharic language models\
    \ of bigram and trigram for the training purpose. We obtained 29% of KSS using\
    \ bigram model with detailed part ofspeech tag. Hence, Based on the experiments\
    \ carried out for this study and the results obtained, the following conclusions\
    \ were made. We concluded that employing syntactic information in the form of\
    \ Part-of-Speech (POS) n-grams promises more effective predictions. We also can\
    \ conclude data quantity, performance of POS tagger and data quality highly affects\
    \ the keystroke savings. Here in our study the tests were done on a small collection\
    \ of 100 phrases. According to our evaluation better Keystroke saving (KSS) is\
    \ achieved when using bi-gram model than the tri-gram models. We believe the results\
    \ obtained using the experiment of detailed Part of speech tags were effective\
    \ Since speed and search space are the basic issues in word sequence prediction"

  abstract: "Sexism is very common in social media and makes the boundaries of free\
    \ speech tighter for female users. Automatically flagging and removing sexist\
    \ content requires niche identification and description of the categories. In\
    \ this study, inspired by social science work, we propose three categories of\
    \ sexism toward women as follows: \u201CIndirect sexism\u201D, \u201CSexual sexism\u201D\
    \ and \u201CPhysical sexism\u201D. We build classifiers such as Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect different types of sexism and address\
    \ problems of annotation. Even though inherent non-interpretability of CNN is\
    \ a challenge for users who detect sexism, as the reason classifying a given speech\
    \ instance with regard to sexism is difficult to glance from a CNN. However, recent\
    \ research developed interpretable CNN filters for text data. In a CNN, filters\
    \ followed by different activation patterns along with global max-pooling can\
    \ help us tease apart the most important ngrams from the rest. In this paper,\
    \ we interpret a CNN model trained to classify sexism in order to understand different\
    \ categories of sexism by detecting semantic categories of ngrams and clustering\
    \ them. Then, these ngrams in each category are used to improve the performance\
    \ of the classification task. It is a preliminary work using machine learning\
    \ and natural language techniques to learn the concept of sexism and distinguishes\
    \ itself by looking at more precise categories of sexism in social media along\
    \ with an in-depth investigation of CNN\u2019s filters."

  abstract: This paper describes an automatic discourse relation alignment experiment
    as an empirical justification of the planned annotation projection approach to
    enlarge the 3600-word multilingual corpus of TED Multilingual Discourse Bank (TED-MDB).
    The experiment is carried out on a single language pair (English-Turkish) included
    in TED-MDB. The paper first describes the creation of a large corpus of English-Turkish
    bi-sentences, then it presents a sense-based experiment that automatically aligns
    the relations in the English sentences of TED-MDB with the Turkish sentences.
    The results are very close to the results obtained from an earlier semi-automatic
    post-annotation alignment experiment validated by human annotators and are encouraging
    for future annotation projection tasks.

    languages like English, which suffer from structural ambiguity. In this work,
    we solve this problem with the help of another language free from such ambiguities,
    using the parse tree of the parallel sentence in the other language, and word
    alignments. We formulate an optimization framework that encourages agreement between
    the parse trees for two languages, and solve it using a novel Dual Decomposition
    (DD) based algorithm. Experiments on the English-Hindi language pair show promising

    \ Awngi (Agew) text on the web, there is no available corpus annotated for sentiment\
    \ analysis. In this paper, we present a SA model for the Awngi language spoken\
    \ in Ethiopia, by using a supervised machine learning approach. We developed our\
    \ corpus by collecting around 1500 posts from online sources. This research is\
    \ begun to build and evaluate the model for opinionated Awngi music reviews. Thus,\
    \ pre-processing techniques have been employed to clean the data, to convert transliterations\
    \ to the native Ethiopic script for accessibility and convenience to typing and\
    \ to change the words to their base form by removing the inflectional morphemes.\
    \ After pre-processing, the corpus is manually annotated by three the language\
    \ professional for giving polarity, and rate, their level of confidence in their\
    \ selection and sentiment intensity scale values. To improve the calculation method\
    \ of feature selection and weighting and proposed a more suitable SA algorithm\
    \ for feature extraction named CHI and weight calculation named TF IDF, increasing\
    \ the proportion and weight of sentiment words in the feature words. We employed\
    \ Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\xEFve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (MxEn)\
    \ machine learning algorithms. Generally, the results are encouraging, despite\
    \ the morphological challenge in Awngi, the data cleanness and small size of data.\
    \ We are believed that the results could improve further with a larger corpus."

  abstract: Unlike comprehension-style questions, clarification questions look for
    some missing information in a given context. However, without guidance, neural
    models for question generation, similar to dialog generation models, lead to generic
    and bland questions that cannot elicit useful information. We argue that controlling
    the level of specificity of the generated questions can have useful applications
    and propose a neural clarification question generation model for the same. We
    first train a classifier that annotates a clarification question with its level
    of specificity (generic or specific) to the given context. Our results on the
    Amazon questions dataset demonstrate that training a clarification question generation
    model on specificity annotated data can generate questions with varied levels
    of specificity to the given context.

  abstract: "Standard sequential generation methods assume a pre-specified generation\
    \ order, such as text generation methods which generate words from left to right.\
    \ In this work, we propose a framework for training models of text generation\
    \ that operate in non-monotonic orders; the model directly learns good orders,\
    \ without any additional annotation. Our framework operates by generating a word\
    \ at an arbitrary position, and then recursively generating words to its left\
    \ and then words to its right, yielding a binary tree. Learning is framed as imitation\
    \ learning, including a coaching method which moves from imitating an oracle to\
    \ reinforcing the policy\u2019s own preferences. Experimental results demonstrate\
    \ that using the proposed method, it is possible to learn policies which generate\
    \ text without pre-specifying a generation order while achieving competitive performance\
    \ with conventional left-to-right generation."

  abstract: "Word embeddings are widely used in NLP for a vast range of tasks. It\
    \ was shown that word embeddings derived from text corpora reflect gender biases\
    \ in society, causing serious concern. Several recent works tackle this problem,\
    \ and propose methods for significantly reducing this gender bias in word embeddings,\
    \ demonstrating convincing results. However, we argue that this removal is superficial.\
    \ While the bias is indeed substantially reduced according to the provided bias\
    \ definition, the actual effect is mostly hiding the bias, not removing it. The\
    \ gender bias information is still reflected in the distances between \u201Cgender-neutralized\u201D\
    \ words in the debiased embeddings, and can be recovered from them. We present\
    \ a series of experiments to support this claim, for two debiasing methods. We\
    \ conclude that existing bias removal techniques are insufficient, and should\
    \ not be trusted for providing gender-neutral modeling."

  abstract: "Many natural languages assign grammatical gender also to inanimate nouns\
    \ in the language. In such languages, words that relate to the gender-marked nouns\
    \ are inflected to agree with the noun\u2019s gender. We show that this affects\
    \ the word representations of inanimate nouns, resulting in nouns with the same\
    \ gender being closer to each other than nouns with different gender. While \u201C\
    embedding debiasing\u201D methods fail to remove the effect, we demonstrate that\
    \ a careful application of methods that neutralize grammatical gender signals\
    \ from the words\u2019 context when training word embeddings is effective in removing\
    \ it. Fixing the grammatical gender bias results in a positive effect on the quality\
    \ of the resulting word embeddings, both in monolingual and cross lingual settings.\
    \ We note that successfully removing gender signals, while achievable, is not\
    \ trivial to do and that a language-specific morphological analyzer, together\
    \ with careful usage of it, are essential for achieving good results."

  abstract: 'The North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) is a comprehensive,
    hierarchical classification system for products (goods and services) that is consistent
    across the three North American countries. Beginning in 2017, the Economic Census
    will use NAPCS to produce economy-wide product tabulations. Respondents are asked
    to report data from a long, pre-specified list of potential products in a given
    industry, with some lists containing more than 50 potential products. Businesses
    have expressed the desire to alternatively supply Universal Product Codes (UPC)
    to the U. S. Census Bureau. Much work has been done around the categorization
    of products using product descriptions. No study has applied these efforts for
    the calculation of official statistics (statistics published by government agencies)
    using only the text of UPC product descriptions. The question we address in this
    paper is: Given UPC codes and their associated product descriptions, can we accurately
    predict NAPCS? We tested the feasibility of businesses submitting a spreadsheet
    with Universal Product Codes and their associated text descriptions. This novel
    strategy classified text with very high accuracy rates, all of our algorithms
    surpassed over 90 percent.'

  abstract: "Finding that explicitly modeling structures leads to better generalization,\
    \ we consider the task of predicting Cantonese pronunciations of logographs (Chinese\
    \ characters) using logographs\u2019 recursive structures. This task is a suitable\
    \ case study for two reasons. First, logographs\u2019 pronunciations depend on\
    \ structures (i.e. the hierarchies of sub-units in logographs) Second, the quality\
    \ of logographic structures is consistent since the structures are constructed\
    \ automatically using a set of rules. Thus, this task is less affected by confounds\
    \ such as varying quality between annotators. Empirical results show that modeling\
    \ structures explicitly using treeLSTM outperforms LSTM baseline, reducing prediction\
    \ error by 6.0% relative."

  abstract: Unlike major Western languages, most African languages are very low-resourced.
    Furthermore, the resources that do exist are often scattered and difficult to
    obtain and discover. As a result, the data and code for existing research has
    rarely been shared, meaning researchers struggle to reproduce reported results,
    and almost no publicly available benchmarks or leaderboards for African machine
    translation models exist. To start to address these problems, we trained neural
    machine translation models for a subset of Southern African languages on publicly-available
    datasets. We provide the code for training the models and evaluate the models
    on a newly released evaluation set, with the aim of starting a leaderboard for
    Southern African languages and spur future research in the field.

  abstract: Kurdish is a less-resourced language consisting of different dialects
    written in various scripts. Approximately 30 million people in different countries
    speak the language. The lack of corpora is one of the main obstacles in Kurdish
    language processing. In this paper, we present KTC-the Kurdish Textbooks Corpus,
    which is composed of 31 K-12 textbooks in Sorani dialect. The corpus is normalized
    and categorized into 12 educational subjects containing 693,800 tokens (110,297
    types). Our resource is publicly available for non-commercial use under the CC

  abstract: A broad range of information needs can often be stated as a question.
    Question Answering (QA) systems attempt to provide users concise answer(s) to
    natural language questions. The existing Amharic QA systems handle fact-based
    questions that usually take named entities as an answer. To deal with more complex
    information needs we developed an Amharic non-factoid QA for biography, definition,
    and description questions. A hybrid approach has been used for the question classification.
    For document filtering and answer extraction we have used lexical patterns. On
    the other hand to answer biography questions we have used a summarizer and the
    generated summary is validated using a text classifier. Our QA system is evaluated
    and has shown a promising result.

  abstract: Polysemous Language in Child Directed Speech Learning the meaning of words
    is one of the fundamental building blocks of verbal communication. Models of child
    language acquisition have generally made the simplifying assumption that each
    word appears in child-directed speech with a single meaning. To understand naturalistic
    word learning during childhood, it is essential to know whether children hear
    input that is in fact constrained to single meaning per word, or whether the environment
    naturally contains multiple senses.In this study, we use a topic modeling approach
    to automatically induce word senses from child-directed speech. Our results confirm
    the plausibility of our automated analysis approach and reveal an increasing rate
    of using multiple senses in child-directed speech, starting with corpora from
    children as early as the first year of life.

  abstract: We critique recent work on ethics in natural language processing. Those
    discussions have focused on data collection, experimental design, and interventions
    in modeling. But we argue that we ought to first understand the frameworks of
    ethics that are being used to evaluate the fairness and justice of algorithmic
    systems. Here, we begin that discussion by outlining deontological and consequentialist
    ethics, and make predictions on the research agenda prioritized by each.

  abstract: '[Multiple-submission] In the midst of a generation widely exposed to
    and influenced by media entertainment, the NLP research community has shown relatively
    little attention on the sexist comments in popular TV series. To understand sexism
    in TV series, we propose a way of collecting distant supervision dataset using
    Character Persona information with the psychological theories on sexism. We assume
    that sexist characters from TV shows are more prone to making sexist comments
    when talking about women, and show that this hypothesis is valid through experiment.
    Finally, we conduct an interesting analysis on popular TV show characters and
    successfully identify different shades of sexism that is often overlooked.'

  abstract: Detecting abusive language is a significant research topic, which has
    received a lot of attention recently. Our work focused on detecting personal attacks
    in online conversations. State-of-the-art research on this task has largely used
    deep learning with word embeddings. We explored the use of sentiment lexicons
    as well as semantic lexicons towards improving the accuracy of the baseline Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) using regular word embeddings. This is a work in progress,
    limited by time constraints and appropriate infrastructure. Our preliminary results
    showed promise for utilizing lexicons, especially semantic lexicons, for the task
    of detecting abusive language.

    neural network models developed for aspect-based sentiment analysis for entity-level
    adverse drug reaction (ADR) classification. Our goal is to explore how to represent
    local context around ADR mentions and learn an entity representation, interacting
    with its context. We conducted extensive experiments on various sources of text-based
    information, including social media, electronic health records, and abstracts
    of scientific articles from PubMed. The results show that Interactive Attention
    Neural Network (IAN) outperformed other models on four corpora in terms of macro
    F-measure. This work is an abridged version of our recent paper accepted to Programming
    and Computer Software journal in 2019.

  abstract: The semantic similarity of words forms the basis of many natural language
    processing methods. These computational similarity measures are often based on
    a mathematical comparison of vector representations of word meanings, while human
    judgments of similarity differ in lacking geometrical properties, e.g., symmetric
    similarity and triangular similarity. In this study, we propose a novel task design
    to further explore human behavior by asking whether a pair of words is deemed
    more similar depending on an immediately preceding judgment. Results from a crowdsourcing
    experiment show that people consistently judge words as more similar when primed
    by a judgment that evokes a relevant relationship. Our analysis further shows
    that word2vec similarity correlated significantly better with the out-of-context
    judgments, thus confirming the methodological differences in human-computer judgments,
    and offering a new testbed for probing the differences.

  abstract: "A common challenge in the healthcare industry today is physicians have\

    \ waiting list for further investigations. However, many medical reports available\
    \ in current clinical practice system are not yet ready for analysis using either\
    \ statistics or machine learning as they are in unstructured text format. The\
    \ complexity of medical information makes the annotation or validation of data\
    \ very challenging and thus acts as a bottleneck to apply machine learning techniques\
    \ in medical data. This study is therefore conducted to create such annotations\
    \ automatically where the computer can read radiological reports for oncologists\
    \ and mark the staging of lung cancer. This staging information is obtained using\
    \ the rule-based method implemented using the standards of Tumor Node Metastasis\
    \ (TNM) staging along with deep learning technology called Long Short Term Memory\
    \ (LSTM) to extract clinical information from the Computed Tomography (CT) text\

  abstract: Commonsense can be vital in some applications like Natural Language Understanding
    (NLU), where it is often required to resolve ambiguity arising from implicit knowledge
    and underspecification. In spite of the remarkable success of neural network approaches
    on a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, many of them struggle to react
    effectively in cases that require commonsense knowledge. In the present research,
    we take advantage of the availability of the open multilingual knowledge graph
    ConceptNet, by using it as an additional external resource in Named Entity Recognition
    (NER). Our proposed architecture involves BiLSTM layers combined with a CRF layer
    that was augmented with some features such as pre-trained word embedding layers
    and dropout layers. Moreover, apart from using word representations, we used also
    character-based representation to capture the morphological and the orthographic
    information. Our experiments and evaluations showed an improvement in the overall
    performance with +2.86 in the F1-measure. Commonsense reasonnig has been employed
    in other studies and NLP tasks but to the best of our knowledge, there is no study
    relating the integration of a commonsense knowledge base in NER.

  abstract: The United States Supreme Court plays a key role in defining the legal
    basis for gender discrimination throughout the country, yet there are few checks
    on gender bias within the court itself. In conversational turn-taking, interruptions
    have been documented as a marker of bias between speakers of different genders.
    The goal of this study is to automatically differentiate between respectful and
    disrespectful conversational turns taken during official hearings, which could
    help in detecting bias and finding remediation techniques for discourse in the
    courtroom. In this paper, I present a corpus of turns annotated by legal professionals,
    and describe the design of a semi-supervised classifier that will use acoustic
    and lexical features to analyze turn-taking at scale. On completion of annotations,
    this classifier will be trained to extract the likelihood that turns are respectful
    or disrespectful for use in studies of speech trends.

  abstract: Evaluating open-domain dialogue systems is difficult due to the diversity
    of possible correct answers. Automatic metrics such as BLEU correlate weakly with
    human annotations, resulting in a significant bias across different models and
    datasets. Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for assessing
    response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. Moreover,
    judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues, meaning that minor differences
    in evaluation configuration may lead to dissimilar results. In this paper, we
    present interpretable metrics for evaluating topic coherence by making use of
    distributed sentence representations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations
    of human judgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art
    entailment techniques. Results show that our metrics can be used as a surrogate
    for human judgment, making it easy to evaluate dialogue systems on large-scale
    datasets and allowing an unbiased estimate for the quality of the responses. This
    paper has been accepted in NAACL 2019.

  abstract: "Towards procedural fidelity in the processing of African English speech\
    \ corpora, this work demonstrates how the adaptation of machine-assisted segmentation\
    \ of phonemes and automatic extraction of acoustic values can significantly speed\
    \ up the processing of naturalistic data and make the vocalic analysis of the\
    \ varieties less impressionistic. Research in African English phonology has, till\
    \ date, been least data-driven \u2013 much less the use of comparative corpora\
    \ for cross-varietal assessments. Using over 30 hours of naturalistic data (from\
    \ 28 speakers in 5 Nigerian cities), the procedures for segmenting audio files\
    \ into phonemic units via the Munich Automatic Segmentation System (MAUS), and\
    \ the extraction of their spectral values in Praat are explained. Evidence from\
    \ the speech corpora supports a more complex vocalic inventory than attested in\
    \ previous auditory/manual-based accounts \u2013 thus reinforcing the resourcefulness\

  abstract: In recent years, studies of authorship recognition has aroused great interest
    in graph-based analysis. Modeling the writing style of each author using a network
    of co-occurrence words. However, short texts can generate some changes in the
    topology of network that cause impact on techniques of feature extraction based
    on graph topology. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of global-strategy
    and local-strategy based on complex network measurements comparing with graph2vec
    a graph embedding technique based on skip-gram model. The experiment consists
    of evaluating how each modification in the length of text affects the accuracy
    of authorship recognition on both techniques using cross-validation and machine
    learning techniques.

  abstract: 'This work is about the compilation process of parallel documents Spanish-Mixtec.
    There are not many Spanish-Mixec parallel texts and most of the sources are non-digital
    books. Due to this, we need to face the errors when digitizing the sources and
    difficulties in sentence alignment, as well as the fact that does not exist a
    standard orthography. Our parallel corpus consists of sixty texts coming from
    books and digital repositories. These documents belong to different domains: history,
    traditional stories, didactic material, recipes, ethnographical descriptions of
    each town and instruction manuals for disease prevention. We have classified this
    material in five major categories: didactic (6 texts), educative (6 texts), interpretative
    (7 texts), narrative (39 texts), and poetic (2 texts). The final total of tokens
    is 49,814 Spanish words and 47,774 Mixtec words. The texts belong to the states
    of Oaxaca (48 texts), Guerrero (9 texts) and Puebla (3 texts). According to this
    data, we see that the corpus is unbalanced in what refers to the representation
    of the different territories. While 55% of speakers are in Oaxaca, 80% of texts
    come from this region. Guerrero has the 30% of speakers and the 15% of texts and
    Puebla, with the 15% of the speakers has a representation of the 5% in the corpus.'

  abstract: Current approaches to Text Simplification focus on simplifying sentences
    individually. However, certain simplification transformations span beyond single
    sentences (e.g. joining and re-ordering sentences). In this paper, we motivate
    the need for modelling the simplification task at the document level, and assess
    the performance of sequence-to-sequence neural models in this setup. We analyse
    parallel original-simplified documents created by professional editors and show
    that there are frequent rewriting transformations that are not restricted to sentence
    boundaries. We also propose strategies to automatically evaluate the performance
    of a simplification model on these cross-sentence transformations. Our experiments
    show the inability of standard sequence-to-sequence neural models to learn these
    transformations, and suggest directions towards document-level simplification.

  abstract: 'The paper presents an unsupervised method for quickly extending a Ukrainian
    lexicon by generating paradigms and morphological feature structures for new Named
    Entities and neologisms, which are not covered by existing static morphological
    resources. This approach addresses a practical problem of modelling paradigms
    for entities created by the dynamic processes in the lexicon: this problem is
    especially serious for highly-inflected languages in domains with specialised
    or quickly changing lexicon. The method uses an unannotated Ukrainian corpus and
    a small fixed set of inflection tables, which can be found in traditional grammar
    textbooks. The advantage of the proposed approach is that updating the morphological
    lexicon does not require training or linguistic annotation, allowing fast knowledge-light
    extension of an existing static lexicon to improve morphological coverage on a
    specific corpus. The method is implemented in an open-source package on a GitHub
    repository. It can be applied to other low-resourced inflectional languages which

  abstract: "We present our work on the problem of Multiple Admissibility (MA) in\
    \ language learning. Multiple Admissibility occurs in many languages when more\
    \ than one grammatical form of a word fits syntactically and semantically in a\
    \ given context. In second language (L2) education - in particular, in intelligent\
    \ tutoring systems/computer-aided language learning (ITS/CALL) systems, which\
    \ generate exercises automatically - this implies that multiple alternative answers\
    \ are possible. We treat the problem as a grammaticality judgement task. We train\
    \ a neural network with an objective to label sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical,\
    \ using a \u201Csimulated learner corpus\u201D: a dataset with correct text, and\
    \ with artificial errors generated automatically. While MA occurs commonly in\
    \ many languages, this paper focuses on learning Russian. We present a detailed\
    \ classification of the types of constructions in Russian, in which MA is possible,\
    \ and evaluate the model using a test set built from answers provided by the users\
    \ of a running language learning system."

  abstract: 'Text normalisation in Text-to-Speech systems is a process of converting
    written expressions to their spoken forms. This task is complicated because in
    many cases the normalised form depends on the context. Furthermore, when we analysed
    languages like Croatian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian or Slovak there is additional
    difficulty related to their inflected nature. In this paper we want to show how
    to deal with this problem for one of these languages: Polish, without having a
    large dedicated data set and using solutions prepared for other NLP tasks. We
    limited our study to only numbers expressions, which are the most common non-standard
    words to normalise. The proposed solution is a combination of morphological tagger
    and transducer supported by a dictionary of numbers in their spoken forms. The
    data set used for evaluation is based on the part of 1-million word subset of
    the National Corpus of Polish. The accuracy of the described approach is presented
    with a comparison to a simple baseline and two commercial systems: Google Cloud
    Text-to-Speech and Amazon Polly.'

    Russian that consists of 7.5k sentences with gapping (as well as 15k relevant
    negative sentences) and comprises data from various genres: news, fiction, social

  abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for semi-automatically creating
    a data-to-text (D2T) corpus for Russian that can be used to learn a D2T natural
    language generation model. An error analysis of the output of an English-to-Russian
    neural machine translation system shows that 80% of the automatically translated
    sentences contain an error and that 53% of all translation errors bear on named
    entities (NE). We therefore focus on named entities and introduce two post-editing
    techniques for correcting wrongly translated NEs.

  abstract: Nowadays it is becoming more important than ever to find new ways of extracting
    useful information from the evergrowing amount of user-generated data available
    online. In this paper, we describe the creation of a data set that contains news
    articles and corresponding comments from Croatian news outlet 24 sata. Our annotation
    scheme is specifically tailored for the task of detecting stances and sentiment
    from user comments as well as assessing if commentator claims are verifiable.
    Through this data, we hope to get a better understanding of the publics viewpoint
    on various events. In addition, we also explore the potential of applying supervised
    machine learning models toautomate annotation of more data.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the first gold-standard resource for Russian annotated
    with compositionality information of noun compounds. The compound phrases are
    collected from the Universal Dependency treebanks according to part of speech
    patterns, such as ADJ+NOUN or NOUN+NOUN, using the gold-standard annotations.
    Each compound phrase is annotated by two experts and a moderator according to
    the following schema: the phrase can be either compositional, non-compositional,
    or ambiguous (i.e., depending on the context it can be interpreted both as compositional
    or non-compositional). We conduct an experimental evaluation of models and methods
    for predicting compositionality of noun compounds in unsupervised and supervised
    setups. We show that methods from previous work evaluated on the proposed Russian-language
    resource achieve the performance comparable with results on English corpora.'

    Natural Language Processing Workshop, co-located with the ACL-2019 conference.
    Eight teams participated in the competition, which covered four languages and
    five entity types. Performance for the named entity recognition task reached 90%
    F-measure, much higher than reported in the first edition of the Challenge. Seven
    teams covered all four languages, and five teams participated in the cross-lingual
    entity linking task. Detailed evaluation information is available on the shared

  abstract: This paper presents our participation at the shared task on multilingual
    named entity recognition at BSNLP2019. Our strategy is based on a standard neural
    architecture for sequence labeling. In particular, we use a mixed model which
    combines multilingualcontextual and language-specific embeddings. Our only submitted
    run is based on a voting schema using multiple models, one for each of the four
    languages of the task (Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, and Russian) and another for
    English. Results for named entity recognition are encouraging for all languages,
    varying from 60% to 83% in terms of Strict and Relaxed metrics, respectively.

    this task using the BERT model. We use a hundred languages multilingual model
    as base for transfer to the mentioned Slavic languages. Unsupervised pre-training
    of the BERT model on these 4 languages allows to significantly outperform baseline
    neural approaches and multilingual BERT. Additional improvement is achieved by
    extending BERT with a word-level CRF layer. Our system was submitted to BSNLP
    2019 Shared Task on Multilingual Named Entity Recognition and demonstrated top
    performance in multilingual setting for two competition metrics. We open-sourced
    NER models and BERT model pre-trained on the four Slavic languages.'

  abstract: We report on the participation of the JRC Text Mining and Analysis Competence
    Centre (TMA-CC) in the BSNLP-2019 Shared Task, which focuses on named-entity recognition,
    lemmatisation and cross-lingual linking. We propose a hybrid system combining
    a rule-based approach and light ML techniques. We use multilingual lexical resources
    such as JRC-NAMES and BABELNET together with a named entity guesser to recognise
    names. In a second step, we combine known names with wild cards to increase recognition
    recall by also capturing inflection variants. In a third step, we increase precision
    by filtering these name candidates with automatically learnt inflection patterns
    derived from name occurrences in large news article collections. Our major requirement
    is to achieve high precision. We achieved an average of 65% F-measure with 93%
    precision on the four languages.

  abstract: This paper reports the results of the first experiment dealing with the
    challenges of building a machine translation system for user-generated content
    involving a complex South Slavic language. We focus on translation of English
    IMDb user movie reviews into Serbian, in a low-resource scenario. We explore potentials
    and limits of (i) phrase-based and neural machine translation systems trained
    on out-of-domain clean parallel data from news articles (ii) creating additional
    synthetic in-domain parallel corpus by machine-translating the English IMDb corpus
    into Serbian. Our main findings are that morphology and syntax are better handled
    by the neural approach than by the phrase-based approach even in this low-resource
    mismatched domain scenario, however the situation is different for the lexical
    aspect, especially for person names. This finding also indicates that in general,
    machine translation of person names into Slavic languages (especially those which
    require/allow transcription) should be investigated more systematically.

  abstract: Using different neural network architectures is widely spread for many
    different NLP tasks. Unfortunately, most of the research is performed and evaluated
    only in English language and minor languages are often omitted. We believe using
    similar architectures for other languages can show interesting results. In this
    paper, we present our study on methods for improving sentiment classification
    in Slovak language. We performed several experiments for two different datasets,
    one containing customer reviews, the other one general Twitter posts. We show
    comparison of performance of different neural network architectures and also different
    word representations. We show that another improvement can be achieved by using
    a model ensemble. We performed experiments utilizing different methods of model
    ensemble. Our proposed models achieved better results than previous models for
    both datasets. Our experiments showed also other potential research areas.

  abstract: The 1st ACL workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing included
    a shared task on gendered ambiguous pronoun (GAP) resolution. This task was based
    on the coreference challenge defined in Webster et al. (2018), designed to benchmark
    the ability of systems to resolve pronouns in real-world contexts in a gender-fair
    way. 263 teams competed via a Kaggle competition, with the winning system achieving
    logloss of 0.13667 and near gender parity. We review the approaches of eleven
    systems with accepted description papers, noting their effective use of BERT (Devlin
    et al., 2018), both via fine-tuning and for feature extraction, as well as ensembling.

  abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present an empirical study on gender bias
    in text. Current research in this field is focused on detecting and correcting
    for gender bias in existing machine learning models rather than approaching the
    issue at the dataset level. The underlying motivation is to create a dataset which
    could enable machines to learn to differentiate bias writing from non-bias writing.
    A taxonomy is proposed for structural and contextual gender biases which can manifest
    themselves in text. A methodology is proposed to fetch one type of structural
    gender bias, Gender Generalization. We explore the IMDB movie review dataset and
    9 different corpora from Project Gutenberg. By filtering out irrelevant sentences,
    the remaining pool of candidate sentences are sent for human validation. A total
    of 6123 judgments are made on 1627 sentences and after a quality check on randomly
    selected sentences we obtain an accuracy of 75%. Out of the 1627 sentences, 808
    sentence were labeled as Gender Generalizations. The inter-rater reliability amongst
    labelers was of 61.14%.

  abstract: Modern models for common NLP tasks often employ machine learning techniques
    and train on journalistic, social media, or other culturally-derived text. These
    have recently been scrutinized for racial and gender biases, rooting from inherent
    bias in their training text. These biases are often sub-optimal and recent work
    poses methods to rectify them; however, these biases may shed light on actual
    racial or gender gaps in the culture(s) that produced the training text, thereby
    helping us understand cultural context through big data. This paper presents an
    approach for quantifying gender bias in word embeddings, and then using them to
    characterize statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health.
    We validate these metrics on 2018 Twitter data spanning 51 U.S. regions and 99
    countries. We correlate state and country word embedding biases with 18 international
    and 5 U.S.-based statistical gender gaps, characterizing regularities and predictive
    strength.

  abstract: "Prior work has shown that word embeddings capture human stereotypes,\
    \ including gender bias. However, there is a lack of studies testing the presence\
    \ of specific gender bias categories in word embeddings across diverse domains.\
    \ This paper aims to fill this gap by applying the WEAT bias detection method\
    \ to four sets of word embeddings trained on corpora from four different domains:\
    \ news, social networking, biomedical and a gender-balanced corpus extracted from\
    \ Wikipedia (GAP). We find that some domains are definitely more prone to gender\
    \ bias than others, and that the categories of gender bias present also vary for\
    \ each set of word embeddings. We detect some gender bias in GAP. We also propose\
    \ a simple but novel method for discovering new bias categories by clustering\
    \ word embeddings. We validate this method through WEAT\u2019s hypothesis testing\
    \ mechanism and find it useful for expanding the relatively small set of well-known\
    \ gender bias word categories commonly used in the literature."

  abstract: Gender bias is highly impacting natural language processing applications.
    Word embeddings have clearly been proven both to keep and amplify gender biases
    that are present in current data sources. Recently, contextualized word embeddings
    have enhanced previous word embedding techniques by computing word vector representations
    dependent on the sentence they appear in. In this paper, we study the impact of
    this conceptual change in the word embedding computation in relation with gender
    bias. Our analysis includes different measures previously applied in the literature
    to standard word embeddings. Our findings suggest that contextualized word embeddings
    are less biased than standard ones even when the latter are debiased.

  abstract: Bias in word representations, such as Word2Vec, has been widely reported
    and investigated, and efforts made to debias them. We apply the debiasing conceptor
    for post-processing both traditional and contextualized word embeddings. Our method
    can simultaneously remove racial and gender biases from word representations.
    Unlike standard debiasing methods, the debiasing conceptor can utilize heterogeneous
    lists of biased words without loss in performance. Finally, our empirical experiments
    show that the debiasing conceptor diminishes racial and gender bias of word representations
    as measured using the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) of Caliskan et al.
    (2017).

  abstract: "When translating from a language that does not morphologically mark information\
    \ such as gender and number into a language that does, translation systems must\
    \ \u201Cguess\u201D this missing information, often leading to incorrect translations\
    \ in the given context. We propose a black-box approach for injecting the missing\
    \ information to a pre-trained neural machine translation system, allowing to\
    \ control the morphological variations in the generated translations without changing\
    \ the underlying model or training data. We evaluate our method on an English\
    \ to Hebrew translation task, and show that it is effective in injecting the gender\
    \ and number information and that supplying the correct information improves the\
    \ translation accuracy in up to 2.3 BLEU on a female-speaker test set for a state-of-the-art\
    \ online black-box system. Finally, we perform a fine-grained syntactic analysis\
    \ of the generated translations that shows the effectiveness of our method."

  abstract: In this work, we investigate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes
    in sentiment analysis models. Such a task has implications in reducing implicit
    biases in these models, which are being applied to an increasingly wide variety
    of downstream tasks. We release a new gender-balanced dataset of 800 sentences
    pertaining to specific professions and propose a methodology for using it as a
    test bench to evaluate sentiment analysis models. We evaluate the presence of
    occupational gender stereotypes in 3 different models using our approach, and
    explore their relationship with societal perceptions of occupations.

  abstract: (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) demonstrated that pretrained word embeddings
    can inherit gender bias from the data they were trained on. We investigate how
    this bias affects downstream classification tasks, using the case study of occupation
    classification (De-Arteaga et al., 2019). We show that traditional techniques
    for debiasing embeddings can actually worsen the bias of the downstream classifier
    by providing a less noisy channel for communicating gender information. With a
    relatively minor adjustment, however, we show how these same techniques can be
    used to simultaneously reduce bias and maintain high classification accuracy.

  abstract: 'The pre-trained BERT model achieves a remarkable state of the art across
    a wide range of tasks in natural language processing. For solving the gender bias
    in gendered pronoun resolution task, I propose a novel neural network model based
    on the pre-trained BERT. This model is a type of mention score classifier and
    uses an attention mechanism with no parameters to compute the contextual representation
    of entity span, and a vector to represent the triple-wise semantic similarity
    among the pronoun and the entities. In stage 1 of the gendered pronoun resolution
    task, a variant of this model, trained in the fine-tuning approach, reduced the
    multi-class logarithmic loss to 0.3033 in the 5-fold cross-validation of training
    set and 0.2795 in testing set. Besides, this variant won the 2nd place with a
    score at 0.17289 in stage 2 of the task. The code in this paper is available at:

    the BERT language representation model (Devlin et al., 2018) and the usage of
    external datasets during the training process. The model uses hidden states from
    the intermediate BERT layers instead of the last layer. The resulting system almost

  abstract: Pronoun resolution is part of coreference resolution, the task of pairing
    an expression to its referring entity. This is an important task for natural language
    understanding and a necessary component of machine translation systems, chat bots
    and assistants. Neural machine learning systems perform far from ideally in this
    task, reaching as low as 73% F1 scores on modern benchmark datasets. Moreover,
    they tend to perform better for masculine pronouns than for feminine ones. Thus,
    the problem is both challenging and important for NLP researchers and practitioners.
    In this project, we describe our BERT-based approach to solving the problem of
    gender-balanced pronoun resolution. We are able to reach 92% F1 score and a much
    lower gender bias on the benchmark dataset shared by Google AI Language team.

  abstract: We present our 7th place solution to the Gendered Pronoun Resolution challenge,
    which uses BERT without fine-tuning and a novel augmentation strategy designed
    for contextual embedding token-level tasks. Our method anonymizes the referent
    by replacing candidate names with a set of common placeholder names. Besides the
    usual benefits of effectively increasing training data size, this approach diversifies
    idiosyncratic information embedded in names. Using same set of common first names
    can also help the model recognize names better, shorten token length, and remove
    gender and regional biases associated with names. The system scored 0.1947 log
    loss in stage 2, where the augmentation contributed to an improvements of 0.04.
    Post-competition analysis shows that, when using different embedding layers, the
    system scores 0.1799 which would be third place.

  abstract: The resolution of ambiguous pronouns is a longstanding challenge in Natural
    Language Understanding. Recent studies have suggested gender bias among state-of-the-art
    coreference resolution systems. As an example, Google AI Language team recently
    released a gender-balanced dataset and showed that performance of these coreference
    resolvers is significantly limited on the dataset. In this paper, we propose an
    extractive question answering (QA) formulation of pronoun resolution task that
    overcomes this limitation and shows much lower gender bias (0.99) on their dataset.
    This system uses fine-tuned representations from the pre-trained BERT model and
    outperforms the existing baseline by a significant margin (22.2% absolute improvement
    in F1 score) without using any hand-engineered features. This QA framework is
    equally performant even without the knowledge of the candidate antecedents of
    the pronoun. An ensemble of QA and BERT-based multiple choice and sequence classification
    models further improves the F1 (23.3% absolute improvement upon the baseline).
    This ensemble model was submitted to the shared task for the 1st ACL workshop
    on Gender Bias for Natural Language Processing. It ranked 9th on the final official
    leaderboard.

  abstract: This paper presents a strong set of results for resolving gendered ambiguous
    pronouns on the Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns shared task. The model presented here
    draws upon the strengths of state-of-the-art language and coreference resolution
    models, and introduces a novel evidence-based deep learning architecture. Injecting
    evidence from the coreference models compliments the base architecture, and analysis
    shows that the model is not hindered by their weaknesses, specifically gender
    bias. The modularity and simplicity of the architecture make it very easy to extend
    for further improvement and applicable to other NLP problems. Evaluation on GAP
    test data results in a state-of-the-art performance at 92.5% F1 (gender bias of
    0.97), edging closer to the human performance of 96.6%. The end-to-end solution
    presented here placed 1st in the Kaggle competition, winning by a significant
    lead.

  abstract: Neural machine translation has significantly pushed forward the quality
    of the field. However, there are remaining big issues with the output translations
    and one of them is fairness. Neural models are trained on large text corpora which
    contain biases and stereotypes. As a consequence, models inherit these social
    biases. Recent methods have shown results in reducing gender bias in other natural
    language processing tools such as word embeddings. We take advantage of the fact
    that word embeddings are used in neural machine translation to propose a method
    to equalize gender biases in neural machine translation using these representations.
    Specifically, we propose, experiment and analyze the integration of two debiasing
    techniques over GloVe embeddings in the Transformer translation architecture.
    We evaluate our proposed system on the WMT English-Spanish benchmark task, showing
    gains up to one BLEU point. As for the gender bias evaluation, we generate a test
    set of occupations and we show that our proposed system learns to equalize existing
    biases from the baseline system.

  abstract: The impressive progress in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
    has increased the awareness of some of the biases these NLP systems have with
    regards to gender identities. In this paper, we propose an approach to extend
    biased single-output gender-blind NLP systems with gender-specific alternative
    reinflections. We focus on Arabic, a gender-marking morphologically rich language,
    in the context of machine translation (MT) from English, and for first-person-singular
    constructions only. Our contributions are the development of a system-independent
    gender-awareness wrapper, and the building of a corpus for training and evaluating
    first-person-singular gender identification and reinflection in Arabic. Our results
    successfully demonstrate the viability of this approach with 8% relative increase
    in Bleu score for first-person-singular feminine, and 5.3% comparable increase
    for first-person-singular masculine on top of a state-of-the-art gender-blind
    MT system on a held-out test set.

  abstract: Contextual word embeddings such as BERT have achieved state of the art
    performance in numerous NLP tasks. Since they are optimized to capture the statistical
    properties of training data, they tend to pick up on and amplify social stereotypes
    present in the data as well. In this study, we (1) propose a template-based method
    to quantify bias in BERT; (2) show that this method obtains more consistent results
    in capturing social biases than the traditional cosine based method; and (3) conduct
    a case study, evaluating gender bias in a downstream task of Gender Pronoun Resolution.
    Although our case study focuses on gender bias, the proposed technique is generalizable
    to unveiling other biases, including in multiclass settings, such as racial and
    religious biases.

  abstract: Ethics regarding social bias has recently thrown striking issues in natural
    language processing. Especially for gender-related topics, the need for a system
    that reduces the model bias has grown in areas such as image captioning, content
    recommendation, and automated employment. However, detection and evaluation of
    gender bias in the machine translation systems are not yet thoroughly investigated,
    for the task being cross-lingual and challenging to define. In this paper, we
    propose a scheme for making up a test set that evaluates the gender bias in a
    machine translation system, with Korean, a language with gender-neutral pronouns.
    Three word/phrase sets are primarily constructed, each incorporating positive/negative
    expressions or occupations; all the terms are gender-independent or at least not
    biased to one side severely. Then, additional sentence lists are constructed concerning
    formality of the pronouns and politeness of the sentences. With the generated
    sentence set of size 4,236 in total, we evaluate gender bias in conventional machine
    translation systems utilizing the proposed measure, which is termed here as translation
    gender bias index (TGBI). The corpus and the code for evaluation is available
    on-line.

  abstract: This work attempts to explain the types of computation that neural networks
    can perform by relating them to automata. We first define what it means for a
    real-time network with bounded precision to accept a language. A measure of network
    memory follows from this definition. We then characterize the classes of languages
    acceptable by various recurrent networks, attention, and convolutional networks.
    We find that LSTMs function like counter machines and relate convolutional networks
    to the subregular hierarchy. Overall, this work attempts to increase our understanding
    and ability to interpret neural networks through the lens of theory. These theoretical
    insights help explain neural computation, as well as the relationship between
    neural networks and natural language grammar.

  abstract: While sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models achieve state-of-the-art performance
    in many natural language processing tasks, they can be too slow for real-time
    applications. One performance bottleneck is predicting the most likely next token
    over a large vocabulary; methods to circumvent this bottleneck are a current research
    topic. We focus specifically on using seq2seq models for semantic parsing, where
    we observe that grammars often exist which specify valid formal representations
    of utterance semantics. By developing a generic approach for restricting the predictions
    of a seq2seq model to grammatically permissible continuations, we arrive at a
    widely applicable technique for speeding up semantic parsing. The technique leads
    to a 74% speed-up on an in-house dataset with a large vocabulary, compared to
    the same neural model without grammatical restrictions

  abstract: We analyse Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to understand the significance
    of multiple LSTM layers. We argue that the Weighted Finite-state Automata (WFA)
    trained using a spectral learning algorithm are helpful to analyse RNNs. Our results
    suggest that multiple LSTM layers in RNNs help learning distributed hidden states,
    but have a smaller impact on the ability to learn long-term dependencies. The
    analysis is based on the empirical results, however relevant theory (whenever
    possible) was discussed to justify and support our conclusions.

  abstract: In order to successfully model Long Distance Dependencies (LDDs) it is
    necessary to under-stand the full-range of the characteristics of the LDDs exhibited
    in a target dataset. In this paper, we use Strictly k-Piecewise languages to generate
    datasets with various properties. We then compute the characteristics of the LDDs
    in these datasets using mutual information and analyze the impact of factors such
    as (i) k, (ii) length of LDDs, (iii) vocabulary size, (iv) forbidden strings,
    and (v) dataset size. This analysis reveal that the number of interacting elements
    in a dependency is an important characteristic of LDDs. This leads us to the challenge
    of modelling multi-element long-distance dependencies. Our results suggest that
    attention mechanisms in neural networks may aide in modeling datasets with multi-element
    long-distance dependencies. However, we conclude that there is a need to develop
    more efficient attention mechanisms to address this issue.

  abstract: In this paper, we systematically assess the ability of standard recurrent
    networks to perform dynamic counting and to encode hierarchical representations.
    All the neural models in our experiments are designed to be small-sized networks
    both to prevent them from memorizing the training sets and to visualize and interpret
    their behaviour at test time. Our results demonstrate that the Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) networks can learn to recognize the well-balanced parenthesis language
    (Dyck-1) and the shuffles of multiple Dyck-1 languages, each defined over different
    parenthesis-pairs, by emulating simple real-time k-counter machines. To the best
    of our knowledge, this work is the first study to introduce the shuffle languages
    to analyze the computational power of neural networks. We also show that a single-layer
    LSTM with only one hidden unit is practically sufficient for recognizing the Dyck-1
    language. However, none of our recurrent networks was able to yield a good performance
    on the Dyck-2 language learning task, which requires a model to have a stack-like
    mechanism for recognition.

  abstract: "We address the issue of acquiring quality annotations of hedging words\
    \ and phrases, linguistic phenomenona in which words, sounds, or other constructions\
    \ are used to express ambiguity or uncertainty. Due to the limited availability\
    \ of existing corpora annotated for hedging, linguists and other language scientists\
    \ have been constrained as to the extent they can study this phenomenon. In this\
    \ paper, we introduce a new method of acquiring hedging annotations via crowdsourcing,\
    \ based on reformulating the task of labeling hedges as a simple word sense disambiguation\
    \ task. We also introduce a new hedging corpus we have constructed by applying\
    \ this method, a collection of forum posts annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk.\
    \ We found that the crowdsourced judgments we obtained had an inter-annotator\
    \ agreement of 92.89% (Fleiss\u2019 Kappa=0.751) and, when comparing a subset\
    \ of these annotations to an expert-annotated gold standard, an accuracy of 96.65%."

  abstract: We build a reference for the task of Open Information Extraction, on five
    documents. We tentatively resolve a number of issues that arise, including coreference
    and granularity, and we take steps toward addressing inference, a significant
    problem. We seek to better pinpoint the requirements for the task. We produce
    our annotation guidelines specifying what is correct to extract and what is not.
    In turn, we use this reference to score existing Open IE systems. We address the
    non-trivial problem of evaluating the extractions produced by systems against
    the reference tuples, and share our evaluation script. Among seven compared extractors,
    we find the MinIE system to perform best.

  abstract: 'The perspective of being able to crowd-source coherence relations bears
    the promise of acquiring annotations for new texts quickly, which could then increase
    the size and variety of discourse-annotated corpora. It would also open the avenue
    to answering new research questions: Collecting annotations from a larger number
    of individuals per instance would allow to investigate the distribution of inferred
    relations, and to study individual differences in coherence relation interpretation.
    However, annotating coherence relations with untrained workers is not trivial.
    We here propose a novel two-step annotation procedure, which extends an earlier
    method by Scholman and Demberg (2017a). In our approach, coherence relation labels
    are inferred from connectives that workers insert into the text. We show that
    the proposed method leads to replicable coherence annotations, and analyse the
    agreement between the obtained relation labels and annotations from PDTB and RSTDT
    on the same texts.'

  abstract: Pairs of sentences, phrases, or other text pieces can hold semantic relations
    such as paraphrasing, textual entailment, contradiction, specificity, and semantic
    similarity. These relations are usually studied in isolation and no dataset exists
    where they can be compared empirically. Here we present a corpus annotated with
    these relations and the analysis of these results. The corpus contains 520 sentence
    pairs, annotated with these relations. We measure the annotation reliability of
    each individual relation and we examine their interactions and correlations. Among
    the unexpected results revealed by our analysis is that the traditionally considered
    direct relationship between paraphrasing and bi-directional entailment does not
    hold in our data.

  abstract: To date, corpus and computational linguistic work on written language
    acquisition has mostly dealt with second language learners who have usually already
    mastered orthography acquisition in their first language. In this paper, we present
    the Litkey Corpus, a richly-annotated longitudinal corpus of written texts produced
    by primary school children in Germany from grades 2 to 4. The paper focuses on
    the (semi-)automatic annotation procedure at various linguistic levels, which
    include POS tags, features of the word-internal structure (phonemes, syllables,
    morphemes) and key orthographic features of the target words as well as a categorization
    of spelling errors. Comprehensive evaluations show that high accuracy was achieved
    on all levels, making the Litkey Corpus a useful resource for corpus-based research
    on literacy acquisition of German primary school children and for developing NLP
    tools for educational purposes. The corpus is freely available under https://www.linguistics.rub.de/litkeycorpus/.

  abstract: Materials science literature contains millions of materials synthesis
    procedures described in unstructured natural language text. Large-scale analysis
    of these synthesis procedures would facilitate deeper scientific understanding
    of materials synthesis and enable automated synthesis planning. Such analysis
    requires extracting structured representations of synthesis procedures from the
    raw text as a first step. To facilitate the training and evaluation of synthesis
    extraction models, we introduce a dataset of 230 synthesis procedures annotated
    by domain experts with labeled graphs that express the semantics of the synthesis
    sentences. The nodes in this graph are synthesis operations and their typed arguments,
    and labeled edges specify relations between the nodes. We describe this new resource
    in detail and highlight some specific challenges to annotating scientific text
    with shallow semantic structure. We make the corpus available to the community
    to promote further research and development of scientific information extraction
    systems.

  abstract: Primary data from small, low-resource languages of Oceania have only recently
    become available through language documentation. In our study, we explore corpus
    data of five Oceanic languages of Melanesia which are known to be mood-prominent
    (in the sense of Bhat, 1999). In order to find out more about tense, aspect, modality,
    and polarity, we tagged these categories in a subset of our corpora. For the category
    of modality, we developed a novel tag set (MelaTAMP, 2017), which categorizes
    clauses into factual, possible, and counterfactual. Based on an analysis of the
    inter-annotator consistency, we argue that our tag set for the modal domain is
    efficient for our subject languages and might be useful for other languages and
    purposes.

  abstract: The interoperability between lemmatized corpora of Latin and other resources
    that use the lemma as indexing key is hampered by the multiple lemmatization strategies
    that different projects adopt. In this paper we discuss how we tackle the challenges
    raised by harmonizing different lemmatization criteria in the context of a project
    that aims to connect linguistic resources for Latin using the Linked Data paradigm.
    The paper introduces the architecture supporting an open-ended, lemma-based Knowledge
    Base, built to make textual and lexical resources for Latin interoperable. Particularly,
    the paper describes the inclusion into the Knowledge Base of its lexical basis,
    of a word formation lexicon and of a lemmatized and syntactically annotated corpus.

  abstract: Corpora curated by experts have sustained Natural Language Processing
    mainly in English, but the expensiveness of corpora creation is a barrier for
    the development in further languages. Thus, we propose a corpus generation strategy
    that only requires a machine translation system between English and the target
    language in both directions, where we filter the best translations by computing
    automatic translation metrics and the task performance score. By studying Reading
    Comprehension in Spanish and Word Sense Disambiguation in Portuguese, we identified
    that a more quality-oriented metric has high potential in the corpora selection
    without degrading the task performance. We conclude that it is possible to systematise
    the building of quality corpora using machine translation and automatic metrics,
    besides some prior effort to clean and process the data.

  abstract: Understanding what is expected of academic writing can be difficult for
    novice writers to assimilate, and recent years have seen several automated tools
    become available to support academic writing. Our work presents a framework for
    annotating features of the Related Work section of academic writing, that supports

  abstract: "Understanding the inferential principles underpinning an argument is\
    \ essential to the proper interpretation and evaluation of persuasive discourse.\
    \ Argument schemes capture the conventional patterns of reasoning appealed to\
    \ in persuasion. The empirical study of these patterns relies on the availability\
    \ of data about the actual use of argumentation in communicative practice. Annotated\
    \ corpora of argument schemes, however, are scarce, small, and unrepresentative.\
    \ Aiming to address this issue, we present one step in the development of improved\
    \ datasets by integrating the Argument Scheme Key \u2013 a novel annotation method\
    \ based on one of the most popular typologies of argument schemes \u2013 into\
    \ the widely used OVA software for argument analysis."

  abstract: This paper presents the identification of formulaic sequences in the reference
    corpus of spoken Slovenian and their annotation in terms of syntactic structure,
    pragmatic function and lexicographic relevance. The annotation campaign, specific
    in terms of setting, subjectivity and the multifunctionality of items under investigation,
    resulted in a preliminary lexicon of formulaic sequences in spoken Slovenian with
    immediate potential for future explorations in formulaic language research. This
    is especially relevant for the notable number of identified multi-word expressions
    with discourse-structuring and stance-marking functions, which have often been
    overlooked by traditional phraseology research.

  abstract: We present a discourse annotation study, in which an annotation method
    based on Questions under Discussion (QuD) is applied to Italian data. The results
    of our inter-annotator agreement analysis show that the QUD-based approach, originally
    spelled out for English and German, can successfully be transferred cross-linguistically,
    supporting good agreement for the annotation of central information structure
    notions such as focus and non-at-issueness. Our annotation and interannotator
    agreement study on Italian authentic data confirms the cross-linguistic applicability
    of the QuD-based approach.

  abstract: Definition extraction has been a popular topic in NLP research for well
    more than a decade, but has been historically limited to well-defined, structured,
    and narrow conditions. In reality, natural language is messy, and messy data requires
    both complex solutions and data that reflects that reality. In this paper, we
    present a robust English corpus and annotation schema that allows us to explore
    the less straightforward examples of term-definition structures in free and semi-structured
    text.

  abstract: "The vast amount of research introducing new corpora and techniques for\
    \ semi-automatically annotating corpora shows the important role that datasets\
    \ play in today\u2019s research, especially in the machine learning community.\
    \ This rapid development raises concerns about the quality of the datasets created\
    \ and consequently of the models trained, as recently discussed with respect to\
    \ the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. In this work we conduct an annotation\
    \ experiment based on a small subset of the SICK corpus. The experiment reveals\
    \ several problems in the annotation guidelines, and various challenges of the\
    \ NLI task itself. Our quantitative evaluation of the experiment allows us to\
    \ assign our empirical observations to specific linguistic phenomena and leads\
    \ us to recommendations for future annotation tasks, for NLI and possibly for\
    \ other tasks."

  abstract: This paper investigates the use of explicitly signalled discourse relations
    in persuasive texts. We present a corpus study where we control for speaker and
    topic and show that the distribution of different discourse connectives varies
    considerably across different discourse settings. While this variation can be
    explained by genre differences, we also observe variation regarding the distribution
    of discourse relations across different settings. This variation, however, cannot
    be easily explained by genre differences. We argue that the differences regarding
    the use of discourse relations reflects different strategies of persuasion and
    that these might be due to audience design.

  abstract: We present a more efficient version of the e-magyar NLP pipeline for Hungarian
    called emtsv. It integrates Hungarian NLP tools in a framework whose individual
    modules can be developed or replaced independently and allows new ones to be added.
    The design also allows convenient investigation and manual correction of the data
    flow from one module to another. The improvements we publish include effective
    communication between the modules and support of the use of individual modules
    both in the chain and standing alone. Our goals are accomplished using extended
    tsv (tab separated values) files, a simple, uniform, generic and self-documenting
    input/output format. Our vision is maintaining the system for a long time and
    making it easier for external developers to fit their own modules into the system,
    thus sharing existing competencies in the field of processing Hungarian, a mid-resourced
    language. The source code is available under LGPL 3.0 license at https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/emtsv

  abstract: "In this paper, we present the current version of two different treebanks,\
    \ the re-annotation of the Turkish PUD Treebank and the first annotation of the\
    \ Turkish National Corpus Universal Dependency (henceforth TNC-UD). The annotation\
    \ of both treebanks, the Turkish PUD Treebank and TNC-UD, was carried out based\
    \ on the decisions concerning linguistic adequacy of re-annotation of the Turkish\
    \ IMST-UD Treebank (T\xFCrk et. al., forthcoming). Both of the treebanks were\
    \ annotated with the same annotation process and morphological and syntactic analyses.\
    \ The TNC-UD is planned to have 10,000 sentences. In this paper, we will present\
    \ the first 500 sentences along with the annotation PUD Treebank. Moreover, this\
    \ paper also offers the parsing results of a graph-based neural parser on the\
    \ previous and re-annotated PUD, as well as the TNC-UD. In light of the comparisons,\
    \ even though we observe a slight decrease in the attachment scores of the Turkish\
    \ PUD treebank, we demonstrate that the annotation of the TNC-UD improves the\
    \ parsing accuracy of Turkish. In addition to the treebanks, we have also constructed\
    \ a custom annotation software with advanced filtering and morphological editing\
    \ options. Both the treebanks, including a full edit-history and the annotation\
    \ guidelines, and the custom software are publicly available under an open license\

  abstract: We present a data set of 1460 Hindi-English code-mixed tweets consisting
    of 20,949 tokens labelled with Proposition Bank labels marking their semantic
    roles. We created verb frames for complex predicates present in the corpus and
    formulated mappings from Paninian dependency labels to Proposition Bank labels.
    With the help of these mappings and the dependency tree, we propose a baseline
    rule based system for Semantic Role Labelling of Hindi-English code-mixed data.
    We obtain an accuracy of 96.74% for Argument Identification and are able to further
    classify 73.93% of the labels correctly. While there is relevant ongoing research
    on Semantic Role Labelling and on building tools for code-mixed social media data,
    this is the first attempt at labelling semantic roles in code-mixed data, to the
    best of our knowledge.

  abstract: In this paper we present a new annotation scheme for the Sejong part-of-speech
    tagged corpus based on Universal Dependencies style annotation. By using a new
    annotation scheme, we can produce Sejong-style morphological analysis and part-of-speech
    tagging results which have been the de facto standard for Korean language processing.
    We also explore the possibility of doing named-entity recognition and semantic-role
    labelling for Korean using the new annotation scheme.

  abstract: "Author profiling is the identification of an author\u2019s gender, age,\
    \ and language from his/her texts. With the increasing trend of using Twitter\
    \ as a means to express thought, profiling the gender of an author from his/her\
    \ tweets has become a challenge. Although several datasets in different languages\
    \ have been released on this problem, there is still a need for multilingualism.\
    \ In this work, we propose a dataset of tweets of Turkish Twitter users which\
    \ are labeled with their gender information. The dataset has 3368 users in training\
    \ set and 1924 users in test set where each user has 100 tweets. The dataset is\
    \ publicly available."

  abstract: Lexical simplification systems replace complex words with simple ones
    based on a model of which words are complex in context. We explore how users can
    help train complex word identification models through labelling more efficiently
    and reliably. We show that using an interface where annotators make comparative
    rather than binary judgments leads to more reliable and consistent labels, and
    explore whether comparative judgments may provide a faster way for collecting
    labels.

  abstract: "Today\u2019s widely used annotation tools were designed for annotating\
    \ typically short textual mentions of entities or relations, making their interface\
    \ cumbersome to use for long(er) stretches of text, e.g, sentences running over\
    \ several lines in a document. They also lack systematic support for hierarchically\
    \ structured labels, i.e., one label being conceptually more general than another\
    \ (e.g., anamnesis in relation to family anamnesis). Moreover, as a more fundamental\
    \ shortcoming of today\u2019s tools, they provide no continuous quality con trol\
    \ mechanisms for the annotation process, an essential feature to intrinsically\
    \ support iterative cycles in the development of annotation guidelines. We alleviated\
    \ these problems by developing WAT-SL 2.0, an open-source web-based annotation\
    \ tool for long-segment labeling, hierarchically structured label sets and built-ins\
    \ for quality control."

  abstract: In this article, an ongoing research is presented, the immediate goal
    of which is to create a corpus annotated with semantic role labels for Hungarian
    that can be used to train a parser-based system capable of formulating relevant
    questions about the text it processes. We briefly describe the objectives of our
    research, our efforts at eliminating errors in the Hungarian Universal Dependencies
    corpus, which we use as the base of our annotation effort, at creating a Hungarian
    verbal argument database annotated with thematic roles, at classifying adjuncts,
    and at matching verbal argument frames to specific occurrences of verbs and participles
    in the corpus.

  abstract: Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a recent and prominent semantic
    representation with good acceptance and several applications in the Natural Language
    Processing area. For English, there is a large annotated corpus (with approximately
    39K sentences) that supports the research with the representation. However, to
    the best of our knowledge, there is only one restricted corpus for Portuguese,
    which contains 1,527 sentences. In this context, this paper presents an effort
    to build a general purpose AMR-annotated corpus for Brazilian Portuguese by translating
    and adapting AMR English guidelines. Our results show that such approach is feasible,
    but there are some challenging phenomena to solve. More than this, efforts are
    necessary to increase the coverage of the corresponding lexical resource that
    supports the annotation.

  abstract: Progress in Machine Learning is often driven by the availability of large
    datasets, and consistent evaluation metrics for comparing modeling approaches.
    To this end, we present a repository of conversational datasets consisting of
    hundreds of millions of examples, and a standardised evaluation procedure for
    conversational response selection models using 1-of-100 accuracy. The repository
    contains scripts that allow researchers to reproduce the standard datasets, or
    to adapt the pre-processing and data filtering steps to their needs. We introduce
    and evaluate several competitive baselines for conversational response selection,
    whose implementations are shared in the repository, as well as a neural encoder
    model that is trained on the entire training set.

  abstract: Conversational machine comprehension (CMC) requires understanding the
    context of multi-turn dialogue. Using BERT, a pretraining language model, has
    been successful for single-turn machine comprehension, while modeling multiple
    turns of question answering with BERT has not been established because BERT has
    a limit on the number and the length of input sequences. In this paper, we propose
    a simple but effective method with BERT for CMC. Our method uses BERT to encode
    a paragraph independently conditioned with each question and each answer in a
    multi-turn context. Then, the method predicts an answer on the basis of the paragraph
    representations encoded with BERT. The experiments with representative CMC datasets,
    QuAC and CoQA, show that our method outperformed recently published methods (+0.8
    F1 on QuAC and +2.1 F1 on CoQA). In addition, we conducted a detailed analysis
    of the effects of the number and types of dialogue history on the accuracy of
    CMC, and we found that the gold answer history, which may not be given in an actual
    conversation, contributed to the model performance most on both datasets.

  abstract: Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models have witnessed a notable success
    in generating natural conversational exchanges. Notwithstanding the syntactically
    well-formed responses generated by these neural network models, they are prone
    to be acontextual, short and generic. In this work, we introduce a Topical Hierarchical
    Recurrent Encoder Decoder (THRED), a novel, fully data-driven, multi-turn response
    generation system intended to produce contextual and topic-aware responses. Our
    model is built upon the basic Seq2Seq model by augmenting it with a hierarchical
    joint attention mechanism that incorporates topical concepts and previous interactions
    into the response generation. To train our model, we provide a clean and high-quality
    conversational dataset mined from Reddit comments. We evaluate THRED on two novel
    automated metrics, dubbed Semantic Similarity and Response Echo Index, as well
    as with human evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model
    is able to generate more diverse and contextually relevant responses compared
    to the strong baselines.

  abstract: Response suggestion is an important task for building human-computer conversation
    systems. Recent approaches to conversation modeling have introduced new model
    architectures with impressive results, but relatively little attention has been
    paid to whether these models would be practical in a production setting. In this
    paper, we describe the unique challenges of building a production retrieval-based
    conversation system, which selects outputs from a whitelist of candidate responses.
    To address these challenges, we propose a dual encoder architecture which performs
    rapid inference and scales well with the size of the whitelist. We also introduce
    and compare two methods for generating whitelists, and we carry out a comprehensive
    analysis of the model and whitelists. Experimental results on a large, proprietary
    help desk chat dataset, including both offline metrics and a human evaluation,
    indicate production-quality performance and illustrate key lessons about conversation
    modeling in practice.

  abstract: This theoretical paper identifies a need for a definition of asymmetric
    co-creativity where creativity is expected from the computational agent but not
    from the human user. Our co-operative creativity framework takes into account
    that the computational agent has a message to convey in a co-operative fashion,
    which introduces a trade-off on how creative the computer can be. The requirements
    of co-operation are identified from an interdisciplinary point of view. We divide
    co-operative creativity in message creativity, contextual creativity and communicative
    creativity. Finally these notions are applied in the context of the Peace Machine
    system concept.

  abstract: "We propose a novel method for selecting coherent and diverse responses\
    \ for a given dialogue context. The proposed method re-ranks response candidates\
    \ generated from conversational models by using event causality relations between\
    \ events in a dialogue history and response candidates (e.g., \u201Cbe stressed\
    \ out\u201D precedes \u201Crelieve stress\u201D). We use distributed event representation\
    \ based on the Role Factored Tensor Model for a robust matching of event causality\
    \ relations due to limited event causality knowledge of the system. Experimental\
    \ results showed that the proposed method improved coherency and dialogue continuity\
    \ of system responses."

  abstract: 'Goal-oriented dialogue in complex domains is an extremely challenging
    problem and there are relatively few datasets. This task provided two new resources
    that presented different challenges: one was focused but small, while the other
    was large but diverse. We also considered several new variations on the next utterance
    selection problem: (1) increasing the number of candidates, (2) including paraphrases,
    and (3) not including a correct option in the candidate set. Twenty teams participated,
    developing a range of neural network models, including some that successfully
    incorporated external data to boost performance. Both datasets have been publicly
    released, enabling future work to build on these results, working towards robust
    goal-oriented dialogue systems.'

  abstract: We tackle the problem of context reconstruction in Chinese dialogue, where
    the task is to replace pronouns, zero pronouns, and other referring expressions
    with their referent nouns so that sentences can be processed in isolation without
    context. Following a standard decomposition of the context reconstruction task
    into referring expression detection and coreference resolution, we propose a novel
    end-to-end architecture for separately and jointly accomplishing this task. Key
    features of this model include POS and position encoding using CNNs and a novel
    pronoun masking mechanism. One perennial problem in building such models is the
    paucity of training data, which we address by augmenting previously-proposed methods
    to generate a large amount of realistic training data. The combination of more
    data and better models yields accuracy higher than the state-of-the-art method
    in coreference resolution and end-to-end context reconstruction.

  abstract: The uncertainties of language and the complexity of dialogue contexts
    make accurate dialogue state tracking one of the more challenging aspects of dialogue
    processing. To improve state tracking quality, we argue that relationships between
    different aspects of dialogue state must be taken into account as they can often
    guide a more accurate interpretation process. To this end, we present an energy-based
    approach to dialogue state tracking as a structured classification task. The novelty
    of our approach lies in the use of an energy network on top of a deep learning
    architecture to explore more signal correlations between network variables including
    input features and output labels. We demonstrate that the energy-based approach
    improves the performance of a deep learning dialogue state tracker towards state-of-the-art
    results without the need for many of the other steps required by current state-of-the-art
    methods.

  abstract: 'We describe and validate a metric for estimating multi-class classifier
    performance based on cross-validation and adapted for improvement of small, unbalanced
    natural-language datasets used in chatbot design. Our experiences draw upon building
    recruitment chatbots that mediate communication between job-seekers and recruiters
    by exposing the ML/NLP dataset to the recruiting team. Evaluation approaches must
    be understandable to various stakeholders, and useful for improving chatbot performance.
    The metric, nex-cv, uses negative examples in the evaluation of text classification,
    and fulfils three requirements. First, it is actionable: it can be used by non-developer
    staff. Second, it is not overly optimistic compared to human ratings, making it
    a fast method for comparing classifiers. Third, it allows model-agnostic comparison,
    making it useful for comparing systems despite implementation differences. We
    validate the metric based on seven recruitment-domain datasets in English and
    German over the course of one year.'

  abstract: Tracking the state of the conversation is a central component in task-oriented
    spoken dialogue systems. One such approach for tracking the dialogue state is
    slot carryover, where a model makes a binary decision if a slot from the context
    is relevant to the current turn. Previous work on the slot carryover task used
    models that made independent decisions for each slot. A close analysis of the
    results show that this approach results in poor performance over longer context
    dialogues. In this paper, we propose to jointly model the slots. We propose two
    neural network architectures, one based on pointer networks that incorporate slot
    ordering information, and the other based on transformer networks that uses self
    attention mechanism to model the slot interdependencies. Our experiments on an
    internal dialogue benchmark dataset and on the public DSTC2 dataset demonstrate
    that our proposed models are able to resolve longer distance slot references and
    are able to achieve competitive performance.

  abstract: "Dialogue systems and conversational agents are becoming increasingly\
    \ popular in modern society. We conceptualized one such conversational agent,\
    \ Microsoft\u2019s \u201CRuuh\u201D with the promise to be able to talk to its\
    \ users on any subject they choose. Building an open-ended conversational agent\
    \ like Ruuh at onset seems like a daunting task, since the agent needs to think\
    \ beyond the utilitarian notion of merely generating \u201Crelevant\u201D responses\
    \ and meet a wider range of user social needs, like expressing happiness when\
    \ user\u2019s favourite sports team wins, sharing a cute comment on showing the\
    \ pictures of the user\u2019s pet and so on. The agent also needs to detect and\
    \ respond to abusive language, sensitive topics and trolling behaviour of the\
    \ users. Many of these problems pose significant research challenges as well as\
    \ product design limitations as one needs to circumnavigate the technical limitations\
    \ to create an acceptable user experience. However, as the product reaches the\
    \ real users the true test begins, and one realizes the challenges and opportunities\
    \ that lie in the vast domain of conversations. With over 2.5 million real-world\
    \ users till date who have generated over 300 million user conversations with\
    \ Ruuh, there is a plethora of learning, insights and opportunities that we will\
    \ talk about in this paper."

  abstract: Providing plausible responses to why questions is a challenging but critical
    goal for language based human-machine interaction. Explanations are challenging
    in that they require many different forms of abstract knowledge and reasoning.
    Previous work has either relied on human-curated structured knowledge bases or
    detailed domain representation to generate satisfactory explanations. They are
    also often limited to ranking pre-existing explanation choices. In our work, we
    contribute to the under-explored area of generating natural language explanations
    for general phenomena. We automatically collect large datasets of explanation-phenomenon
    pairs which allow us to train sequence-to-sequence models to generate natural
    language explanations. We compare different training strategies and evaluate their
    performance using both automatic scores and human ratings. We demonstrate that
    our strategy is sufficient to generate highly plausible explanations for general
    open-domain phenomena compared to other models trained on different datasets.

  abstract: "We propose an adversarial learning approach for generating multi-turn\
    \ dialogue responses. Our proposed framework, hredGAN, is based on conditional\
    \ generative adversarial networks (GANs). The GAN\u2019s generator is a modified\
    \ hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder network (HRED) and the discriminator\
    \ is a word-level bidirectional RNN that shares context and word embeddings with\
    \ the generator. During inference, noise samples conditioned on the dialogue history\
    \ are used to perturb the generator\u2019s latent space to generate several possible\
    \ responses. The final response is the one ranked best by the discriminator. The\
    \ hredGAN shows improved performance over existing methods: (1) it generalizes\
    \ better than networks trained using only the log-likelihood criterion, and (2)\
    \ it generates longer, more informative and more diverse responses with high utterance\
    \ and topic relevance even with limited training data. This performance improvement\
    \ is demonstrated on the Movie triples and Ubuntu dialogue datasets with both\
    \ the automatic and human evaluations."

  abstract: A sequence-to-sequence model tends to generate generic responses with
    little information for input utterances. To solve this problem, we propose a neural
    model that generates relevant and informative responses. Our model has simple
    architecture to enable easy application to existing neural dialogue models. Specifically,
    using positive pointwise mutual information, it first identifies keywords that
    frequently co-occur in responses given an utterance. Then, the model encourages
    the decoder to use the keywords for response generation. Experiment results demonstrate
    that our model successfully diversifies responses relative to previous models.

  abstract: "A neural conversation model is a promising approach to develop dialogue\
    \ systems with the ability of chit-chat. It allows training a model in an end-to-end\
    \ manner without complex rule design nor feature engineering. However, as a side\
    \ effect, the neural model tends to generate safe but uninformative and insensitive\
    \ responses like \u201COK\u201D and \u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D Such replies\
    \ are called generic responses and regarded as a critical problem for user-engagement\
    \ of dialogue systems. For a more engaging chit-chat experience, we propose a\
    \ neural conversation model that generates responsive and self-expressive replies.\
    \ Specifically, our model generates domain-aware and sentiment-rich responses.\
    \ Experiments empirically confirmed that our model outperformed the sequence-to-sequence\
    \ model; 68.1% of our responses were domain-aware with sentiment polarities, which\
    \ was only 2.7% for responses generated by the sequence-to-sequence model."

  abstract: We present our CHARLES-SAARLAND system for the SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared
    Task on Crosslinguality and Context in Morphology, in task 2, Morphological Analysis
    and Lemmatization in Context. We leverage the multilingual BERT model and apply
    several fine-tuning strategies introduced by UDify demonstrating exceptional evaluation
    performance on morpho-syntactic tasks. Our results show that fine-tuning multilingual
    BERT on the concatenation of all available treebanks allows the model to learn
    cross-lingual information that is able to boost lemmatization and morphology tagging
    accuracy over fine-tuning it purely monolingually. Unlike UDify, however, we show
    that when paired with additional character-level and word-level LSTM layers, a
    second stage of fine-tuning on each treebank individually can improve evaluation
    even further. Out of all submissions for this shared task, our system achieves
    the highest average accuracy and f1 score in morphology tagging and places second
    in average lemmatization accuracy.

  abstract: In this paper we describe our system for morphological analysis and lemmatization
    in context, using a transformer-based sequence to sequence model and a biaffine
    attention based BiLSTM model. First, a lemma is produced for a given word, and
    then both the lemma and the given word are used for morphological analysis. We
    also make use of character level word encodings and trainable encodings to improve
    accuracy. Overall, our system ranked fifth in lemmatization and sixth in morphological
    accuracy among twelve systems, and demonstrated considerable improvements over
    the baseline in morphological analysis.

  abstract: In this study, we present Morpheus, a joint contextual lemmatizer and
    morphological tagger. Morpheus is based on a neural sequential architecture where
    inputs are the characters of the surface words in a sentence and the outputs are
    the minimum edit operations between surface words and their lemmata as well as
    the morphological tags assigned to the words. The experiments on the datasets
    in nearly 100 languages provided by SigMorphon 2019 Shared Task 2 organizers show
    that the performance of Morpheus is comparable to the state-of-the-art system
    in terms of lemmatization. In morphological tagging, on the other hand, Morpheus
    significantly outperforms the SigMorphon baseline. In our experiments, we also
    show that the neural encoder-decoder architecture trained to predict the minimum
    edit operations can produce considerably better results than the architecture
    trained to predict the characters in lemmata directly as in previous studies.
    According to the SigMorphon 2019 Shared Task 2 results, Morpheus has placed 3rd
    in lemmatization and reached the 9th place in morphological tagging among all
    participant teams.

    in a sequence, for 107 treebanks. We approach this task with a hierarchical neural
    conditional random field (CRF) model which predicts each coarse-grained feature
    (eg. POS, Case, etc.) independently. However, most treebanks are under-resourced,
    thus making it challenging to train deep neural models for them. Hence, we propose
    a multi-lingual transfer training regime where we transfer from multiple related
    languages that share similar typology.

  abstract: This paper describes two related systems for cross-lingual morphological
    inflection for SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task participation. Both sets of results
    submitted to the shared task for evaluation are obtained using a simple approach
    of predicting transducer actions based on initial alignments on the training set,
    where cross-lingual transfer is limited to only using the high-resource language
    data as additional training set. The performance of the system does not reach
    the performance of the top two systems in the competition. However, we show that
    results can be improved with further tuning. We also present further analyses
    demonstrating that the cross-lingual gain is rather modest.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the UNT HiLT+Ling system for the Sigmorphon 2019
    shared Task 2: Morphological Analysis and Lemmatization in Context. Our core approach
    focuses on the morphological tagging task; part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization
    are treated as secondary tasks. Given the highly multilingual nature of the task,
    we propose an approach which makes minimal use of the supplied training data,
    in order to be extensible to languages without labeled training data for the morphological
    inflection task. Specifically, we use a parallel Bible corpus to align contextual
    embeddings at the verse level. The aligned verses are used to build cross-language
    translation matrices, which in turn are used to map between embedding spaces for
    the various languages. Finally, we use sets of inflected forms, primarily from
    a high-resource language, to induce vector representations for individual UniMorph
    tags. Morphological analysis is performed by matching vector representations to
    embeddings for individual tokens. While our system results are dramatically below
    the average system submitted for the shared task evaluation campaign, our method
    is (we suspect) unique in its minimal reliance on labeled training data.'

  abstract: This paper presents the submission by the Charles University-University
    of Malta team to the SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task on Morphological Analysis and
    Lemmatization in context. We present a lemmatization model based on previous work
    on neural transducers (Makarov and Clematide, 2018b; Aharoni and Goldberg, 2016).
    The key difference is that our model transforms the whole word form in every step,
    instead of consuming it character by character. We propose a merging strategy
    inspired by Byte-Pair-Encoding that reduces the space of valid operations by merging
    frequent adjacent operations. The resulting operations not only encode the actions
    to be performed but the relative position in the word token and how characters
    need to be transformed. Our morphological tagger is a vanilla biLSTM tagger that
    operates over operation representations, encoding operations and words in a hierarchical
    manner. Even though relative performance according to metrics is below the baseline,
    experiments show that our models capture important associations between interpretable
    operation labels and fine-grained morpho-syntax labels.

  abstract: We present de-lexical segmentation, a linguistically motivated alternative
    to greedy or other unsupervised methods, requiring only minimal language specific
    input. Our technique involves creating a small grammar of closed-class affixes
    which can be written in a few hours. The grammar over generates analyses for word
    forms attested in a raw corpus which are disambiguated based on features of the
    linguistic base proposed for each form. Extending the grammar to cover orthographic,
    morpho-syntactic or lexical variation is simple, making it an ideal solution for
    challenging corpora with noisy, dialect-inconsistent, or otherwise non-standard
    content. In two evaluations, we consistently outperform competitive unsupervised
    baselines and approach the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models trained
    on large amounts of data, providing evidence for the value of linguistic input
    during preprocessing.

    \ here that default-to-opposite-side and default-to-same-side stress systems belong\

  abstract: In spontaneous speech, Mandarin tones that belong to the same tone category
    may exhibit many different contour shapes. We explore the use of time-series data
    mining techniques for understanding the variability of tones in a large corpus
    of Mandarin newscast speech. First, we adapt a graph-based approach to characterize
    the clusters (fuzzy types) of tone contour shapes observed in each tone n-gram
    category. Second, we show correlations between these realized contour shape clusters
    and a bag of automatically extracted linguistic features. We discuss the implications
    of the current study within the context of phonological and information theory.

    not been clear what aspects of natural language phonology are learnt by neural
    network inspired distributed representational models such as word2vec. To study
    the kinds of phonological relationships learnt by phone embeddings, we present
    artificial phonology experiments that show that phone embeddings learn paradigmatic
    relationships such as phonemic and allophonic distribution quite well. They are
    also able to capture co-occurrence restrictions among vowels such as those observed
    in languages with vowel harmony. However, they are unable to learn co-occurrence
    restrictions among the class of consonants.

  abstract: "Previous \u201Cwug\u201D tests (Berko, 1958) on Japanese verbal inflection\
    \ have demonstrated that Japanese speakers, both adults and children, cannot inflect\
    \ novel present tense forms to \u201Ccorrect\u201D past tense forms predicted\
    \ by rules of existent verbs (de Chene, 1982; Vance, 1987, 1991; Klafehn, 2003,\
    \ 2013), indicating that Japanese verbs are merely stored in the mental lexicon.\
    \ However, the implicit assumption that present tense forms are bases for verbal\
    \ inflection should not be blindly extended to morphologically rich languages\
    \ like Japanese in which both present and past tense forms are morphologically\
    \ complex without inherent direction (Albright, 2002). Interestingly, there are\
    \ also independent observations in the acquisition literature to suggest that\
    \ past tense forms may be bases for verbal inflection in Japanese (Klafehn, 2003;\
    \ Murasugi et al., 2010; Hirose, 2017; Tatsumi et al., 2018). In this paper, we\
    \ computationally simulate two directions of verbal inflection in Japanese, Present\
    \ \u2192 Past and Past \u2192 Present, with the rule-based computational model\
    \ called Minimal Generalization Learner (MGL; Albright and Hayes, 2003) and experimentally\
    \ evaluate the model with the bidirectional \u201Cwug\u201D test where humans\
    \ inflect novel verbs in two opposite directions. We conclude that Japanese verbs\
    \ can be computed online via some generalizations and those generalizations do\
    \ depend on the direction of morphological inflection."

  abstract: This paper deals with the automatic enhancement of a new German morphological
    database. While there are some databases for flat word segmentation, this is the
    first available resource which can be directly used for deep parsing of German
    words. We combine the entries of this morphological database with the morphological
    tools SMOR and Moremorph and a context-based evaluation method which builds on
    a large Wikipedia corpus. We describe the state of the art and the essential characteristics
    of the database and the context method. The approach is tested on an inflight
    magazine of Lufthansa. We derive over 5,000 new instances of complex words. The
    coverage for the lemma types reaches up to over 99 percent. The precision of new
    found complex splits and monomorphemes is between 0.93 and 0.99.

  abstract: "Polysynthetic languages pose a challenge for morphological analysis due\
    \ to the root-morpheme complexity and to the word class \u201Csquish\u201D. In\
    \ addition, many of these polysynthetic languages are low-resource. We propose\
    \ unsupervised approaches for morphological segmentation of low-resource polysynthetic\
    \ languages based on Adaptor Grammars (AG) (Eskander et al., 2016). We experiment\
    \ with four languages from the Uto-Aztecan family. Our AG-based approaches outperform\
    \ other unsupervised approaches and show promise when compared to supervised methods,\
    \ outperforming them on two of the four languages."

  abstract: Whether phonological transformations in general are subregular is an open
    question. This is the case for most transformations, which have been shown to
    be subsequential, but it is not known whether weakly deterministic mappings form
    a proper subset of the regular functions. This paper demonstrates that there are
    regular functions that are not weakly deterministic, and, because all attested
    processes are weakly deterministic, supports the subregular hypothesis.

  abstract: This paper defines a subregular class of functions called the tier-based
    synchronized strictly local (TSSL) functions. These functions are similar to the
    the tier-based input-output strictly local (TIOSL) functions, except that the
    locality condition is enforced not on the input and output streams, but on the
    computation history of the minimal subsequential finite-state transducer. We show
    that TSSL functions naturally describe rhythmic syncope while TIOSL functions
    cannot, and we argue that TSSL functions provide a more restricted characterization
    of rhythmic syncope than existing treatments within Optimality Theory.

  abstract: "We present Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA) \u2013\
    \ a method for learning nonlinear transformations of arbitrarily many views of\
    \ data, such that the resulting transformations are maximally informative of each\
    \ other. While methods for nonlinear two view representation learning (Deep CCA,\
    \ (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized\
    \ CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep)\
    \ representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information\
    \ from many sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an\
    \ efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn and evaluate\
    \ DGCCA representations for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from\
    \ acoustic & articulatory measurements, recommending hashtags and recommending\
    \ friends on a dataset of Twitter users."

  abstract: While most previous work has focused on different pretraining objectives
    and architectures for transfer learning, we ask how to best adapt the pretrained
    model to a given target task. We focus on the two most common forms of adaptation,
    feature extraction (where the pretrained weights are frozen), and directly fine-tuning
    the pretrained model. Our empirical results across diverse NLP tasks with two
    state-of-the-art models show that the relative performance of fine-tuning vs.
    feature extraction depends on the similarity of the pretraining and target tasks.
    We explore possible explanations for this finding and provide a set of adaptation
    guidelines for the NLP practitioner.

  abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown considerable success,
    especially in the realistic generation of images. In this work, we apply similar
    techniques for the generation of text. We propose a novel approach to handle the
    discrete nature of text, during training, using word embeddings. Our method is
    agnostic to vocabulary size and achieves competitive results relative to methods
    with various discrete gradient estimators.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore a multilingual translation model with a cross-lingually
    shared layer that can be used as fixed-size sentence representation in different
    downstream tasks. We systematically study the impact of the size of the shared
    layer and the effect of including additional languages in the model. In contrast
    to related previous work, we demonstrate that the performance in translation does
    correlate with trainable downstream tasks. In particular, we show that larger
    intermediate layers not only improve translation quality, especially for long
    sentences, but also push the accuracy of trainable classification tasks. On the
    other hand, shorter representations lead to increased compression that is beneficial
    in non-trainable similarity tasks. We hypothesize that the training procedure
    on the downstream task enables the model to identify the encoded information that
    is useful for the specific task whereas non-trainable benchmarks can be confused
    by other types of information also encoded in the representation of a sentence.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose an architecture for machine translation (MT)
    capable of obtaining multilingual sentence representations by incorporating an
    intermediate attention bridge that is shared across all languages. We train the
    model with language-specific encoders and decoders that are connected through
    an inner-attention layer on the encoder side. The attention bridge exploits the
    semantics from each language for translation and develops into a language-agnostic
    meaning representation that can efficiently be used for transfer learning. We
    present a new framework for the efficient development of multilingual neural machine
    translation (NMT) using this model and scheduled training. We have tested the
    approach in a systematic way with a multi-parallel data set. The model achieves
    substantial improvements over strong bilingual models and performs well for zero-shot
    translation, which demonstrates its ability of abstraction and transfer learning.

  abstract: Reduction of the number of parameters is one of the most important goals
    in Deep Learning. In this article we propose an adaptation of Doubly Stochastic
    Variational Inference for Automatic Relevance Determination (DSVI-ARD) for neural
    networks compression. We find this method to be especially useful in language
    modeling tasks, where large number of parameters in the input and output layers
    is often excessive. We also show that DSVI-ARD can be applied together with encoder-decoder
    weight tying allowing to achieve even better sparsity and performance. Our experiments
    demonstrate that more than 90% of the weights in both encoder and decoder layers
    can be removed with a minimal quality loss.

  abstract: Word embeddings have undoubtedly revolutionized NLP. However, pretrained
    embeddings do not always work for a specific task (or set of tasks), particularly
    in limited resource setups. We introduce a simple yet effective, self-supervised
    post-processing method that constructs task-specialized word representations by
    picking from a menu of reconstructing transformations to yield improved end-task
    performance (MORTY). The method is complementary to recent state-of-the-art approaches
    to inductive transfer via fine-tuning, and forgoes costly model architectures
    and annotation. We evaluate MORTY on a broad range of setups, including different
    word embedding methods, corpus sizes and end-task semantics. Finally, we provide
    a surprisingly simple recipe to obtain specialized embeddings that better fit
    end-tasks.

  abstract: Deep learning models continuously break new records across different NLP
    tasks. At the same time, their success exposes weaknesses of model evaluation.
    Here, we compile several key pitfalls of evaluation of sentence embeddings, a
    currently very popular NLP paradigm. These pitfalls include the comparison of
    embeddings of different sizes, normalization of embeddings, and the low (and diverging)
    correlations between transfer and probing tasks. Our motivation is to challenge
    the current evaluation of sentence embeddings and to provide an easy-to-access
    reference for future research. Based on our insights, we also recommend better
    practices for better future evaluations of sentence embeddings.

  abstract: We propose a novel model architecture and training algorithm to learn
    bilingual sentence embeddings from a combination of parallel and monolingual data.
    Our method connects autoencoding and neural machine translation to force the source
    and target sentence embeddings to share the same space without the help of a pivot
    language or an additional transformation. We train a multilayer perceptron on
    top of the sentence embeddings to extract good bilingual sentence pairs from nonparallel
    or noisy parallel data. Our approach shows promising performance on sentence alignment
    recovery and the WMT 2018 parallel corpus filtering tasks with only a single model.

  abstract: "Semantic specialization methods fine-tune distributional word vectors\

    \ for the asymmetric relation of lexical entailment (LE) (i.e., hyponymy-hypernymy\

  abstract: "Vector representations of words have seen an increasing success over\
    \ the past years in a variety of NLP tasks. While there seems to be a consensus\
    \ about the usefulness of word embeddings and how to learn them, it is still unclear\
    \ which representations can capture the meaning of phrases or even whole sentences.\
    \ Recent work has shown that simple operations outperform more complex deep architectures.\
    \ In this work, we propose two novel constraints for computing noun phrase vector\
    \ representations. First, we propose that the semantic and not the syntactic contribution\
    \ of each component of a noun phrase should be considered, so that the resulting\
    \ composed vectors express more of the phrase meaning. Second, the composition\
    \ process of the two phrase vectors should apply suitable dimensions\u2019 selection\
    \ in a way that specific semantic features captured by the phrase\u2019s meaning\
    \ become more salient. Our proposed methods are compared to 11 other approaches,\
    \ including popular baselines and a neural net architecture, and are evaluated\
    \ across 6 tasks and 2 datasets. Our results show that these constraints lead\
    \ to more expressive phrase representations and can be applied to other state-of-the-art\
    \ methods to improve their performance."

  abstract: In this paper we study the influence of using language model pre-training
    for named entity recognition for Historic German. We achieve new state-of-the-art
    results using carefully chosen training data for language models. For a low-resource
    domain like named entity recognition for Historic German, language model pre-training
    can be a strong competitor to CRF-only methods. We show that language model pre-training
    can be more effective than using transfer-learning with labeled datasets. Furthermore,
    we introduce a new language model pre-training objective, synthetic masked language
    model pre-training (SMLM), that allows a transfer from one domain (contemporary
    texts) to another domain (historical texts) by using only the same (character)
    vocabulary. Results show that using SMLM can achieve comparable results for Historic
    named entity recognition, even when they are only trained on contemporary texts.
    Our pre-trained character-based language models improve upon classical CRF-based
    methods and previous work on Bi-LSTMs by boosting F1 score performance by up to
    6%.

  abstract: Knowledge graph embedding models have recently received significant attention
    in the literature. These models learn latent semantic representations for the
    entities and relations in a given knowledge base; the representations can be used
    to infer missing knowledge. In this paper, we study the question of how well recent
    embedding models perform for the task of knowledge base completion, i.e., the
    task of inferring new facts from an incomplete knowledge base. We argue that the
    entity ranking protocol, which is currently used to evaluate knowledge graph embedding
    models, is not suitable to answer this question since only a subset of the model
    predictions are evaluated. We propose an alternative entity-pair ranking protocol
    that considers all model predictions as a whole and is thus more suitable to the
    task. We conducted an experimental study on standard datasets and found that the
    performance of popular embeddings models was unsatisfactory under the new protocol,
    even on datasets that are generally considered to be too easy. Moreover, we found
    that a simple rule-based model often provided superior performance. Our findings
    suggest that there is a need for more research into embedding models as well as
    their training strategies for the task of knowledge base completion.

  abstract: Bilingual word embeddings, which represent lexicons of different languages
    in a shared embedding space, are essential for supporting semantic and knowledge
    transfers in a variety of cross-lingual NLP tasks. Existing approaches to training
    bilingual word embeddings require either large collections of pre-defined seed
    lexicons that are expensive to obtain, or parallel sentences that comprise coarse
    and noisy alignment. In contrast, we propose BiLex that leverages publicly available
    lexical definitions for bilingual word embedding learning. Without the need of
    predefined seed lexicons, BiLex comprises a novel word pairing strategy to automatically
    identify and propagate the precise fine-grain word alignment from lexical definitions.
    We evaluate BiLex in word-level and sentence-level translation tasks, which seek
    to find the cross-lingual counterparts of words and sentences respectively. BiLex
    significantly outperforms previous embedding methods on both tasks.

  abstract: 'Fine-tuning pre-trained language models has significantly advanced the
    state of art in a wide range of NLP downstream tasks. Usually, such language models
    are learned from large and well-formed text corpora from e.g. encyclopedic resources,
    books or news. However, a significant amount of the text to be analyzed nowadays
    is Web data, often from social media. In this paper we consider the research question:
    How do standard pre-trained language models generalize and capture the peculiarities
    of rather short, informal and frequently automatically generated text found in
    social media? To answer this question, we focus on bot detection in Twitter as
    our evaluation task and test the performance of fine-tuning approaches based on
    language models against popular neural architectures such as LSTM and CNN combined
    with pre-trained and contextualized embeddings. Our results also show strong performance
    variations among the different language model approaches, which suggest further
    research.'

    six sentence encoders for each language, each trained by mapping sentence representations

  abstract: In this paper, we propose Multilingual Meta-Embeddings (MME), an effective
    method to learn multilingual representations by leveraging monolingual pre-trained
    embeddings. MME learns to utilize information from these embeddings via a self-attention
    mechanism without explicit language identification. We evaluate the proposed embedding
    method on the code-switching English-Spanish Named Entity Recognition dataset
    in a multilingual and cross-lingual setting. The experimental results show that
    our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multilingual
    setting, and it has the ability to generalize to an unseen language task.

  abstract: 'Short text clustering is a challenging problem when adopting traditional
    bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations, since these lead to sparse vector representations
    of the short texts. Low-dimensional continuous representations or embeddings can
    counter that sparseness problem: their high representational power is exploited
    in deep clustering algorithms. While deep clustering has been studied extensively
    in computer vision, relatively little work has focused on NLP. The method we propose,
    learns discriminative features from both an autoencoder and a sentence embedding,
    then uses assignments from a clustering algorithm as supervision to update weights
    of the encoder network. Experiments on three short text datasets empirically validate
    the effectiveness of our method.'

  abstract: Word-based embedding approaches such as Word2Vec capture the meaning of
    words and relations between them, particularly well when trained with large text
    collections; however, they fail to do so with small datasets. Extensions such
    as fastText reduce the amount of data needed slightly, however, the joint task
    of learning meaningful morphology, syntactic and semantic representations still
    requires a lot of data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to warm-start
    embedding models with morphological information, in order to reduce training time
    and enhance their performance. We use word embeddings generated using both word2vec
    and fastText models and enrich them with morphological information of words, derived
    from kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of word similarity matrices. This
    can be seen as explicitly feeding the network morphological similarities and letting
    it learn semantic and syntactic similarities. Evaluating our models on word similarity
    and analogy tasks in English and German, we find that they not only achieve higher
    accuracies than the original skip-gram and fastText models but also require significantly
    less training data and time. Another benefit of our approach is that it is capable
    of generating a high-quality representation of infrequent words as, for example,
    found in very recent news articles with rapidly changing vocabularies. Lastly,
    we evaluate the different models on a downstream sentence classification task
    in which a CNN model is initialized with our embeddings and find promising results.

  abstract: 'Since their inception, encoder-decoder models have successfully been
    applied to a wide array of problems in computational linguistics. The most recent
    successes are predominantly due to the use of different variations of attention
    mechanisms, but their cognitive plausibility is questionable. In particular, because
    past representations can be revisited at any point in time, attention-centric
    methods seem to lack an incentive to build up incrementally more informative representations
    of incoming sentences. This way of processing stands in stark contrast with the
    way in which humans are believed to process language: continuously and rapidly
    integrating new information as it is encountered. In this work, we propose three
    novel metrics to assess the behavior of RNNs with and without an attention mechanism
    and identify key differences in the way the different model types process sentences.'

  abstract: Adversarial training is a process in Machine Learning that explicitly
    trains models on adversarial inputs (inputs designed to deceive or trick the learning
    process) in order to make it more robust or accurate. In this paper we investigate
    how representing adversarial training models as committees can be used to effectively
    improve the performance of Question-Answer (QA) Ranking. We start by empirically
    probing the effects of adversarial training over multiple QA ranking algorithms,
    including the state-of-the-art Multihop Attention Network model. We evaluate these
    algorithms on several benchmark datasets and observe that, while adversarial training
    is beneficial to most baseline algorithms, there are cases where it may lead to
    overfitting and performance degradation. We investigate the causes of such degradation,
    and then propose a new representation procedure for this adversarial learning
    problem, based on committee learning, that not only is capable of consistently
    improving all baseline algorithms, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
    algorithm by as much as 6% in NDCG.

  abstract: Most existing relation extraction models assume a fixed set of relations
    and are unable to adapt to exploit newly available supervision data to extract
    new relations. In order to alleviate such problems, there is the need to develop
    approaches that make relation extraction models capable of continuous adaptation
    and learning. We investigate and present results for such an approach, based on
    a combination of ideas from lifelong learning and optimization-based meta-learning.
    We evaluate the proposed approach on two recent lifelong relation extraction benchmarks,
    and demonstrate that it markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract: Cross-lingual embeddings aim to represent words in multiple languages
    in a shared vector space by capturing semantic similarities across languages.
    They are a crucial component for scaling tasks to multiple languages by transferring
    knowledge from languages with rich resources to low-resource languages. A common
    approach to learning cross-lingual embeddings is to train monolingual embeddings
    separately for each language and learn a linear projection from the monolingual
    spaces into a shared space, where the mapping relies on a small seed dictionary.
    While there are high-quality generic seed dictionaries and pre-trained cross-lingual
    embeddings available for many language pairs, there is little research on how
    they perform on specialised tasks. In this paper, we investigate the best practices
    for constructing the seed dictionary for a specific domain. We evaluate the embeddings
    on the sequence labelling task of Curriculum Vitae parsing and show that the size
    of a bilingual dictionary, the frequency of the dictionary words in the domain
    corpora and the source of data (task-specific vs generic) influence performance.
    We also show that the less training data is available in the low-resource language,
    the more the construction of the bilingual dictionary matters, and demonstrate
    that some of the choices are crucial in the zero-shot transfer learning case.

  abstract: Pre-trained word embeddings are used in several downstream applications
    as well as for constructing representations for sentences, paragraphs and documents.
    Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the pretrained word vectors
    through post-processing algorithms. One improvement area is reducing the dimensionality
    of word embeddings. Reducing the size of word embeddings can improve their utility
    in memory constrained devices, benefiting several real world applications. In
    this work, we present a novel technique that efficiently combines PCA based dimensionality
    reduction with a recently proposed post-processing algorithm (Mu and Viswanath,
    2018), to construct effective word embeddings of lower dimensions. Empirical evaluations
    on several benchmarks show that our algorithm efficiently reduces the embedding
    size while achieving similar or (more often) better performance than original
    embeddings. We have released the source code along with this paper.

  abstract: The scarcity of labeled training data across many languages is a significant
    roadblock for multilingual neural language processing. We approach the lack of
    in-language training data using sentence embeddings that map text written in different
    languages, but with similar meanings, to nearby embedding space representations.
    The representations are produced using a dual-encoder based model trained to maximize
    the representational similarity between sentence pairs drawn from parallel data.
    The representations are enhanced using multitask training and unsupervised monolingual
    corpora. The effectiveness of our multilingual sentence embeddings are assessed
    on a comprehensive collection of monolingual, cross-lingual, and zero-shot/few-shot
    learning tasks.

  abstract: We propose a novel method, Modality-based Redundancy Reduction Fusion
    (MRRF), for understanding and modulating the relative contribution of each modality
    in multimodal inference tasks. This is achieved by obtaining an (M+1)-way tensor
    to consider the high-order relationships between M modalities and the output layer
    of a neural network model. Applying a modality-based tensor factorization method,
    which adopts different factors for different modalities, results in removing information
    present in a modality that can be compensated by other modalities, with respect
    to model outputs. This helps to understand the relative utility of information
    in each modality. In addition it leads to a less complicated model with less parameters
    and therefore could be applied as a regularizer avoiding overfitting. We have
    applied this method to three different multimodal datasets in sentiment analysis,
    personality trait recognition, and emotion recognition. We are able to recognize
    relationships and relative importance of different modalities in these tasks and
    achieves a 1% to 4% improvement on several evaluation measures compared to the
    state-of-the-art for all three tasks.

  abstract: "While the application of word embedding models to downstream Natural\

    \ paper, we present the results of our experiments on learning a simple multi-task\
    \ neural network model for part-of-speech and semantic tagging for Welsh using\
    \ a pre-trained embedding model from FastText. Our model\u2019s performance was\

  abstract: "The issues of algorithmic fairness and bias have recently featured prominently\
    \ in many publications highlighting the fact that training the algorithms for\
    \ maximum performance may often result in predictions that are biased against\
    \ various groups. Educational applications based on NLP and speech processing\
    \ technologies often combine multiple complex machine learning algorithms and\
    \ are thus vulnerable to the same sources of bias as other machine learning systems.\
    \ Yet such systems can have high impact on people\u2019s lives especially when\
    \ deployed as part of high-stakes tests. In this paper we discuss different definitions\
    \ of fairness and possible ways to apply them to educational applications. We\
    \ then use simulated and real data to consider how test-takers\u2019 native language\
    \ backgrounds can affect their automated scores on an English language proficiency\
    \ assessment. We illustrate that total fairness may not be achievable and that\
    \ different definitions of fairness may require different solutions."

  abstract: Predicting the construct-relevant difficulty of Multiple-Choice Questions
    (MCQs) has the potential to reduce cost while maintaining the quality of high-stakes
    exams. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the difficulty of MCQs
    from a high-stakes medical exam, where all questions were deliberately written
    to a common reading level. To accomplish this, we extract a large number of linguistic
    features and embedding types, as well as features quantifying the difficulty of
    the items for an automatic question-answering system. The results show that the
    proposed approach outperforms various baselines with a statistically significant
    difference. Best results were achieved when using the full feature set, where
    embeddings had the highest predictive power, followed by linguistic features.
    An ablation study of the various types of linguistic features suggested that information
    from all levels of linguistic processing contributes to predicting item difficulty,
    with features related to semantic ambiguity and the psycholinguistic properties
    of words having a slightly higher importance. Owing to its generic nature, the
    presented approach has the potential to generalize over other exams containing
    MCQs.

  abstract: "Vocabulary is one of the most important parts of language competence.\
    \ Testing of vocabulary knowledge is central to research on reading and language.\
    \ However, it usually costs a large amount of time and human labor to build an\
    \ item bank and to test large number of students. In this paper, we propose a\
    \ novel testing strategy by combining automatic item generation (AIG) and computerized\
    \ adaptive testing (CAT) in vocabulary assessment for Chinese L2 learners. Firstly,\
    \ we generate three types of vocabulary questions by modeling both the vocabulary\
    \ knowledge and learners\u2019 writing error data. After evaluation and calibration,\
    \ we construct a balanced item pool with automatically generated items, and implement\
    \ a three-parameter computerized adaptive test. We conduct manual item evaluation\
    \ and online student tests in the experiments. The results show that the combination\
    \ of AIG and CAT can construct test items efficiently and reduce test cost significantly.\
    \ Also, the test result of CAT can provide valuable feedback to AIG algorithms."

  abstract: Computational linguistic research on the language complexity of student
    writing typically involves human ratings as a gold standard. However, educational
    science shows that teachers find it difficult to identify and cleanly separate
    accuracy, different aspects of complexity, contents, and structure. In this paper,
    we therefore explore the use of computational linguistic methods to investigate
    how task-appropriate complexity and accuracy relate to the grading of overall
    performance, content performance, and language performance as assigned by teachers.
    Based on texts written by students for the official school-leaving state examination
    (Abitur), we show that teachers successfully assign higher language performance
    grades to essays with higher task-appropriate language complexity and properly
    separate this from content scores. Yet, accuracy impacts teacher assessment for
    all grading rubrics, also the content score, overemphasizing the role of accuracy.
    Our analysis is based on broad computational linguistic modeling of German language
    complexity and an innovative theory- and data-driven feature aggregation method
    inferring task-appropriate language complexity.

  abstract: We present a model for automatic scoring of coherence based on comparing
    the rhetorical structure (RS) of college student summaries in L2 (English) against
    expert summaries. Coherence is conceptualised as a construct consisting of the
    rhetorical relation and its arguments. Comparison with expert-assigned scores
    shows that RS scores correlate with both cohesion and coherence. Furthermore,
    RS scores improve the accuracy of a regression model for cohesion score prediction.

  abstract: This paper reports on the BEA-2019 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction
    (GEC). As with the CoNLL-2014 shared task, participants are required to correct
    all types of errors in test data. One of the main contributions of the BEA-2019
    shared task is the introduction of a new dataset, the Write&Improve+LOCNESS corpus,
    which represents a wider range of native and learner English levels and abilities.
    Another contribution is the introduction of tracks, which control the amount of
    annotated data available to participants. Systems are evaluated in terms of ERRANT
    F_0.5, which allows us to report a much wider range of performance statistics.
    The competition was hosted on Codalab and remains open for further submissions
    on the blind test set.

  abstract: 'Spelling correction has attracted a lot of attention in the NLP community.
    However, models have been usually evaluated on artificiallycreated or proprietary
    corpora. A publiclyavailable corpus of authentic misspellings, annotated in context,
    is still lacking. To address this, we present and release an annotated data set
    of 6,121 spelling errors in context, based on a corpus of essays written by English
    language learners. We also develop a minimallysupervised context-aware approach
    to spelling correction. It achieves strong results on our data: 88.12% accuracy.
    This approach can also train with a minimal amount of annotated data (performance
    reduced by less than 1%). Furthermore, this approach allows easy portability to
    new domains. We evaluate our model on data from a medical domain and demonstrate
    that it rivals the performance of a model trained and tuned on in-domain data.'

  abstract: The quantity and quality of training data plays a crucial role in grammatical
    error correction (GEC). However, due to the fact that obtaining human-annotated
    GEC data is both time-consuming and expensive, several studies have focused on
    generating artificial error sentences to boost training data for grammatical error
    correction, and shown significantly better performance. The present study explores
    how fluency filtering can affect the quality of artificial errors. By comparing
    artificial data filtered by different levels of fluency, we find that artificial
    error sentences with low fluency can greatly facilitate error correction, while
    high fluency errors introduce more noise.

    or classification, (ii) the use of various non-neural and neural machine learning
    architectures with various types of input representations, and (iii) applying
    multi-task learning for joint prediction of essay scoring and native language
    identification. We find that a GRU-based attention model trained in a single-task
    setting performs best at the AES task.

  abstract: Grammatical error detection (GED) in non-native writing requires systems
    to identify a wide range of errors in text written by language learners. Error
    detection as a purely supervised task can be challenging, as GED datasets are
    limited in size and the label distributions are highly imbalanced. Contextualized
    word representations offer a possible solution, as they can efficiently capture
    compositional information in language and can be optimized on large amounts of
    unsupervised data. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison of ELMo,
    BERT and Flair embeddings (Peters et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Akbik et
    al., 2018) on a range of public GED datasets, and propose an approach to effectively
    integrate such representations in current methods, achieving a new state of the
    art on GED. We further analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different contextual
    embeddings for the task at hand, and present detailed analyses of their impact
    on different types of errors.

  abstract: Character-based representations in neural models have been claimed to
    be a tool to overcome spelling variation in in word token-based input. We examine
    this claim in neural models for content scoring. We formulate precise hypotheses
    about the possible effects of adding character representations to word-based models
    and test these hypotheses on large-scale real world content scoring datasets.
    We find that, while character representations may provide small performance gains
    in general, their effectiveness in accounting for spelling variation may be limited.
    We show that spelling correction can provide larger gains than character representations,
    and that spelling correction improves the performance of models with character
    representations. With these insights, we report a new state of the art on the
    ASAP-SAS content scoring dataset.

  abstract: Recent work on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has highlighted the
    importance of language modeling in that it is certainly possible to achieve good
    performance by comparing the probabilities of the proposed edits. At the same
    time, advancements in language modeling have managed to generate linguistic output,
    which is almost indistinguishable from that of human-generated text. In this paper,
    we up the ante by exploring the potential of more sophisticated language models
    in GEC and offer some key insights on their strengths and weaknesses. We show
    that, in line with recent results in other NLP tasks, Transformer architectures
    achieve consistently high performance and provide a competitive baseline for future
    machine learning models.

  abstract: 'The field of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has produced various
    systems to deal with focused phenomena or general text editing. We propose an
    automatic way to combine black-box systems. Our method automatically detects the
    strength of a system or the combination of several systems per error type, improving
    precision and recall while optimizing F-score directly. We show consistent improvement
    over the best standalone system in all the configurations tested. This approach
    also outperforms average ensembling of different RNN models with random initializations.
    In addition, we analyze the use of BERT for GEC - reporting promising results
    on this end. We also present a spellchecker created for this task which outperforms
    standard spellcheckers tested on the task of spellchecking. This paper describes
    a system submission to Building Educational Applications 2019 Shared Task: Grammatical
    Error Correction. Combining the output of top BEA 2019 shared task systems using
    our approach, currently holds the highest reported score in the open phase of
    the BEA 2019 shared task, improving F-0.5 score by 3.7 points over the best result
    reported.'

    the system performance. The previous state-of-the-art neural GEC system is an
    ensemble of four Transformer models pretrained on a large amount of Wikipedia

    a sophisticated erroneous data generating component. Our system achieved an F0:5
    of 66.61 in the BEA 2019 Shared Task: Grammatical Error Correction. With our novel

  abstract: In this paper, we describe two systems we developed for the three tracks
    we have participated in the BEA-2019 GEC Shared Task. We investigate competitive
    classification models with bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN) and
    neural machine translation (NMT) models. For different tracks, we use ensemble
    systems to selectively combine the NMT models, the classification models, and
    some rules, and demonstrate that an ensemble solution can effectively improve
    GEC performance over single systems. Our GEC systems ranked the first in the Unrestricted
    Track, and the third in both the Restricted Track and the Low Resource Track.

    Applications (BEA) 2019 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). The
    task is to detect and correct grammatical errors that occurred in essays. We participate
    in 2 tracks including the Restricted Track and the Unrestricted Track. Our system
    is based on a Transformer model architecture. We integrate many effective methods
    proposed in recent years. Such as, Byte Pair Encoding, model ensemble, checkpoints
    average and spell checker. We also corrupt the public monolingual data to further
    improve the performance of the model. On the test data of the BEA 2019 Shared
    Task, our system yields F0.5 = 58.62 and 59.50, ranking twelfth and fourth respectively.

  abstract: Grammatical error correction can be viewed as a low-resource sequence-to-sequence
    task, because publicly available parallel corpora are limited.To tackle this challenge,
    we first generate erroneous versions of large unannotated corpora using a realistic
    noising function. The resulting parallel corpora are sub-sequently used to pre-train
    Transformer models. Then, by sequentially applying transfer learning, we adapt
    these models to the domain and style of the test set. Combined with a context-aware
    neural spellchecker, our system achieves competitive results in both restricted
    and low resource tracks in ACL 2019 BEAShared Task. We release all of our code
    and materials for reproducibility.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe our submission to the BEA 2019 shared task
    on grammatical error correction. We present a system pipeline that utilises both
    error detection and correction models. The input text is first corrected by two
    complementary neural machine translation systems: one using convolutional networks
    and multi-task learning, and another using a neural Transformer-based system.
    Training is performed on publicly available data, along with artificial examples
    generated through back-translation. The n-best lists of these two machine translation
    systems are then combined and scored using a finite state transducer (FST). Finally,
    an unsupervised re-ranking system is applied to the n-best output of the FST.
    The re-ranker uses a number of error detection features to re-rank the FST n-best
    list and identify the final 1-best correction hypothesis. Our system achieves
    66.75% F 0.5 on error correction (ranking 4th), and 82.52% F 0.5 on token-level
    error detection (ranking 2nd) in the restricted track of the shared task.'

  abstract: In this paper, we explore two approaches of generating error-focused phrases
    and examine whether these phrases can lead to better performance in grammatical
    error correction for the restricted track of BEA 2019 Shared Task on GEC. Our
    results show that phrases directly extracted from GEC corpora outperform phrases
    from statistical machine translation phrase table by a large margin. Appending
    error+context phrases to the original GEC corpora yields comparably high precision.
    We also explore the generation of artificial syntactic error sentences using error+context
    phrases for the unrestricted track. The additional training data greatly facilitates
    syntactic error correction (e.g., verb form) and contributes to better overall
    performance.

  abstract: A number of methods have been proposed to automatically extract collocations,
    i.e., conventionalized lexical combinations, from text corpora. However, the attempts
    to evaluate and compare them with a specific application in mind lag behind. This
    paper compares three end-to-end resources for collocation learning, all of which
    used the same corpus but different methods. Adopting a gold-standard evaluation
    method, the results show that the method of dependency parsing outperforms regex-over-pos
    in collocation identification. The lexical association measures (AMs) used for
    collocation ranking perform about the same overall but differently for individual
    collocation types. Further analysis has also revealed that there are considerable
    differences between other commonly used AMs.

  abstract: "In this paper, we present experiments that estimate the impact of specific\
    \ lexical choices of people writing in a second language (L2). In particular,\
    \ we look at misspelled words that indicate lexical uncertainty on the part of\
    \ the author, and separate them into three categories: misspelled cognates, \u201C\
    L2-ed\u201D (in our case, anglicized) words, and all other spelling errors. We\
    \ test the assumption that such errors contain clues about the native language\
    \ of an essay\u2019s author through the task of native language identification.\
    \ The results of the experiments show that the information brought by each of\
    \ these categories is complementary. We also note that while the distribution\
    \ of such features changes with the proficiency level of the writer, their contribution\
    \ towards native language identification remains significant at all levels."

    training strategy to study the impact of the training set size on the classifier
    performances. The paper also introduces ITA-PREREQ, to the best of our knowledge
    the first Italian dataset annotated with prerequisite relations between pairs
    of educational concepts, and describe the automatic strategy devised to build

  abstract: "Visual content has been proven to be effective for micro-learning compared\
    \ to other media. In this paper, we discuss leveraging this observation in our\
    \ efforts to build audio-visual content for young learners\u2019 vocabulary learning.\
    \ We attempt to tackle two major issues in the process of traditional visual curation\
    \ tasks. Generic learning videos do not necessarily satisfy the unique context\
    \ of a learner and/or an educator, and hence may not result in maximal learning\
    \ outcomes. Also, manual video curation by educators is a highly labor-intensive\
    \ process. To this end, we present a customizable micro-learning audio-visual\
    \ content curation tool that is designed to reduce the human (educator) effort\
    \ in creating just-in-time learning videos from a textual description (learning\
    \ script). This provides educators with control of the content while preparing\
    \ the learning scripts, and in turn can also be customized to capture the desired\
    \ learning objectives and outcomes. As a use case, we automatically generate learning\
    \ videos with British National Corpus\u2019 (BNC) frequently spoken vocabulary\
    \ words and evaluate them with experts. They positively recommended the generated\
    \ learning videos with an average rating of 4.25 on a Likert scale of 5 points.\
    \ The inter-annotator agreement between the experts for the video quality was\
    \ substantial (Fleiss Kappa=0.62) with an overall agreement of 81%."

  abstract: "During learning, students often have questions which they would benefit\
    \ from responses to in real time. In class, a student can ask a question to a\
    \ teacher. During homework, or even in class if the student is shy, it can be\
    \ more difficult to receive a rapid response. In this work, we introduce Curio\
    \ SmartChat, an automated question answering system for middle school Science\
    \ topics. Our system has now been used by around 20,000 students who have so far\
    \ asked over 100,000 questions. We present data on the challenge created by students\u2019\
    \ grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, and discuss our system\u2019s approach\
    \ and degree of effectiveness at disambiguating questions that the system is initially\
    \ unsure about. We also discuss the prevalence of student \u201Csmall talk\u201D\
    \ not related to science topics, the pluses and minuses of this behavior, and\
    \ how a system should respond to these conversational acts. We conclude with discussions\
    \ and point to directions for potential future work."

  abstract: "This paper discusses the computer-assisted content evaluation of summaries.\
    \ We propose a method to make a correspondence between the segments of the source\
    \ text and its summary. As a unit of the segment, we adopt \u201CIdea Unit (IU)\u201D\
    \ which is proposed in Applied Linguistics. Introducing IUs enables us to make\
    \ a correspondence even for the sentences that contain multiple ideas. The IU\
    \ correspondence is made based on the similarity between vector representations\
    \ of IU. An evaluation experiment with two source texts and 20 summaries showed\
    \ that the proposed method is more robust against rephrased expressions than the\
    \ conventional ROUGE-based baselines. Also, the proposed method outperformed the\
    \ baselines in recall. We im-plemented the proposed method in a GUI tool\u201C\
    Segment Matcher\u201D that aids teachers to estab-lish a link between corresponding\
    \ IUs acrossthe summary and source text."

  abstract: "Automatic readability assessment aims to ensure that readers read texts\
    \ that they can comprehend. However, computational models are typically trained\
    \ on texts created from the perspective of the text writer, not the target reader.\
    \ There is little experimental research on the relationship between expert annotations\
    \ of readability, reader\u2019s language proficiency, and different levels of\
    \ reading comprehension. To address this gap, we conducted a user study in which\
    \ over a 100 participants read texts of different reading levels and answered\
    \ questions created to test three forms of comprehension. Our results indicate\
    \ that more than readability annotation or reader proficiency, it is the type\
    \ of comprehension question asked that shows differences between reader responses\
    \ - inferential questions were difficult for users of all levels of proficiency\
    \ across reading levels. The data collected from this study will be released with\
    \ this paper, which will, for the first time, provide a collection of 45 reader\
    \ bench marked texts to evaluate readability assessment systems developed for\
    \ adult learners of English. It can also potentially be useful for the development\
    \ of question generation approaches in intelligent tutoring systems research."

  abstract: "The selection of texts for second language learning purposes typically\
    \ relies on teachers\u2019 and test developers\u2019 individual judgment of the\
    \ observable qualitative properties of a text. Little or no consideration is generally\

    \ This study aims to fill the gap by evaluating the effectiveness of an automatic\
    \ tool trained to assess text complexity in the context of Italian as a second\
    \ language learning. A dataset of texts labeled by expert test developers was\
    \ used to evaluate the performance of three classifier models (decision tree,\
    \ random forest, and support vector machine), which were trained using linguistic\
    \ features measured quantitatively and extracted from the texts. The experimental\

  abstract: "We present a machine foreign-language teacher that takes documents written\
    \ in a student\u2019s native language and detects situations where it can replace\
    \ words with their foreign glosses such that new foreign vocabulary can be learned\
    \ simply through reading the resulting mixed-language text. We show that it is\
    \ possible to design such a machine teacher without any supervised data from (human)\
    \ students. We accomplish this by modifying a cloze language model to incrementally\
    \ learn new vocabulary items, and use this language model as a proxy for the word\
    \ guessing and learning ability of real students. Our machine foreign-language\
    \ teacher decides which subset of words to replace by consulting this language\
    \ model. We evaluate three variants of our student proxy language models through\
    \ a study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We find that MTurk \u201Cstudents\u201D\
    \ were able to guess the meanings of foreign words introduced by the machine teacher\
    \ with high accuracy for both function words as well as content words in two out\
    \ of the three models. In addition, we show that students are able to retain their\
    \ knowledge about the foreign words after they finish reading the document."

    \ proficiency are expected to assess a wide range of performance categories, and\
    \ the content is one of the core performance categories. In order to assess the\

  abstract: A typical medical curriculum is organized in a hierarchy of instructional
    objectives called Learning Outcomes (LOs); a few thousand LOs span five years
    of study. Gaining a thorough understanding of the curriculum requires learners
    to recognize and apply related LOs across years, and across different parts of
    the curriculum. However, given the large scope of the curriculum, manually labeling
    related LOs is tedious, and almost impossible to scale. In this paper, we build
    a system that learns relationships between LOs, and we achieve up to human-level
    performance in the LO relationship extraction task. We then present an application
    where the proposed system is employed to build a map of related LOs and Learning
    Resources (LRs) pertaining to a virtual patient case. We believe that our system
    can help medical students grasp the curriculum better, within classroom as well
    as in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) settings.

  abstract: This article studies the relationship between text readability indice
    and automatic machine understanding systems. Our hypothesis is that the simpler
    a text is, the better it should be understood by a machine. We thus expect to
    a strong correlation between readability levels on the one hand, and performance
    of automatic reading systems on the other hand. We test this hypothesis with several
    understanding systems based on language models of varying strengths, measuring
    this correlation on two corpora of journalistic texts. Our results suggest that
    this correlation is rather small that existing comprehension systems are far to
    reproduce the gradual improvement of their performance on texts of decreasing
    complexity.

  abstract: We present an analysis of metaphors in news text simplification. Using
    features that capture general and metaphor specific characteristics, we test whether
    we can automatically identify which metaphors will be changed or preserved, and
    whether there are features that have different predictive power for metaphors
    or literal words. The experiments show that the Age of Acquisition is the most
    distinctive feature for both metaphors and literal words. Features that capture
    Imageability and Concreteness are useful when used alone, but within the full
    set of features they lose their impact. Frequency of use seems to be the best
    feature to differentiate metaphors that should be changed and those to be preserved.

  abstract: 'This study aims to build an automatic system for the detection of plagiarized
    spoken responses in the context of an assessment of English speaking proficiency
    for non-native speakers. Classification models were trained to distinguish between
    plagiarized and non-plagiarized responses with two different types of features:
    text-to-text content similarity measures, which are commonly used in the task
    of plagiarism detection for written documents, and speaking proficiency measures,
    which were specifically designed for spontaneous speech and extracted using an
    automated speech scoring system. The experiments were first conducted on a large
    data set drawn from an operational English proficiency assessment across multiple
    years, and the best classifier on this heavily imbalanced data set resulted in
    an F1-score of 0.761 on the plagiarized class. This system was then validated
    on operational responses collected from a single administration of the assessment
    and achieved a recall of 0.897. The results indicate that the proposed system
    can potentially be used to improve the validity of both human and automated assessment
    of non-native spoken English.'

  abstract: There is a long record of research on equity in schools. As machine learning
    researchers begin to study fairness and bias in earnest, language technologies
    in education have an unusually strong theoretical and applied foundation to build
    on. Here, we introduce concepts from culturally relevant pedagogy and other frameworks
    for teaching and learning, identifying future work on equity in NLP. We present
    case studies in a range of topics like intelligent tutoring systems, computer-assisted
    language learning, automated essay scoring, and sentiment analysis in classrooms,
    and provide an actionable agenda for research.

  abstract: 'Knowing how to use words appropriately has been a key to improving language
    proficiency. Previous studies typically discuss how students learn receptively
    to select the correct candidate from a set of confusing words in the fill-in-the-blank
    task where specific context is given. In this paper, we go one step further, assisting
    students to learn to use confusing words appropriately in a productive task: sentence
    translation. We leverage the GiveMe-Example system, which suggests example sentences
    for each confusing word, to achieve this goal. In this study, students learn to
    differentiate the confusing words by reading the example sentences, and then choose
    the appropriate word(s) to complete the sentence translation task. Results show
    students made substantial progress in terms of sentence structure. In addition,
    highly proficient students better managed to learn confusing words. In view of
    the influence of the first language on learners, we further propose an effective
    approach to improve the quality of the suggested sentences.'

  abstract: 'One of the challenges of building natural language processing (NLP) applications
    for education is finding a large domain-specific corpus for the subject of interest
    (e.g., history or science). To address this challenge, we propose a tool, Dexter,
    that extracts a subject-specific corpus from a heterogeneous corpus, such as Wikipedia,
    by relying on a small seed corpus and distributed document representations. We
    empirically show the impact of the generated corpus on language modeling, estimating
    word embeddings, and consequently, distractor generation, resulting in better
    performances than while using a general domain corpus, a heuristically constructed
    domain-specific corpus, and a corpus generated by a popular system: BootCaT.'

  abstract: Automated essay scoring systems typically rely on hand-crafted features
    to predict essay quality, but such systems are limited by the cost of feature
    engineering. Neural networks offer an alternative to feature engineering, but
    they typically require more annotated data. This paper explores network structures,
    contextualized embeddings and pre-training strategies aimed at capturing discourse
    characteristics of essays. Experiments on three essay scoring tasks show benefits
    from all three strategies in different combinations, with simpler architectures
    being more effective when less training data is available.

  abstract: Automatic assessment of the proficiency levels of the learner is a critical
    part of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. We present methods for assessment in the
    context of language learning. We use a specialized Elo formula used in conjunction
    with educational data mining. We simultaneously obtain ratings for the proficiency
    of the learners and for the difficulty of the linguistic concepts that the learners
    are trying to master. From the same data we also learn a graph structure representing
    a domain model capturing the relations among the concepts. This application of
    Elo provides ratings for learners and concepts which correlate well with subjective
    proficiency levels of the learners and difficulty levels of the concepts.

  abstract: "The segmentation of argumentative units is an important subtask of argument\
    \ mining, which is frequently addressed at a coarse granularity, usually assuming\
    \ argumentative units to be no smaller than sentences. Approaches focusing at\
    \ the clause-level granularity, typically address the task as sequence labeling\
    \ at the token level, aiming to classify whether a token begins, is inside, or\
    \ is outside of an argumentative unit. Most approaches exploit highly engineered,\
    \ manually constructed features, and algorithms typically used in sequential tagging\
    \ \u2013 such as Conditional Random Fields, while more recent approaches try to\
    \ exploit manually constructed features in the context of deep neural networks.\
    \ In this context, we examined to what extend recent advances in sequential labelling\
    \ allow to reduce the need for highly sophisticated, manually constructed features,\
    \ and whether limiting features to embeddings, pre-trained on large corpora is\
    \ a promising approach. Evaluation results suggest the examined models and approaches\
    \ can exhibit comparable performance, minimising the need for feature engineering."

  abstract: 'We present a model to tackle a fundamental but understudied problem in
    computational argumentation: proposition extraction. Propositions are the basic
    units of an argument and the primary building blocks of most argument mining systems.
    However, they are usually substituted by argumentative discourse units obtained
    via surface-level text segmentation, which may yield text segments that lack semantic
    information necessary for subsequent argument mining processes. In contrast, our
    cascade model aims to extract complete propositions by handling anaphora resolution,
    text segmentation, reported speech, questions, imperatives, missing subjects,
    and revision. We formulate each task as a computational problem and test various
    models using a corpus of the 2016 U.S. presidential debates. We show promising
    performance for some tasks and discuss main challenges in proposition extraction.'

  abstract: "When assessing relations between argumentative units (e.g., support or\
    \ attack), computational systems often exploit disclosing indicators or markers\
    \ that are not part of elementary argumentative units (EAUs) themselves, but are\
    \ gained from their context (position in paragraph, preceding tokens, etc.). We\
    \ show that this dependency is much stronger than previously assumed. In fact,\
    \ we show that by completely masking the EAU text spans and only feeding information\
    \ from their context, a competitive system may function even better. We argue\
    \ that an argument analysis system that relies more on discourse context than\
    \ the argument\u2019s content is unsafe, since it can easily be tricked. To alleviate\
    \ this issue, we separate argumentative units from their context such that the\
    \ system is forced to model and rely on an EAU\u2019s content. We show that the\
    \ resulting classification system is more robust, and argue that such models are\
    \ better suited for predicting argumentative relations across documents."

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate similarities between discourse and argumentation
    structures by aligning subtrees in a corpus containing both annotations. Contrary
    to previous works, we focus on comparing sub-structures and not only relations
    matches. Using data mining techniques, we show that discourse and argumentation
    most often align well, and the double annotation allows to derive a mapping between
    structures. Moreover, this approach enables the study of similarities between
    discourse structures and differences in their expressive power.

  abstract: In this work we propose to leverage resources available with discourse-level
    annotations to facilitate the identification of argumentative components and relations
    in scientific texts, which has been recognized as a particularly challenging task.
    In particular, we implement and evaluate a transfer learning approach in which
    contextualized representations learned from discourse parsing tasks are used as
    input of argument mining models. As a pilot application, we explore the feasibility
    of using automatically identified argumentative components and relations to predict
    the acceptance of papers in computer science venues. In order to conduct our experiments,
    we propose an annotation scheme for argumentative units and relations and use
    it to enrich an existing corpus with an argumentation layer.

  abstract: As part of a larger project on argument mining of Swedish parliamentary
    data, we have created a semantic graph that, together with named entity recognition
    and resolution (NER), should make it easier to establish connections between arguments
    in a given debate. The graph is essentially a semantic database that keeps track
    of Members of Parliament (MPs), in particular their presence in the parliament
    and activity in debates, but also party affiliation and participation in commissions.
    The hope is that the Swedish PoliGraph will enable us to perform named entity
    resolution on debates in the Swedish parliament with a high accuracy, with the
    aim of determining to whom an argument is directed.

  abstract: Engaging in a live debate requires, among other things, the ability to
    effectively rebut arguments claimed by your opponent. In particular, this requires
    identifying these arguments. Here, we suggest doing so by automatically mining
    claims from a corpus of news articles containing billions of sentences, and searching
    for them in a given speech. This raises the question of whether such claims indeed
    correspond to those made in spoken speeches. To this end, we collected a large
    dataset of 400 speeches in English discussing 200 controversial topics, mined
    claims for each topic, and asked annotators to identify the mined claims mentioned
    in each speech. Results show that in the vast majority of speeches debaters indeed
    make use of such claims. In addition, we present several baselines for the automatic
    detection of mined claims in speeches, forming the basis for future work. All
    collected data is freely available for research.

  abstract: Identification of argumentative components is an important stage of argument
    mining. Lexicon information is reported as one of the most frequently used features
    in the argument mining research. In this paper, we propose a methodology to integrate
    lexicon information into a neural network model by attention mechanism. We conduct
    experiments on the UKP dataset, which is collected from heterogeneous sources
    and contains several text types, e.g., microblog, Wikipedia, and news. We explore
    lexicons from various application scenarios such as sentiment analysis and emotion
    detection. We also compare the experimental results of leveraging different lexicons.

  abstract: Attention mechanisms have seen some success for natural language processing
    downstream tasks in recent years and generated new state-of-the-art results. A
    thorough evaluation of the attention mechanism for the task of Argumentation Mining
    is missing. With this paper, we report a comparative evaluation of attention layers
    in combination with a bidirectional long short-term memory network, which is the
    current state-of-the-art approach for the unit segmentation task. We also compare
    sentence-level contextualized word embeddings to pre-generated ones. Our findings
    suggest that for this task, the additional attention layer does not improve the
    performance. In most cases, contextualized embeddings do also not show an improvement
    on the score achieved by pre-defined embeddings.

  abstract: In recent years, argumentation mining, which automatically extracts the
    structure of argumentation from unstructured documents such as essays and debates,
    is gaining attention. For argumentation mining applications, argument-component
    classification is an important subtask. The existing methods can be classified
    into supervised methods and unsupervised methods. Supervised document classification
    performs classification using a single sentence without relying on the whole document.
    On the other hand, unsupervised document classification has the advantage of being
    able to use the whole document, but accuracy of these methods is not so high.
    In this paper, we propose a method for argument-component classification that
    combines relation identification by neural networks and TextRank to integrate
    relation informations (i.e. the strength of the relation). This method can use
    argumentation-specific knowledge by employing a supervised learning on a corpus
    while maintaining the advantage of using the whole document. Experiments on two
    corpora, one consisting of student essay and the other of Wikipedia articles,
    show the effectiveness of this method.

  abstract: The purpose of this study is to deploy a novel methodology for classifying
    different argumentative support (supporting evidences) in arguments, without considering
    the context. The proposed methodology is based on the idea that the use of Tree
    Kernel algorithms can be a good way to discriminate between different types of
    argumentative stances without the need of highly engineered features. This can
    be useful in different Argumentation Mining sub-tasks. This work provides an example
    of classifier built using a Tree Kernel method, which can discriminate between
    different kinds of argumentative support with a high accuracy. The ability to
    distinguish different kinds of support is, in fact, a key step toward Argument
    Scheme classification.

  abstract: "Research on argumentation mining from text has frequently discussed relationships\
    \ to discourse parsing, but few empirical results are available so far. One corpus\
    \ that has been annotated in parallel for argumentation structure and for discourse\
    \ structure (RST, SDRT) are the \u2018argumentative microtexts\u2019 (Peldszus\
    \ and Stede, 2016a). While results on perusing the gold RST annotations for predicting\
    \ argumentation have been published (Peldszus and Stede, 2016b), the step to automatic\
    \ discourse parsing has not yet been taken. In this paper, we run various discourse\
    \ parsers (RST, PDTB) on the corpus, compare their results to the gold annotations\
    \ (for RST) and then assess the contribution of automatically-derived discourse\
    \ features for argumentation parsing. After reproducing the state-of-the-art Evidence\
    \ Graph model from Afantenos et al. (2018) for the microtexts, we find that PDTB\
    \ features can indeed improve its performance."

  abstract: This paper focuses on the real world application of scientific writing
    and on determining rhetorical moves, an important step in establishing the argument
    structure of biomedical articles. Using the observation that the structure of
    scholarly writing in laboratory-based experimental sciences closely follows laboratory
    procedures, we examine most closely the Methods section of the texts and adopt
    an approach of identifying rhetorical moves that are procedure-oriented. We also
    propose a verb-centric frame semantics with an effective set of semantic roles
    in order to support the analysis. These components are designed to support a computational
    model that extends a promising proposal of appropriate rhetorical moves for this
    domain, but one which is merely descriptive. Our work also contributes to the
    understanding of argument-related annotation schemes. In particular, we conduct
    a detailed study with human annotators to confirm that our selection of semantic
    roles is effective in determining the underlying rhetorical structure of existing
    biomedical articles in an extensive dataset. The annotated dataset that we produce
    provides the important knowledge needed for our ultimate goal of analyzing biochemistry
    articles.

  abstract: Rhetorical elements from scientific publications provide a more structured
    view of the document and allow algorithms to focus on particular parts of the
    text. We surveyed the literature for previously proposed schemes for rhetorical
    elements and present an overview of its current state of the art. We also searched
    for available tools using these schemes and applied four tools for our particular
    task of ranking biomedical abstracts based on text similarity. Comparison of the
    tools with two strong baselines shows that the predictions provided by the ArguminSci
    tool can support our use case of mining alternative methods for animal experiments.

  abstract: "We tackle the tasks of automatically identifying comparative sentences\
    \ and categorizing the intended preference (e.g., \u201CPython has better NLP\
    \ libraries than MATLAB\u201D \u2192 Python, better, MATLAB). To this end, we\
    \ manually annotate 7,199 sentences for 217 distinct target item pairs from several\
    \ domains (27% of the sentences contain an oriented comparison in the sense of\
    \ \u201Cbetter\u201D or \u201Cworse\u201D). A gradient boosting model based on\
    \ pre-trained sentence embeddings reaches an F1 score of 85% in our experimental\
    \ evaluation. The model can be used to extract comparative sentences for pro/con\
    \ argumentation in comparative / argument search engines or debating technologies."

  abstract: "In data ranking applications, pairwise annotation is often more consistent\
    \ than cardinal annotation for learning ranking models. We examine this in a case\
    \ study on ranking text passages for argument convincingness. Our task is to choose\
    \ text passages that provide the highest-quality, most-convincing arguments for\
    \ opposing sides of a topic. Using data from a deployed system within the Bing\
    \ search engine, we construct a pairwise-labeled dataset for argument convincingness\
    \ that is substantially more comprehensive in topical coverage compared to existing\
    \ public resources. We detail the process of extracting topical passages for queries\
    \ submitted to a search engine, creating annotated sets of passages aligned to\
    \ different stances on a topic, and assessing argument convincingness of passages\
    \ using pairwise annotation. Using a state-of-the-art convincingness model, we\
    \ evaluate several methods for using pairwise-annotated data examples to train\
    \ models for ranking passages. Our results show pairwise training outperforms\
    \ training that regresses to a target score for each passage. Our results also\
    \ show a simple \u2018win-rate\u2019 score is a better regression target than\
    \ the previously proposed page-rank target. Lastly, addressing the need to filter\
    \ noisy crowd-sourced annotations when constructing a dataset, we show that filtering\
    \ for transitivity within pairwise annotations is more effective than filtering\
    \ based on annotation confidence measures for individual examples."

  abstract: "Stance detection plays a pivot role in fake news detection. The task\
    \ involves determining the point of view or stance \u2013 for or against \u2013\
    \ a text takes towards a claim. One very important stage in employing stance detection\
    \ for fake news detection is the aggregation of multiple stance labels from different\
    \ text sources in order to compute a prediction for the veracity of a claim. Typically,\
    \ aggregation is treated as a credibility-weighted average of stance predictions.\
    \ In this work, we take the novel approach of applying, for aggregation, a gradual\

    \ detection. Our empirical evaluation shows that our method results in more accurate\

  abstract: "This paper examines the factors that govern persuasion for a priori UNDECIDED\
    \ versus DECIDED audience members in the context of on-line debates. We separately\
    \ study two types of influences: linguistic factors \u2014 features of the language\
    \ of the debate itself; and audience factors \u2014 features of an audience member\
    \ encoding demographic information, prior beliefs, and debate platform behavior.\
    \ In a study of users of a popular debate platform, we find first that different\
    \ combinations of linguistic features are critical for predicting persuasion outcomes\
    \ for UNDECIDED versus DECIDED members of the audience. We additionally find that\
    \ audience factors have more influence on predicting the side (PRO/CON) that persuaded\
    \ UNDECIDED users than for DECIDED users that flip their stance to the opposing\
    \ side. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the undecided and\
    \ decided audiences separately when studying linguistic factors of persuasion."

  abstract: "We study the problem of incremental domain adaptation of a generic neural\
    \ machine translation model with limited resources (e.g., budget and time) for\
    \ human translations or model training. In this paper, we propose a novel query\
    \ strategy for selecting \u201Cunlabeled\u201D samples from a new domain based\
    \ on sentence embeddings for Arabic. We accelerate the fine-tuning process of\
    \ the generic model to the target domain. Specifically, our approach estimates\
    \ the informativeness of instances from the target domain by comparing the distance\
    \ of their sentence embeddings to embeddings from the generic domain. We perform\
    \ machine translation experiments (Ar-to-En direction) for comparing a random\
    \ sampling baseline with our new approach, similar to active learning, using two\
    \ small update sets for simulating the work of human translators. For the prescribed\
    \ setting we can save more than 50% of the annotation costs without loss in quality,\
    \ demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."

  abstract: Parallel corpora available for building machine translation (MT) models
    for dialectal Arabic (DA) are rather limited. The scarcity of resources has prompted
    the use of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) abundant resources to complement the limited
    dialectal resource. However, dialectal clitics often differ between MSA and DA.
    This paper compares morphology-aware DA word segmentation to other word segmentation
    approaches like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Sub-word Regularization (SR). A set
    of experiments conducted on Egyptian Arabic (EA), Levantine Arabic (LA), and Gulf
    Arabic (GA) show that a sufficiently accurate morphology-aware segmentation used
    in conjunction with BPE outperforms the other word segmentation approaches.

  abstract: When speakers code-switch between their native language and a second language
    or language variant, they follow a syntactic pattern where words and phrases from
    the embedded language are inserted into the matrix language. This paper explores
    the possibility of utilizing this pattern in improving code-switching identification
    between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Arabic (EA). We try to answer
    the question of how strong is the POS signal in word-level code-switching identification.
    We build a deep learning model enriched with linguistic features (including POS
    tags) that outperforms the state-of-the-art results by 1.9% on the development
    set and 1.0% on the test set. We also show that in intra-sentential code-switching,
    the selection of lexical items is constrained by POS categories, where function
    words tend to come more often from the dialectal language while the majority of
    content words come from the standard language.

  abstract: Arabic sentiment analysis models have employed compositional embedding
    features to represent the Arabic dialectal content. These embeddings are usually
    composed via ordered, syntax-aware composition functions and learned within deep
    neural frameworks. With the free word order and the varying syntax nature across
    the different Arabic dialects, a sentiment analysis system developed for one dialect
    might not be efficient for the others. Here we present syntax-ignorant n-gram
    embeddings to be used in sentiment analysis of several Arabic dialects. The proposed
    embeddings were composed and learned using an unordered composition function and
    a shallow neural model. Five datasets of different dialects were used to evaluate
    the produced embeddings in the sentiment analysis task. The obtained results revealed
    that, our syntax-ignorant embeddings could outperform word2vec model and doc2vec
    both variant models in addition to hand-crafted system baselines, while a competent
    performance was noticed towards baseline systems that adopted more complicated
    neural architectures.

  abstract: Word Embeddings (WE) are getting increasingly popular and widely applied
    in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications due to their effectiveness
    in capturing semantic properties of words; Machine Translation (MT), Information
    Retrieval (IR) and Information Extraction (IE) are among such areas. In this paper,
    we propose an open source ArbEngVec which provides several Arabic-English cross-lingual
    word embedding models. To train our bilingual models, we use a large dataset with
    more than 93 million pairs of Arabic-English parallel sentences. In addition,
    we perform both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations for the different word embedding
    model variants. The extrinsic evaluation assesses the performance of models on
    the cross-language Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), while the intrinsic evaluation
    is based on the Word Translation (WT) task.

  abstract: 'Lexical ambiguity, a challenging phenomenon in all natural languages,
    is particularly prevalent for languages with diacritics that tend to be omitted
    in writing, such as Arabic. Omitting diacritics leads to an increase in the number
    of homographs: different words with the same spelling. Diacritic restoration could
    theoretically help disambiguate these words, but in practice, the increase in
    overall sparsity leads to performance degradation in NLP applications. In this
    paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a subset of words for diacritic
    restoration, which leads to selective homograph disambiguation. Compared to full
    or no diacritic restoration, these approaches yield selectively-diacritized datasets
    that balance sparsity and lexical disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection
    strategies extrinsically on several downstream applications: neural machine translation,
    part-of-speech tagging, and semantic textual similarity. Our experiments on Arabic
    show promising results, where our devised strategies on selective diacritization
    lead to a more balanced and consistent performance in downstream applications.'

  abstract: This paper presents the winning solution to the Arabic Named Entity Recognition
    challenge run by Topcoder.com. The proposed model integrates various tailored
    techniques together, including representation learning, feature engineering, sequence
    labeling, and ensemble learning. The final model achieves a test F_1 score of
    75.82% on the AQMAR dataset and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Detailed
    analyses are conducted to reveal both its strengths and limitations. Specifically,
    we observe that (1) representation learning modules can significantly boost the
    performance but requires a proper pre-processing and (2) the resulting embedding
    can be further enhanced with feature engineering due to the limited size of the
    training data. All implementations and pre-trained models are made public.

  abstract: "Arabic is a complex language with limited resources which makes it challenging\
    \ to produce accurate text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. The\
    \ utilization of transfer learning (TL) has recently shown promising results for\
    \ advancing accuracy of text classification in English. TL models are pre-trained\
    \ on large corpora, and then fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. In particular,\
    \ universal language models (ULMs), such as recently developed BERT, have achieved\
    \ state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks in English. In this paper, we\
    \ hypothesize that similar success can be achieved for Arabic. The work aims at\
    \ supporting the hypothesis by developing the first Universal Language Model in\
    \ Arabic (hULMonA - \u062D\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627 meaning our dream), demonstrating\
    \ its use for Arabic classifications tasks, and demonstrating how a pre-trained\
    \ multi-lingual BERT can also be used for Arabic. We then conduct a benchmark\
    \ study to evaluate both ULM successes with Arabic sentiment analysis. Experiment\
    \ results show that the developed hULMonA and multi-lingual ULM are able to generalize\
    \ well to multiple Arabic data sets and achieve new state of the art results in\
    \ Arabic Sentiment Analysis for some of the tested sets."

  abstract: We explore the extent to which neural networks can learn to identify semantically
    equivalent sentences from a small variable dataset using an end-to-end training.
    We collect a new noisy non-standardised user-generated Algerian (ALG) dataset
    and also translate it to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which serves as its regularised
    counterpart. We compare the performance of various models on both datasets and
    report the best performing configurations. The results show that relatively simple
    models composed of 2 LSTM layers outperform by far other more sophisticated attention-based
    architectures, for both ALG and MSA datasets.

  abstract: "In this paper, we tackle the problem of \u201Croot extraction\u201D from\
    \ words in the Semitic language family. A challenge in applying natural language\
    \ processing techniques to these languages is the data sparsity problem that arises\
    \ from their rich internal morphology, where the substructure is inherently non-concatenative\
    \ and morphemes are interdigitated in word formation. While previous automated\
    \ methods have relied on human-curated rules or multiclass classification, they\
    \ have not fully leveraged the various combinations of regular, sequential concatenative\
    \ morphology within the words and the internal interleaving within templatic stems\
    \ of roots and patterns. To address this, we propose a constrained sequence-to-sequence\
    \ root extraction method. Experimental results show our constrained model outperforms\
    \ a variety of methods at root extraction. Furthermore, by enriching word embeddings\
    \ with resulting decompositions, we show improved results on word analogy, word\
    \ similarity, and language modeling tasks."

  abstract: 'This paper tackles the problem of open domain factual Arabic question
    answering (QA) using Wikipedia as our knowledge source. This constrains the answer
    of any question to be a span of text in Wikipedia. Open domain QA for Arabic entails
    three challenges: annotated QA datasets in Arabic, large scale efficient information
    retrieval and machine reading comprehension. To deal with the lack of Arabic QA
    datasets we present the Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset (ARCD) composed of
    1,395 questions posed by crowdworkers on Wikipedia articles, and a machine translation
    of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (Arabic-SQuAD). Our system for open
    domain question answering in Arabic (SOQAL) is based on two components: (1) a
    document retriever using a hierarchical TF-IDF approach and (2) a neural reading
    comprehension model using the pre-trained bi-directional transformer BERT. Our
    experiments on ARCD indicate the effectiveness of our approach with our BERT-based
    reader achieving a 61.3 F1 score, and our open domain system SOQAL achieving a
    27.6 F1 score.'

  abstract: Segmentation serves as an integral part in many NLP applications including
    Machine Translation, Parsing, and Information Retrieval. When a model trained
    on the standard language is applied to dialects, the accuracy drops dramatically.
    However, there are more lexical items shared by the standard language and dialects
    than can be found by mere surface word matching. This shared lexicon is obscured
    by a lot of cliticization, gemination, and character repetition. In this paper,
    we prove that segmentation and base normalization of dialects can help in domain
    adaptation by reducing data sparseness. Segmentation will improve a system performance
    by reducing the number of OOVs, help isolate the differences and allow better
    utilization of the commonalities. We show that adding a small amount of dialectal
    segmentation training data reduced OOVs by 5% and remarkably improves POS tagging
    for dialects by 7.37% f-score, even though no dialect-specific POS training data
    is included.

  abstract: Assessing the credibility of online content has garnered a lot of attention
    lately. We focus on one such type of online content, namely weblogs or blogs for
    short. Some recent work attempted the task of automatically assessing the credibility
    of blogs, typically via machine learning. However, in the case of Arabic blogs,
    there are hardly any datasets available that can be used to train robust machine
    learning models for this difficult task. To overcome the lack of sufficient training
    data, we propose deep co-learning, a semi-supervised end-to-end deep learning
    approach to assess the credibility of Arabic blogs. In deep co-learning, multiple
    weak deep neural network classifiers are trained using a small labeled dataset,
    and each using a different view of the data. Each one of these classifiers is
    then used to classify unlabeled data, and its prediction is used to train the
    other classifiers in a semi-supervised fashion. We evaluate our deep co-learning
    approach on an Arabic blogs dataset, and we report significant improvements in
    performance compared to many baselines including fully-supervised deep learning
    models as well as ensemble models.

  abstract: To compile a modern dictionary that catalogues the words in currency,
    and to study linguistic patterns in the contemporary language, it is necessary
    to have a corpus of authentic texts that reflect current usage of the language.
    Although there are numerous Arabic corpora, none claims to be representative of
    the language in terms of the combination of geographical region, genre, subject
    matter, mode, and medium. This paper describes a 100-million-word corpus that
    takes the British National Corpus (BNC) as a model. The aim of the corpus is to
    be balanced, annotated, comprehensive, and representative of contemporary Arabic
    as written and spoken in Arab countries today. It will be different from most
    others in not being heavily-dominated by the news or in mixing the classical with
    the modern. In this paper is an outline of the methodology adopted for the design,
    construction, and annotation of this corpus. DIWAN (Alshargi and Rambow, 2015)
    was used to annotate a one-million-word snapshot of the corpus. DIWAN is a dialectal
    word annotation tool, but we upgraded it by adding a new tag-set that is based
    on traditional Arabic grammar and by adding the roots and morphological patterns
    of nouns and verbs. Moreover, the corpus we constructed covers the major spoken
    varieties of Arabic.

  abstract: This paper introduces the work on building a machine translation system
    for Arabic-to-Turkish in the news domain. Our work includes collecting parallel
    datasets in several ways for a new and low-resourced language pair, building baseline
    systems with state-of-the-art architectures and developing language specific algorithms
    for better translation. Parallel datasets are mainly collected three different
    ways; i) translating Arabic texts into Turkish by professional translators, ii)
    exploiting the web for open-source Arabic-Turkish parallel texts, iii) using back-translation.
    We per-formed preliminary experiments for Arabic-to-Turkish machine translation
    with neural(Marian) machine translation tools with a novel morphologically motivated
    vocabulary reduction method.

  abstract: "While transfer learning for text has been very active in the English\
    \ language, progress in Arabic has been slow, including the use of Domain Adaptation\
    \ (DA). Domain Adaptation is used to generalize the performance of any classifier\
    \ by trying to balance the classifier\u2019s accuracy for a particular task among\
    \ different text domains. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two variants\
    \ of a domain adaptation technique: the first is a base model called Domain Adversarial\
    \ Neural Network (DANN), while the second is a variation that incorporates representational\
    \ learning. Similar to previous approaches, we propose the use of proxy A-distance\
    \ as a metric to assess the success of generalization. We make use of ArSentDLEV,\
    \ a multi-topic dataset collected from the Levantine countries, to test the performance\
    \ of the models. We show the superiority of the proposed method in accuracy and\
    \ robustness when dealing with the Arabic language."

  abstract: Speech acts are the actions that a speaker intends when performing an
    utterance within conversations. In this paper, we proposed speech act classification
    for asynchronous conversations on Twitter using multiple machine learning methods
    including SVM and deep neural networks. We applied the proposed methods on the
    ArSAS tweets dataset. The obtained results show that superiority of deep learning
    methods compared to SVMs, where Bi-LSTM managed to achieve an accuracy of 87.5%
    and a macro-averaged F1 score 61.5%. We believe that our results are the first
    to be reported on the task of speech-act recognition for asynchronous conversations
    on Arabic Twitter.

    at the Arabic dialect identification challenge of the MADAR Shared Task (Bouamor
    et al., 2019) conducted during the Fourth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop
    (WANLP 2019). We participated to the Travel Domain Dialect Identification subtask.
    We built several systems and explored different techniques including conventional
    machine learning methods and deep learning algorithms. Deep learning approaches
    did not perform well on this task. We experimented several classification systems
    and we were able to identify the dialect of an input sentence with an F1-score
    of 65.41% on the official test set using only the training data supplied by the
    shared task organizers.

  abstract: We present MICHAEL, a simple lightweight method for automatic Arabic Dialect
    Identification on the MADAR travel domain Dialect Identification (DID). MICHAEL
    uses simple character-level features in order to perform a pre-processing free
    classification. More precisely, Character N-grams extracted from the original
    sentences are used to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. This system
    achieved an official score (accuracy) of 53.25% with 1<=N<=3 but showed a much
    better result with character 4-grams (62.17% accuracy).

  abstract: This paper presents the results of the experiments done as a part of MADAR
    Shared Task in WANLP 2019 on Arabic Fine-Grained Dialect Identification. Dialect
    Identification is one of the prominent tasks in the field of Natural language
    processing where the subsequent language modules can be improved based on it.
    We explored the use of different features like char, word n-gram, language model
    probabilities, etc on different classifiers. Results show that these features
    help to improve dialect classification accuracy. Results also show that traditional
    machine learning classifier tends to perform better when compared to neural network
    models on this task in a low resource setting.

  abstract: Arabic dialect identification is an inherently complex problem, as Arabic
    dialect taxonomy is convoluted and aims to dissect a continuous space rather than
    a discrete one. In this work, we present machine and deep learning approaches
    to predict 21 fine-grained dialects form a set of given tweets per user. We adopted
    numerous feature extraction methods most of which showed improvement in the final
    model, such as word embedding, Tf-idf, and other tweet features. Our results show
    that a simple LinearSVC can outperform any complex deep learning model given a
    set of curated features. With a relatively complex user voting mechanism, we were
    able to achieve a Macro-Averaged F1-score of 71.84% on MADAR shared subtask-2.
    Our best submitted model ranked second out of all participating teams.

  abstract: In this paper, we present two approaches for Arabic Fine-Grained Dialect
    Identification. The first approach is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM,
    BGRU) using hierarchical classification. The main idea is to separate the classification
    process for a sentence from a given text in two stages. We start with a higher
    level of classification (8 classes) and then the finer-grained classification
    (26 classes). The second approach is given by a voting system based on Naive Bayes
    and Random Forest. Our system achieves an F1 score of 63.02 % on the subtask evaluation
    dataset.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a Dialect Identification system (ArbDialectID)
    that competed at Task 1 of the MADAR shared task, MADARTravel Domain Dialect Identification.
    We build a course and a fine-grained identification model to predict the label
    (corresponding to a dialect of Arabic) of a given text. We build two language
    models by extracting features at two levels (words and characters). We firstly
    build a coarse identification model to classify each sentence into one out of
    six dialects, then use this label as a feature for the fine-grained model that
    classifies the sentence among 26 dialects from different Arab cities, after that
    we apply ensemble voting classifier on both sub-systems. Our system ranked 1st
    that achieving an f-score of 67.32%. Both the models and our feature engineering
    tools are made available to the research community.

  abstract: Our submission to the MADAR shared task on Arabic dialect identification
    employed a language modeling technique called Prediction by Partial Matching,
    an ensemble of neural architectures, and sources of additional data for training
    word embeddings and auxiliary language models. We found several of these techniques
    provided small boosts in performance, though a simple character-level language
    model was a strong baseline, and a lower-order LM achieved best performance on
    Subtask 2. Interestingly, word embeddings provided no consistent benefit, and
    ensembling struggled to outperform the best component submodel. This suggests
    the variety of architectures are learning redundant information, and future work
    may focus on encouraging decorrelated learning.

  abstract: We present our deep leaning system submitted to MADAR shared task 2 focused
    on twitter user dialect identification. We develop tweet-level identification
    models based on GRUs and BERT in supervised and semi-supervised set-tings. We
    then introduce a simple, yet effective, method of porting tweet-level labels at
    the level of users. Our system ranks top 1 in the competition, with 71.70% macro
    F1 score and 77.40% accuracy.

  abstract: This paper describes the QC-GO team submission to the MADAR Shared Task
    Subtask 1 (travel domain dialect identification) and Subtask 2 (Twitter user location
    identification). In our participation in both subtasks, we explored a number of
    approaches and system combinations to obtain the best performance for both tasks.
    These include deep neural nets and heuristics. Since individual approaches suffer
    from various shortcomings, the combination of different approaches was able to
    fill some of these gaps. Our system achieves F1-Scores of 66.1% and 67.0% on the
    development sets for Subtasks 1 and 2 respectively.

  abstract: "We introduce novel computational models for modeling semantic bleaching,\
    \ a widespread category of change in which words become more abstract or lose\
    \ elements of meaning, like the development of \u201Carrive\u201D from its earlier\
    \ meaning \u2018become at shore.\u2019 We validate our methods on a widespread\
    \ case of bleaching in English: de-adjectival adverbs that originate as manner\
    \ adverbs (as in \u201Cawfully behaved\u201D) and later become intensifying adverbs\
    \ (as in \u201Cawfully nice\u201D). Our methods formally quantify three reflexes\
    \ of bleaching: decreasing similarity to the source meaning (e.g., \u201Cawful\u201D\
    ), increasing similarity to a fully bleached prototype (e.g., \u201Cvery\u201D\
    ), and increasing productivity (e.g., the breadth of adjectives that an adverb\
    \ modifies). We also test a new causal model and find evidence that bleaching\
    \ is initially triggered in contexts such as \u201Cconspicuously evident\u201D\
    \ and \u201Cinsanely jealous\u201D, where an adverb premodifies a semantically\
    \ similar adjective. These contexts provide a form of \u201Cbridging context\u201D\
    \ (Evans and Wilkins, 2000) that allow a manner adverb to be reinterpreted as\
    \ an intensifying adverb similar to \u201Cvery\u201D."

  abstract: The esoteric definitions of poetry are insufficient in enveloping the
    changes in poetry that the age of mechanical reproduction has witnessed with the
    widespread proliferation of the use of digital media and artificial intelligence.
    They are also insufficient in distinguishing between prose and poetry, as the
    content of both prose and poetry can be poetic. Using quotes as prose considering
    their poetic, context-free and celebrated nature, stylistic differences between
    poetry and prose are delved into. Novel features in grammar and meter are justified
    as distinguishing features. Datasets of popular prose and poetry spanning across
    1870-1920 and 1970-2019 have been created, and multiple experiments have been
    conducted to prove that prose and poetry in the latter period are more alike than
    they were in the former. The accuracy of classification of poetry and prose of
    1970-2019 is significantly lesser than that of 1870-1920, thereby proving the
    convergence of poetry and prose in 1970-2019.

  abstract: "The paper focuses on diachronic evaluation of semantic changes of harm-related\

    harassment\u201D, \u201Cprejudice\u201D, and \u201Ctrauma\u201D became broader\
    \ during the last four decades. We evaluate semantic changes using two models:\
    \ an LSA-based model from Sagi et al. (2009) and a diachronic adaptation of word2vec\
    \ from Hamilton et al. (2016), that are trained on a large corpus of journal abstracts\
    \ covering the period of 1980\u2013 2019. Several concepts showed evidence of\
    \ broadening. \u201CAddiction\u201D moved from physiological dependency on a substance\
    \ to include psychological dependency on gaming and the Internet. Similarly, \u201C\
    harassment\u201D and \u201Ctrauma\u201D shifted towards more psychological meanings.\
    \ On the other hand, \u201Cbullying\u201D has transformed into a more victim-related\

  abstract: Diachronic word embeddings play a key role in capturing interesting patterns
    about how language evolves over time. Most of the existing work focuses on studying
    corpora spanning across several decades, which is understandably still not a possibility
    when working on social media-based user-generated content. In this work, we address
    the problem of studying semantic changes in a large Twitter corpus collected over
    five years, a much shorter period than what is usually the norm in diachronic
    studies. We devise a novel attentional model, based on Bernoulli word embeddings,
    that are conditioned on contextual extra-linguistic (social) features such as
    network, spatial and socio-economic variables, which are associated with Twitter
    users, as well as topic-based features. We posit that these social features provide
    an inductive bias that helps our model to overcome the narrow time-span regime
    problem. Our extensive experiments reveal that our proposed model is able to capture
    subtle semantic shifts without being biased towards frequency cues and also works
    well when certain contextual features are absent. Our model fits the data better
    than current state-of-the-art dynamic word embedding models and therefore is a
    promising tool to study diachronic semantic changes over small time periods.

  abstract: I survey some recent approaches to studying change in the lexicon, particularly
    change in meaning across phylogenies. I briefly sketch an evolutionary approach
    to language change and point out some issues in recent approaches to studying
    semantic change that rely on temporally stratified word embeddings. I draw illustrations
    from lexical cognate models in Pama-Nyungan to identify meaning classes most appropriate
    for lexical phylogenetic inference, particularly highlighting the importance of
    variation in studying change over time.

  abstract: "Word meaning changes over time, depending on linguistic and extra-linguistic\
    \ factors. Associating a word\u2019s correct meaning in its historical context\
    \ is a central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of\
    \ NLP tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search in historical\
    \ texts. Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to\
    \ address this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations\
    \ of semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich\
    \ metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual\
    \ information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is particularly\
    \ critical in the case of ancient languages, where lack of data and long diachronic\
    \ span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between polysemy (the fact that\
    \ a word has several senses) and semantic change (the process of acquiring, losing,\
    \ or changing senses), and current systems perform poorly on these languages.\
    \ We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model that leverages categorical\
    \ metadata about the texts\u2019 genre to boost inference and uncover the evolution\
    \ of meanings in Ancient Greek corpora. In a new evaluation framework, our model\
    \ achieves improved predictive performance compared to the state of the art."

  abstract: "The concept of \u2018markedness\u2019 has been influential in phonology\
    \ for almost a century. Theoretical phonology has found it useful to describe\
    \ some segments as more \u2018marked\u2019 than others, referring to a cluster\
    \ of language-internal and -external properties (Jakobson 1968, Haspelmath 2006).\
    \ We argue, using a simple mathematical model based on Evolutionary Phonology\
    \ (Blevins 2004), that markedness is an epiphenomenon of phonetically grounded\
    \ sound change."

  abstract: This paper introduces a novel method to track collocational variations
    in diachronic corpora that can identify several changes undergone by these phraseological
    combinations and to propose alternative solutions found in later periods. The
    strategy consists of extracting syntactically-related candidates of collocations
    and ranking them using statistical association measures. Then, starting from the
    first period of the corpus, the system tracks each combination over time, verifying
    different types of historical variation such as the loss of one or both lemmas,
    the disappearance of the collocation, or its diachronic frequency trend. Using
    a distributional semantics strategy, it also proposes other linguistic structures
    which convey similar meanings to those extinct collocations. A case study on historical
    corpora of Portuguese and Spanish shows that the system speeds up and facilitates
    the finding of some diachronic changes and phraseological shifts that are harder
    to identify without using automated methods.

  abstract: 'We aim to provide computational evidence for the era of authorship of
    two important old Thai texts: Traiphumikatha and Pumratchatham. The era of authorship
    of these two books is still an ongoing debate among Thai literature scholars.
    Analysis of old Thai texts present a challenge for standard natural language processing
    techniques, due to the lack of corpora necessary for building old Thai word and
    syllable segmentation. We propose an accurate and interpretable model to classify
    each segment as one of the three eras of authorship (Sukhothai, Ayuddhya, or Rattanakosin)
    without sophisticated linguistic preprocessing. Contrary to previous hypotheses,
    our model suggests that both books were written during the Sukhothai era. Moreover,
    the second half of the Pumratchtham is uncharacteristic of the Sukhothai era,
    which may have confounded literary scholars in the past. Further, our model reveals
    that the most indicative linguistic changes stem from unidirectional grammaticalized
    words and polyfunctional words, which show up as most dominant features in the
    model.'

  abstract: In this work we propose a data-driven methodology for identifying temporal
    trends in a corpus of medieval charters. We have used perplexities derived from
    RNNs as a distance measure between documents and then, performed clustering on
    those distances. We argue that perplexities calculated by such language models
    are representative of temporal trends. The clusters produced using the K-Means
    algorithm give an insight of the differences in language in different time periods
    at least partly due to language change. We suggest that the temporal distribution
    of the individual clusters might provide a more nuanced picture of temporal trends
    compared to discrete bins, thus providing better results when used in a classification
    task.

  abstract: Contemporary debates on filter bubbles and polarization in public and
    social media raise the question to what extent news media of the past exhibited
    biases. This paper specifically examines bias related to gender in six Dutch national
    newspapers between 1950 and 1990. We measure bias related to gender by comparing
    local changes in word embedding models trained on newspapers with divergent ideological
    backgrounds. We demonstrate clear differences in gender bias and changes within
    and between newspapers over time. In relation to themes such as sexuality and
    leisure, we see the bias moving toward women, whereas, generally, the bias shifts
    in the direction of men, despite growing female employment number and feminist
    movements. Even though Dutch society became less stratified ideologically (depillarization),
    we found an increasing divergence in gender bias between religious and social-democratic
    on the one hand and liberal newspapers on the other. Methodologically, this paper
    illustrates how word embeddings can be used to examine historical language change.
    Future work will investigate how fine-tuning deep contextualized embedding models,
    such as ELMO, might be used for similar tasks with greater contextual information.

  abstract: Traditional historical linguistics lacks the possibility to empirically
    assess its assumptions regarding the phonetic systems of past languages and language
    stages since most current methods rely on comparative tools to gain insights into
    phonetic features of sounds in proto- or ancestor languages. The paper at hand
    presents a computational method based on deep neural networks to predict phonetic
    features of historical sounds where the exact quality is unknown and to test the
    overall coherence of reconstructed historical phonetic features. The method utilizes
    the principles of coarticulation, local predictability and statistical phonological
    constraints to predict phonetic features by the features of their immediate phonetic
    environment. The validity of this method will be assessed using New High German
    phonetic data and its specific application to diachronic linguistics will be demonstrated
    in a case study of the phonetic system Proto-Indo-European.

    Often, those advantages cannot be fully exploited due to the sparse but high-dimensional

    a novel, free, easy-to-use, interactive visualization tool for parallel, multilingual,

  abstract: We investigate some aspects of the history of antisemitism in France,
    one of the cradles of modern antisemitism, using diachronic word embeddings. We
    constructed a large corpus of French books and periodicals issues that contain
    a keyword related to Jews and performed a diachronic word embedding over the 1789-1914
    period. We studied the changes over time in the semantic spaces of 4 target words
    and performed embedding projections over 6 streams of antisemitic discourse. This
    allowed us to track the evolution of antisemitic bias in the religious, economic,
    socio-politic, racial, ethic and conspiratorial domains. Projections show a trend
    of growing antisemitism, especially in the years starting in the mid-80s and culminating
    in the Dreyfus affair. Our analysis also allows us to highlight the peculiar adverse
    bias towards Judaism in the broader context of other religions.

  abstract: "Language change is often assessed against a set of pre-determined time\
    \ periods in order to be able to trace its diachronic trajectory. This is problematic,\
    \ since a pre-determined periodization might obscure significant developments\
    \ and lead to false assumptions about the data. Moreover, these time periods can\
    \ be based on factors which are either arbitrary or non-linguistic, e.g., dividing\
    \ the corpus data into equidistant stages or taking into account language-external\
    \ events. Addressing this problem, in this paper we present a data-driven approach\
    \ to periodization: \u2018DiaHClust\u2019. DiaHClust is based on iterative hierarchical\
    \ clustering and offers a multi-layered perspective on change from text-level\
    \ to broader time periods. We demonstrate the usefulness of DiaHClust via a case\
    \ study investigating syntactic change in Icelandic, modelling the syntactic system\
    \ of the language in terms of vectors of syntactic change."

    to characterize the degree of compositionality in lexical semantics. Our models
    reveal some interesting yet contrastive patterns of long-term change in multiple
    languages: Indo-European languages put more weight on subword units in newer words,
    while conversely Chinese puts less weights on the subwords, but more weight on
    the word as a whole. Our method provides novel evidence and methodology that enriches
    existing theories in evolutionary linguistics. The resulting word vectors also

  abstract: We propose Word Embedding Networks, a novel method that is able to learn
    word embeddings of individual data slices while simultaneously aligning and ordering
    them without feeding temporal information a priori to the model. This gives us
    the opportunity to analyse the dynamics in word embeddings on a large scale in
    a purely data-driven manner. In experiments on two different newspaper corpora,
    the New York Times (English) and die Zeit (German), we were able to show that
    time actually determines the dynamics of semantic change. However, there is by
    no means a uniform evolution, but instead times of faster and times of slower
    change.

  abstract: Semantic divergence in related languages is a key concern of historical
    linguistics. Intra-lingual semantic shift has been previously studied in computational
    linguistics, but this can only provide a limited picture of the evolution of word
    meanings, which often develop in a multilingual environment. In this paper we
    investigate semantic change across languages by measuring the semantic distance
    of cognate words in multiple languages. By comparing current meanings of cognates
    in different languages, we hope to uncover information about their previous meanings,
    and about how they diverged in their respective languages from their common original
    etymon. We further study the properties of their semantic divergence, by analyzing
    how the features of words such as frequency and polysemy are related to the divergence
    in their meaning, and thus make the first steps towards formulating laws of cross-lingual
    semantic change.

  abstract: "We train a diachronic long short-term memory (LSTM) part-of-speech tagger\
    \ on a large corpus of American English from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.\
    \ We analyze the tagger\u2019s ability to implicitly learn temporal structure\
    \ between years, and the extent to which this knowledge can be transferred to\
    \ date new sentences. The learned year embeddings show a strong linear correlation\
    \ between their first principal component and time. We show that temporal information\
    \ encoded in the model can be used to predict novel sentences\u2019 years of composition\
    \ relatively well. Comparisons to a feedforward baseline suggest that the temporal\
    \ change learned by the LSTM is syntactic rather than purely lexical. Thus, our\
    \ results suggest that our tagger is implicitly learning to model syntactic change\
    \ in American English over the course of the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries."

  abstract: The paper showcases the application of word embeddings to change in language
    use in the domain of science, focusing on the Late Modern English period (17-19th
    century). Historically, this is the period in which many registers of English
    developed, including the language of science. Our overarching interest is the
    linguistic development of scientific writing to a distinctive (group of) register(s).
    A register is marked not only by the choice of lexical words (discourse domain)
    but crucially by grammatical choices which indicate style. The focus of the paper
    is on the latter, tracing words with primarily grammatical functions (function
    words and some selected, poly-functional word forms) diachronically. To this end,
    we combine diachronic word embeddings with appropriate visualization and exploratory
    techniques such as clustering and relative entropy for meaningful aggregation
    of data and diachronic comparison.

  abstract: "The distribution of most dialectal variants have not only spatial but\
    \ also temporal patterns. Based on the \u2018apparent time hypothesis\u2019, much\
    \ of dialect change is happening through younger speakers accepting innovations.\
    \ Thus, synchronic diversity can be interpreted diachronically. With the assumption\
    \ of the \u2018contact effect\u2019, i.e. contact possibility (contact and isolation)\
    \ between speaker communities being responsible for language change, and the apparent\
    \ time hypothesis, we aim to predict the usage of dialectal variants. In this\
    \ paper we model the contact possibility based on two of the most important factors\
    \ in sociolinguistics to be affecting language change: age and distance. The first\
    \ steps of the approach involve modeling contact possibility using a logistic\
    \ predictor, taking the age of respondents into account. We test the global, and\
    \ the local role of age for variation where the local level means spatial subsets\
    \ around each survey site, chosen based on k nearest neighbors. The prediction\
    \ approach is tested on Swiss German syntactic survey data, featuring multiple\
    \ respondents from different age cohorts at survey sites. The results show the\
    \ relative success of the logistic prediction approach and the limitations of\
    \ the method, therefore further proposals are made to develop the methodology."

  abstract: "We measure the intensity of diachronic semantic shifts in adjectives\
    \ in English, Norwegian and Russian across 5 decades. This is done in order to\
    \ test the hypothesis that evaluative adjectives are more prone to temporal semantic\
    \ change. To this end, 6 different methods of quantifying semantic change are\
    \ used. Frequency-controlled experimental results show that, depending on the\
    \ particular method, evaluative adjectives either do not differ from other types\
    \ of adjectives in terms of semantic change or appear to actually be less prone\
    \ to shifting (particularly, to \u2018jitter\u2019-type shifting). Thus, in spite\
    \ of many well-known examples of semantically changing evaluative adjectives (like\
    \ \u2018terrific\u2019 or \u2018incredible\u2019), it seems that such cases are\
    \ not specific to this particular type of words."

  abstract: We investigate changes in the meanings of words used in the UK Parliament
    across two different epochs. We use word embeddings to explore changes in the
    distribution of words of interest and uncover words that appear to have undergone
    semantic transformation in the intervening period, and explore different ways
    of obtaining target words for this purpose. We find that semantic changes are
    generally in line with those found in other corpora, and little evidence that
    parliamentary language is more static than general English. It also seems that
    words with senses that have been recorded in the dictionary as having fallen into
    disuse do not undergo semantic changes in this domain.

    \ which consists of about 75k poems with more than 11 million tokens, with poems\
    \ ranging from the 16th to early 20th century. We then track semantic change in\
    \ this corpus by investigating the rise of tropes (\u2018love is magic\u2019)\
    \ over time and detecting change points of meaning, which we find to occur particularly\
    \ within the German Romantic period. Additionally, through self-similarity, we\
    \ reconstruct literary periods and find evidence that the law of linear semantic\
    \ change also applies to poetry."

  abstract: We present work in progress on the temporal progression of compositionality
    in noun-noun compounds. Previous work has proposed computational methods for determining
    the compositionality of compounds. These methods try to automatically determine
    how transparent the meaning of the compound as a whole is with respect to the
    meaning of its parts. We hypothesize that such a property might change over time.
    We use the time-stamped Google Books corpus for our diachronic investigations,
    and first examine whether the vector-based semantic spaces extracted from this
    corpus are able to predict compositionality ratings, despite their inherent limitations.
    We find that using temporal information helps predicting the ratings, although
    correlation with the ratings is lower than reported for other corpora. Finally,
    we show changes in compositionality over time for a selection of compounds.

  abstract: We address in this paper the issue of text reuse in liturgical manuscripts
    of the middle ages. More specifically, we study variant readings of the Obsecro
    Te prayer, part of the devotional Books of Hours often used by Christians as guidance
    for their daily prayers. We aim at automatically extracting and categorising pairs
    of words and expressions that exhibit variant relations. For this purpose, we
    adopt a linguistic classification that allows to better characterize the variants
    than edit operations. Then, we study the evolution of Obsecro Te texts from a
    temporal and geographical axis. Finally, we contrast several unsupervised state-of-the-art
    approaches for the automatic extraction of Obsecro Te variants. Based on the manual
    observation of 772 Obsecro Te copies which show more than 21,000 variants, we
    show that the proposed methodology is helpful for an automatic study of variants
    and may serve as basis to analyze and to depict useful information from devotional
    texts.

  abstract: "In this study, we propose to focus on understanding the evolution of\
    \ a specific scientific concept\u2014that of Circular Economy (CE)\u2014by analysing\
    \ how the language used in academic discussions has changed semantically. It is\
    \ worth noting that the meaning and central theme of this concept has remained\
    \ the same; however, we hypothesise that it has undergone semantic change by way\
    \ of additional layers being added to the concept. We have shown that semantic\
    \ change in language is a reflection of shifts in scientific ideas, which in turn\
    \ help explain the evolution of a concept. Focusing on the CE concept, our analysis\
    \ demonstrated that the change over time in the language used in academic discussions\
    \ of CE is indicative of the way in which the concept evolved and expanded."

  abstract: This paper proposes a Gaussian Process model of sound change targeted
    toward questions in Indo-Aryan dialectology. Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide
    a flexible means of expressing covariance between outcomes, and can be extended
    to a wide variety of probability distributions. We find that GP models fare better
    in terms of some key posterior predictive checks than models that do not express
    covariance between sound changes, and outline directions for future work.

  abstract: "Certain phenomena of interest to linguists mainly occur in low-resource\
    \ languages, such as contact-induced language change. We show that it is possible\
    \ to study contact-induced language change computationally in a historical variety\
    \ of a low-resource language, Early-Modern Frisian, by creating a model using\
    \ features that were established to be relevant in a closely related language,\
    \ modern Dutch. This allows us to test two hypotheses on two types of language\
    \ contact that may have taken place between Frisian and Dutch during this time.\
    \ Our model shows that Frisian verb cluster word orders are associated with different\
    \ context features than Dutch verb orders, supporting the \u2018learned borrowing\u2019\

  abstract: Historical change typically is the result of complex interactions between
    several linguistic factors. Identifying the relevant factors and understanding
    how they interact across the temporal dimension is the core remit of historical
    linguistics. With respect to corpus work, this entails a separate annotation,
    extraction and painstaking pair-wise comparison of the relevant bits of information.
    This paper presents a significant extension of HistoBankVis, a multilayer visualization
    system which allows a fast and interactive exploration of complex linguistic data.
    Linguistic factors can be understood as data dimensions which show complex interrelationships.
    We model these relationships with the Parallel Sets technique. We demonstrate
    the powerful potential of this technique by applying the system to understanding
    the interaction of case, grammatical relations and word order in the history of
    Icelandic.

  abstract: While sequence-to-sequence models have shown remarkable generalization
    power across several natural language tasks, their construct of solutions are
    argued to be less compositional than human-like generalization. In this paper,
    we present seq2attn, a new architecture that is specifically designed to exploit
    attention to find compositional patterns in the input. In seq2attn, the two standard
    components of an encoder-decoder model are connected via a transcoder, that modulates
    the information flow between them. We show that seq2attn can successfully generalize,
    without requiring any additional supervision, on two tasks which are specifically
    constructed to challenge the compositional skills of neural networks. The solutions
    found by the model are highly interpretable, allowing easy analysis of both the
    types of solutions that are found and potential causes for mistakes. We exploit
    this opportunity to introduce a new paradigm to test compositionality that studies
    the extent to which a model overgeneralizes when confronted with exceptions. We
    show that seq2attn exhibits such overgeneralization to a larger degree than a
    standard sequence-to-sequence model.

  abstract: Neural methods for sentiment analysis have led to quantitative improvements
    over previous approaches, but these advances are not always accompanied with a
    thorough analysis of the qualitative differences. Therefore, it is not clear what
    outstanding conceptual challenges for sentiment analysis remain. In this work,
    we attempt to discover what challenges still prove a problem for sentiment classifiers
    for English and to provide a challenging dataset. We collect the subset of sentences
    that an (oracle) ensemble of state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers misclassify
    and then annotate them for 18 linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena, such as
    negation, sarcasm, modality, etc. Finally, we provide a case study that demonstrates
    the usefulness of the dataset to probe the performance of a given sentiment classifier
    with respect to linguistic phenomena.

  abstract: We simulate first- and second-order context overlap and show that Skip-Gram
    with Negative Sampling is similar to Singular Value Decomposition in capturing
    second-order co-occurrence information, while Pointwise Mutual Information is
    agnostic to it. We support the results with an empirical study finding that the
    models react differently when provided with additional second-order information.
    Our findings reveal a basic property of Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling and point
    towards an explanation of its success on a variety of tasks.

  abstract: Monotonicity reasoning is one of the important reasoning skills for any
    intelligent natural language inference (NLI) model in that it requires the ability
    to capture the interaction between lexical and syntactic structures. Since no
    test set has been developed for monotonicity reasoning with wide coverage, it
    is still unclear whether neural models can perform monotonicity reasoning in a
    proper way. To investigate this issue, we introduce the Monotonicity Entailment
    Dataset (MED). Performance by state-of-the-art NLI models on the new test set
    is substantially worse, under 55%, especially on downward reasoning. In addition,
    analysis using a monotonicity-driven data augmentation method showed that these
    models might be limited in their generalization ability in upward and downward
    reasoning.

  abstract: Self-explaining text categorization requires a classifier to make a prediction
    along with supporting evidence. A popular type of evidence is sub-sequences extracted
    from the input text which are sufficient for the classifier to make the prediction.
    In this work, we define multi-granular ngrams as basic units for explanation,
    and organize all ngrams into a hierarchical structure, so that shorter ngrams
    can be reused while computing longer ngrams. We leverage the tree-structured LSTM
    to learn a context-independent representation for each unit via parameter sharing.
    Experiments on medical disease classification show that our model is more accurate,
    efficient and compact than the BiLSTM and CNN baselines. More importantly, our
    model can extract intuitive multi-granular evidence to support its predictions.

  abstract: The Transformer is a fully attention-based alternative to recurrent networks
    that has achieved state-of-the-art results across a range of NLP tasks. In this
    paper, we analyze the structure of attention in a Transformer language model,
    the GPT-2 small pretrained model. We visualize attention for individual instances
    and analyze the interaction between attention and syntax over a large corpus.
    We find that attention targets different parts of speech at different layer depths
    within the model, and that attention aligns with dependency relations most strongly
    in the middle layers. We also find that the deepest layers of the model capture
    the most distant relationships. Finally, we extract exemplar sentences that reveal
    highly specific patterns targeted by particular attention heads.

  abstract: "Language is a powerful tool which can be used to state the facts as well\
    \ as express our views and perceptions. Most of the times, we find a subtle bias\
    \ towards or against someone or something. When it comes to politics, media houses\
    \ and journalists are known to create bias by shrewd means such as misinterpreting\
    \ reality and distorting viewpoints towards some parties. This misinterpretation\
    \ on a large scale can lead to the production of biased news and conspiracy theories.\
    \ Automating bias detection in newspaper articles could be a good challenge for\
    \ research in NLP. We proposed a headline attention network for this bias detection.\
    \ Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a structure that mirrors\
    \ a person\u2019s way of reading a news article (ii) it has attention mechanism\
    \ applied on the article based on its headline, enabling it to attend to more\
    \ critical content to predict bias. As the required datasets were not available,\
    \ we created a dataset comprising of 1329 news articles collected from various\
    \ Telugu newspapers and marked them for bias towards a particular political party.\
    \ The experiments conducted on it demonstrated that our model outperforms various\
    \ baseline methods by a substantial margin."

  abstract: Neural network models have been very successful in natural language inference,
    with the best models reaching 90% accuracy in some benchmarks. However, the success
    of these models turns out to be largely benchmark specific. We show that models
    trained on a natural language inference dataset drawn from one benchmark fail
    to perform well in others, even if the notion of inference assumed in these benchmarks
    is the same or similar. We train six high performing neural network models on
    different datasets and show that each one of these has problems of generalizing
    when we replace the original test set with a test set taken from another corpus
    designed for the same task. In light of these results, we argue that most of the
    current neural network models are not able to generalize well in the task of natural
    language inference. We find that using large pre-trained language models helps
    with transfer learning when the datasets are similar enough. Our results also
    highlight that the current NLI datasets do not cover the different nuances of
    inference extensively enough.

  abstract: Character-level models have been used extensively in recent years in NLP
    tasks as both supplements and replacements for closed-vocabulary token-level word
    representations. In one popular architecture, character-level LSTMs are used to
    feed token representations into a sequence tagger predicting token-level annotations
    such as part-of-speech (POS) tags. In this work, we examine the behavior of POS
    taggers across languages from the perspective of individual hidden units within
    the character LSTM. We aggregate the behavior of these units into language-level
    metrics which quantify the challenges that taggers face on languages with different
    morphological properties, and identify links between synthesis and affixation
    preference and emergent behavior of the hidden tagger layer. In a comparative
    experiment, we show how modifying the balance between forward and backward hidden
    units affects model arrangement and performance in these types of languages.

  abstract: "Recently, several methods have been proposed to explain the predictions\
    \ of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular of LSTMs. The goal of these\
    \ methods is to understand the network\u2019s decisions by assigning to each input\
    \ variable, e.g., a word, a relevance indicating to which extent it contributed\
    \ to a particular prediction. In previous works, some of these methods were not\
    \ yet compared to one another, or were evaluated only qualitatively. We close\
    \ this gap by systematically and quantitatively comparing these methods in different\
    \ settings, namely (1) a toy arithmetic task which we use as a sanity check, (2)\
    \ a five-class sentiment prediction of movie reviews, and besides (3) we explore\
    \ the usefulness of word relevances to build sentence-level representations. Lastly,\
    \ using the method that performed best in our experiments, we show how specific\
    \ linguistic phenomena such as the negation in sentiment analysis reflect in terms\
    \ of relevance patterns, and how the relevance visualization can help to understand\
    \ the misclassification of individual samples."

  abstract: 'We present a detailed comparison of two types of sequence to sequence
    models trained to conduct a compositional task. The models are architecturally
    identical at inference time, but differ in the way that they are trained: our
    baseline model is trained with a task-success signal only, while the other model
    receives additional supervision on its attention mechanism (Attentive Guidance),
    which has shown to be an effective method for encouraging more compositional solutions.
    We first confirm that the models with attentive guidance indeed infer more compositional
    solutions than the baseline, by training them on the lookup table task presented
    by Liska et al. (2019). We then do an in-depth analysis of the structural differences
    between the two model types, focusing in particular on the organisation of the
    parameter space and the hidden layer activations and find noticeable differences
    in both these aspects. Guided networks focus more on the components of the input
    rather than the sequence as a whole and develop small functional groups of neurons
    with specific purposes that use their gates more selectively. Results from parameter
    heat maps, component swapping and graph analysis also indicate that guided networks
    exhibit a more modular structure with a small number of specialized, strongly
    connected neurons.'

  abstract: "The generalized Dyck language has been used to analyze the ability of\
    \ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn context-free grammars (CFGs). Recent\
    \ studies draw conflicting conclusions on their performance, especially regarding\
    \ the generalizability of the models with respect to the depth of recursion. In\
    \ this paper, we revisit several common models and experimental settings, discuss\
    \ the potential problems of the tasks and analyses. Furthermore, we explore the\
    \ use of attention mechanisms within the seq2seq framework to learn the Dyck language,\
    \ which could compensate for the limited encoding ability of RNNs. Our findings\
    \ reveal that attention mechanisms still cannot truly generalize over the recursion\
    \ depth, although they perform much better than other models on the closing bracket\
    \ tagging task. Moreover, this also suggests that this commonly used task is not\
    \ sufficient to test a model\u2019s understanding of CFGs."

  abstract: A common approach in knowledge base completion (KBC) is to learn representations
    for entities and relations in order to infer missing facts by generalizing existing
    ones. A shortcoming of standard models is that they do not explain their predictions
    to make them verifiable easily to human inspection. In this paper, we propose
    the Context Path Model (CPM) which generates explanations for new facts in KBC
    by providing sets of context paths as supporting evidence for these triples. For
    example, a new triple (Theresa May, nationality, Britain) may be explained by
    the path (Theresa May, born in, Eastbourne, contained in, Britain). The CPM is
    formulated as a wrapper that can be applied on top of various existing KBC models.
    We evaluate it for the well-established TransE model. We observe that its performance
    remains very close despite the added complexity, and that most of the paths proposed
    as explanations provide meaningful evidence to assess the correctness.

  abstract: 'The recent wide-spread and strong interest in RNNs has spurred detailed
    investigations of the distributed representations they generate and specifically
    if they exhibit properties similar to those characterising human languages. Results
    are at present inconclusive. In this paper, we extend previous work on long-distance
    dependencies in three ways. We manipulate word embeddings to translate them in
    a space that is attuned to the linguistic properties under study. We extend the
    work to sentence embeddings and to new languages. We confirm previous negative
    results: word embeddings and sentence embeddings do not unequivocally encode fine-grained
    linguistic properties of long-distance dependencies.'

  abstract: "Derivation is a type of a word-formation process which creates new words\
    \ from existing ones by adding, changing or deleting affixes. In this paper, we\
    \ explore the potential of word embeddings to identify properties of word derivations\
    \ in the morphologically rich Czech language. We extract derivational relations\
    \ between pairs of words from DeriNet, a Czech lexical network, which organizes\
    \ almost one million Czech lemmas into derivational trees. For each such pair,\
    \ we compute the difference of the embeddings of the two words, and perform unsupervised\
    \ clustering of the resulting vectors. Our results show that these clusters largely\
    \ match manually annotated semantic categories of the derivational relations (e.g.\
    \ the relation \u2018bake\u2013baker\u2019 belongs to category \u2018actor\u2019\
    , and a correct clustering puts it into the same cluster as \u2018govern\u2013\
    governor\u2019)."

  abstract: "Work using artificial languages as training input has shown that LSTMs\
    \ are capable of inducing the stack-like data structures required to represent\
    \ context-free and certain mildly context-sensitive languages \u2014 formal language\
    \ classes which correspond in theory to the hierarchical structures of natural\
    \ language. Here we present a suite of experiments probing whether neural language\
    \ models trained on linguistic data induce these stack-like data structures and\
    \ deploy them while incrementally predicting words. We study two natural language\
    \ phenomena: center embedding sentences and syntactic island constraints on the\
    \ filler\u2013gap dependency. In order to properly predict words in these structures,\
    \ a model must be able to temporarily suppress certain expectations and then recover\
    \ those expectations later, essentially pushing and popping these expectations\
    \ on a stack. Our results provide evidence that models can successfully suppress\
    \ and recover expectations in many cases, but do not fully recover their previous\
    \ grammatical state."

  abstract: In this paper, we define and apply representational stability analysis
    (ReStA), an intuitive way of analyzing neural language models. ReStA is a variant
    of the popular representational similarity analysis (RSA) in cognitive neuroscience.
    While RSA can be used to compare representations in models, model components,
    and human brains, ReStA compares instances of the same model, while systematically
    varying single model parameter. Using ReStA, we study four recent and successful
    neural language models, and evaluate how sensitive their internal representations
    are to the amount of prior context. Using RSA, we perform a systematic study of
    how similar the representational spaces in the first and second (or higher) layers
    of these models are to each other and to patterns of activation in the human brain.
    Our results reveal surprisingly strong differences between language models, and
    give insights into where the deep linguistic processing, that integrates information
    over multiple sentences, is happening in these models. The combination of ReStA
    and RSA on models and brains allows us to start addressing the important question
    of what kind of linguistic processes we can hope to observe in fMRI brain imaging
    data. In particular, our results suggest that the data on story reading from Wehbe
    et al./ (2014) contains a signal of shallow linguistic processing, but show no
    evidence on the more interesting deep linguistic processing.

  abstract: We propose a novel approach to the study of how artificial neural network
    perceive the distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences, a crucial
    task in the growing field of synthetic linguistics. The method is based on performance
    measures of language models trained on corpora and fine-tuned with either grammatical
    or ungrammatical sentences, then applied to (different types of) grammatical or
    ungrammatical sentences. The results show that both in the difficult and highly
    symmetrical task of detecting subject islands and in the more open CoLA dataset,
    grammatical sentences give rise to better scores than ungrammatical ones, possibly
    because they can be better integrated within the body of linguistic structural
    knowledge that the language model has accumulated.

  abstract: The quality of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been shown to significantly
    degrade when confronted with source-side noise. We present the first large-scale
    study of state-of-the-art English-to-German NMT on real grammatical noise, by
    evaluating on several Grammar Correction corpora. We present methods for evaluating
    NMT robustness without true references, and we use them for extensive analysis
    of the effects that different grammatical errors have on the NMT output. We also
    introduce a technique for visualizing the divergence distribution caused by a
    source-side error, which allows for additional insights.

  abstract: Neural network architectures have been augmented with differentiable stacks
    in order to introduce a bias toward learning hierarchy-sensitive regularities.
    It has, however, proven difficult to assess the degree to which such a bias is
    effective, as the operation of the differentiable stack is not always interpretable.
    In this paper, we attempt to detect the presence of latent representations of
    hierarchical structure through an exploration of the unsupervised learning of
    constituency structure. Using a technique due to Shen et al. (2018a,b), we extract
    syntactic trees from the pushing behavior of stack RNNs trained on language modeling
    and classification objectives. We find that our models produce parses that reflect
    natural language syntactic constituencies, demonstrating that stack RNNs do indeed
    infer linguistically relevant hierarchical structure.

  abstract: "How and to what extent does BERT encode syntactically-sensitive hierarchical\

    \ that contextual representations like BERT perform well on tasks that require\
    \ sensitivity to linguistic structure. We present here two studies which aim to\

    \ The first of these focuses on the identification of structurally-defined elements\
    \ using diagnostic classifiers, while the second explores BERT\u2019s representation\
    \ of subject-verb agreement and anaphor-antecedent dependencies through a quantitative\
    \ assessment of self-attention vectors. In both cases, we find that BERT encodes\
    \ positional information about word tokens well on its lower layers, but switches\
    \ to a hierarchically-oriented encoding on higher layers. We conclude then that\
    \ BERT\u2019s representations do indeed model linguistically relevant aspects\
    \ of hierarchical structure, though they do not appear to show the sharp sensitivity\
    \ to hierarchical structure that is found in human processing of reflexive anaphora."

  abstract: We inspect the multi-head self-attention in Transformer NMT encoders for
    three source languages, looking for patterns that could have a syntactic interpretation.
    In many of the attention heads, we frequently find sequences of consecutive states
    attending to the same position, which resemble syntactic phrases. We propose a
    transparent deterministic method of quantifying the amount of syntactic information
    present in the self-attentions, based on automatically building and evaluating
    phrase-structure trees from the phrase-like sequences. We compare the resulting
    trees to existing constituency treebanks, both manually and by computing precision
    and recall.

  abstract: "Large pre-trained neural networks such as BERT have had great recent\
    \ success in NLP, motivating a growing body of research investigating what aspects\
    \ of language they are able to learn from unlabeled data. Most recent analysis\
    \ has focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal) or internal vector\
    \ representations (e.g., probing classifiers). Complementary to these works, we\
    \ propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models\
    \ and apply them to BERT. BERT\u2019s attention heads exhibit patterns such as\
    \ attending to delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly attending\
    \ over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar\
    \ behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic\
    \ notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find heads that attend to\
    \ the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions,\
    \ and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an\
    \ attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial\
    \ syntactic information is captured in BERT\u2019s attention."

  abstract: 'Assessing how individuals perform different activities is key information
    for modeling health states of individuals and populations. Descriptions of activity
    performance in clinical free text are complex, including syntactic negation and
    similarities to textual entailment tasks. We explore a variety of methods for
    the novel task of classifying four types of assertions about activity performance:
    Able, Unable, Unclear, and None (no information). We find that ensembling an SVM
    trained with lexical features and a CNN achieves 77.9% macro F1 score on our task,
    and yields nearly 80% recall on the rare Unclear and Unable samples. Finally,
    we highlight several challenges in classifying performance assertions, including
    capturing information about sources of assistance, incorporating syntactic structure
    and negation scope, and handling new modalities at test time. Our findings establish
    a strong baseline for this novel task, and identify intriguing areas for further
    research.'

  abstract: "The objective of this work is to develop an automated diagnosis system\

    \ Our clinical corpus consists of about 180,000 ED notes based on ten years of\
    \ patient visits to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department of the National\
    \ University Hospital (NUH), Singapore. We propose a novel neural network approach\

    \ ED notes without any feature engineering. On a test set of 2,000 ED notes with\
    \ equal number of appendicitis (positive) and non-appendicitis (negative) diagnosis\
    \ and in which all the negative ED notes only consist of abdominal-related diagnosis,\
    \ our model is able to achieve a promising F_0.5-score of 0.895 while ED doctors\
    \ achieve F_0.5-score of 0.900. Visualization shows that our model is able to\

  abstract: This paper proposes a dataset and method for automatically generating
    paraphrases for clinical questions relating to patient-specific information in
    electronic health records (EHRs). Crowdsourcing is used to collect 10,578 unique
    questions across 946 semantically distinct paraphrase clusters. This corpus is
    then used with a deep learning-based question paraphrasing method utilizing variational
    autoencoder and LSTM encoder/decoder. The ultimate use of such a method is to
    improve the performance of automatic question answering methods for EHRs.

  abstract: Systematic comparison of methods for relation extraction (RE) is difficult
    because many experiments in the field are not described precisely enough to be
    completely reproducible and many papers fail to report ablation studies that would
    highlight the relative contributions of their various combined techniques. In
    this work, we build a unifying framework for RE, applying this on three highly
    used datasets (from the general, biomedical and clinical domains) with the ability
    to be extendable to new datasets. By performing a systematic exploration of modeling,
    pre-processing and training methodologies, we find that choices of preprocessing
    are a large contributor performance and that omission of such information can
    further hinder fair comparison. Other insights from our exploration allow us to
    provide recommendations for future research in this area.

  abstract: "Despite recent advances in the application of deep neural networks to\
    \ various kinds of medical data, extracting information from unstructured textual\
    \ sources remains a challenging task. The challenges of training and interpreting\
    \ document classification models are amplified when dealing with small and highly\
    \ technical datasets, as are common in the clinical domain. Using a dataset of\
    \ de-identified clinical letters gathered at a memory clinic, we construct several\
    \ recurrent neural network models for letter classification, and evaluate them\
    \ on their ability to build meaningful representations of the documents and predict\
    \ patients\u2019 diagnoses. Additionally, we probe sentence embedding models in\
    \ order to build a human-interpretable representation of the neural network\u2019\
    s features, using a simple and intuitive technique based on perturbative approaches\
    \ to sentence importance. In addition to showing which sentences in a document\
    \ are most informative about the patient\u2019s condition, this method reveals\
    \ the types of sentences that lead the model to make incorrect diagnoses. Furthermore,\
    \ we identify clusters of sentences in the embedding space that correlate strongly\
    \ with importance scores for each clinical diagnosis class."

  abstract: Inspired by the success of the General Language Understanding Evaluation
    benchmark, we introduce the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE)
    benchmark to facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations
    in the biomedicine domain. The benchmark consists of five tasks with ten datasets
    that cover both biomedical and clinical texts with different dataset sizes and
    difficulties. We also evaluate several baselines based on BERT and ELMo and find
    that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes
    achieves the best results. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes
    publicly available at https://github.com/ ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark.

    for real-time Clinical Decision Support (CDS). We present a deep learning approach
    to combining in real time available diagnosis codes (ICD codes) and free-text
    notes: Patient Context Vectors. Patient Context Vectors are created by averaging
    ICD code embeddings, and by predicting the same from free-text notes via a Convolutional
    Neural Network. The Patient Context Vectors were then simply appended to available
    structured data (vital signs and lab results) to build prediction models for a

    demonstrate the utility of Patient Context Vectors as a means of summarizing the

  abstract: In an era when large amounts of data are generated daily in various fields,
    the biomedical field among others, linguistic resources can be exploited for various
    tasks of Natural Language Processing. Moreover, increasing number of biomedical
    documents are available in languages other than English. To be able to extract
    information from natural language free text resources, methods and tools are needed
    for a variety of languages. This paper presents the creation of the MoNERo corpus,
    a gold standard biomedical corpus for Romanian, annotated with both part of speech
    tags and named entities. MoNERo comprises 154,825 morphologically annotated tokens
    and 23,188 entity annotations belonging to four entity semantic groups corresponding
    to UMLS Semantic Groups.

  abstract: Domain adaptation remains one of the most challenging aspects in the wide-spread
    use of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems. Current state-of-the-art methods
    are typically trained on large-scale datasets, but their performances do not directly
    transfer to low-resource domain-specific settings. In this paper, we propose two
    approaches for domain adaptation in the biological domain that involves pre-training
    LSTM-CRF based on existing large-scale datasets and adapting it for a low-resource
    corpus of biological processes. Our first approach defines a mapping between the
    source labels and the target labels, and the other approach modifies the final
    CRF layer in sequence-labeling neural network architecture. We perform our experiments
    on ProcessBank dataset which contains less than 200 paragraphs on biological processes.
    We improve over the previous state-of-the-art system on this dataset by 21 F1
    points. We also show that, by incorporating event-event relationship in ProcessBank,
    we are able to achieve an additional 2.6 F1 gain, giving us possible insights
    into how to improve SRL systems for biological process using richer annotations.

  abstract: Automatic identification and expansion of ambiguous abbreviations are
    essential for biomedical natural language processing applications, such as information
    retrieval and question answering systems. In this paper, we present DEep Contextualized
    Biomedical Abbreviation Expansion (DECBAE) model. DECBAE automatically collects
    substantial and relatively clean annotated contexts for 950 ambiguous abbreviations
    from PubMed abstracts using a simple heuristic. Then it utilizes BioELMo to extract
    the contextualized features of words, and feed those features to abbreviation-specific
    bidirectional LSTMs, where the hidden states of the ambiguous abbreviations are
    used to assign the exact definitions. Our DECBAE model outperforms other baselines
    by large margins, achieving average accuracy of 0.961 and macro-F1 of 0.917 on
    the dataset. It also surpasses human performance for expanding a sample abbreviation,
    and remains robust in imbalanced, low-resources and clinical settings.

  abstract: 'Patients and their families often require a better understanding of medical
    information provided by doctors. We currently address this issue by improving
    the identification of difficult to understand medical words. We introduce novel
    embeddings received from RNN - FrnnMUTE (French RNN Medical Understandability
    Text Embeddings) which allow to reach up to 87.0 F1 score in identification of
    difficult words. We also note that adding pre-trained FastText word embeddings
    to the feature set substantially improves the performance of the model which classifies
    words according to their difficulty. We study the generalizability of different
    models through three cross-validation scenarios which allow testing classifiers
    in real-world conditions: understanding of medical words by new users, and classification
    of new unseen words by the automatic models. The RNN - FrnnMUTE embeddings and
    the categorization code are being made available for the research.'

  abstract: Systematic reviews are important in evidence based medicine, but are expensive
    to produce. Automating or semi-automating the data extraction of index test, target
    condition, and reference standard from articles has the potential to decrease
    the cost of conducting systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy, but relevant
    training data is not available. We create a distantly supervised dataset of approximately
    90,000 sentences, and let two experts manually annotate a small subset of around
    1,000 sentences for evaluation. We evaluate the performance of BioBERT and logistic
    regression for ranking the sentences, and compare the performance for distant
    and direct supervision. Our results suggest that distant supervision can work
    as well as, or better than direct supervision on this problem, and that distantly
    trained models can perform as well as, or better than human annotators.

  abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of automatically constructing a
    relevant corpus of scientific articles about food-drug interactions. There is
    a growing number of scientific publications that describe food-drug interactions
    but currently building a high-coverage corpus that can be used for information
    extraction purposes is not trivial. We investigate several methods for automating
    the query selection process using an expert-curated corpus of food-drug interactions.
    Our experiments show that index term features along with a decision tree classifier
    are the best approach for this task and that feature selection approaches and
    in particular gain ratio outperform frequency-based methods for query selection.

  abstract: 'Distributed representations of text can be used as features when training
    a statistical classifier. These representations may be created as a composition
    of word vectors or as context-based sentence vectors. We compare the two kinds
    of representations (word versus context) for three classification problems: influenza
    infection classification, drug usage classification and personal health mention
    classification. For statistical classifiers trained for each of these problems,
    context-based representations based on ELMo, Universal Sentence Encoder, Neural-Net
    Language Model and FLAIR are better than Word2Vec, GloVe and the two adapted using
    the MESH ontology. There is an improvement of 2-4% in the accuracy when these
    context-based representations are used instead of word-based representations.'

  abstract: "Knowledge base construction is crucial for summarising, understanding\
    \ and inferring relationships between biomedical entities. However, for many practical\
    \ applications such as drug discovery, the scarcity of relevant facts (e.g. gene\
    \ X is therapeutic target for disease Y) severely limits a domain expert\u2019\
    s ability to create a usable knowledge base, either directly or by training a\
    \ relation extraction model. In this paper, we present a simple and effective\
    \ method of extracting new facts with a pre-specified binary relationship type\
    \ from the biomedical literature, without requiring any training data or hand-crafted\
    \ rules. Our system discovers, ranks and presents the most salient patterns to\
    \ domain experts in an interpretable form. By marking patterns as compatible with\
    \ the desired relationship type, experts indirectly batch-annotate candidate pairs\
    \ whose relationship is expressed with such patterns in the literature. Even with\
    \ a complete absence of seed data, experts are able to discover thousands of high-quality\
    \ pairs with the desired relationship within minutes. When a small number of relevant\
    \ pairs do exist - even when their relationship is more general (e.g. gene X is\
    \ biologically associated with disease Y) than the relationship of interest -\
    \ our system leverages them in order to i) learn a better ranking of the patterns\
    \ to be annotated or ii) generate weakly labelled pairs in a fully automated manner.\
    \ We evaluate our method both intrinsically and via a downstream knowledge base\
    \ completion task, and show that it is an effective way of constructing knowledge\
    \ bases when few or no relevant facts are already available."

  abstract: Automatic extraction of relations and interactions between biological
    entities from scientific literature remains an extremely challenging problem in
    biomedical information extraction and natural language processing in general.
    One of the reasons for slow progress is the relative scarcity of standardized
    and publicly available benchmarks. In this paper we introduce BioRelEx, a new
    dataset of fully annotated sentences from biomedical literature that capture binding
    interactions between proteins and/or biomolecules. To foster reproducible research
    on the interaction extraction task, we define a precise and transparent evaluation
    process, tools for error analysis and significance tests. Finally, we conduct
    extensive experiments to evaluate several baselines, including SciIE, a recently
    introduced neural multi-task architecture that has demonstrated state-of-the-art
    performance on several tasks.

  abstract: 'To automatically analyse complex trajectory information enclosed in clinical
    text (e.g. timing of symptoms, duration of treatment), it is important to understand
    the related temporal aspects, anchoring each event on an absolute point in time.
    In the clinical domain, few temporally annotated corpora are currently available.
    Moreover, underlying annotation schemas - which mainly rely on the TimeML standard
    - are not necessarily easily applicable for applications such as patient timeline
    reconstruction. In this work, we investigated how temporal information is documented
    in clinical text by annotating a corpus of medical reports with time expressions
    (TIMEXes), based on TimeML. The developed corpus is available to the NLP community.
    Starting from our annotations, we analysed the suitability of the TimeML TIMEX
    schema for capturing timeline information, identifying challenges and possible
    solutions. As a result, we propose a novel annotation schema that could be useful
    for timeline reconstruction: CALendar EXpression (CALEX).'

  abstract: The automatic processing of clinical documents, such as Electronic Health
    Records (EHRs), could benefit substantially from the enrichment of medical terminologies
    with terms encountered in clinical practice. To integrate such terms into existing
    knowledge sources, they must be linked to corresponding concepts. We present a
    method for the semantic categorization of clinical terms based on their surface
    form. We find that features based on sublanguage properties can provide valuable
    cues for the classification of term variants.

  abstract: In this paper, we presented an improved methodology to extract PIO elements,
    from abstracts of medical papers, that reduces ambiguity. The proposed technique
    was used to build a dataset of PIO elements that we call PICONET. We further proposed
    a model of PIO elements classification using state of the art BERT embedding.
    In addition, we investigated a contextualized embedding, BioBERT, trained on medical
    corpora. It has been found that using the BioBERT embedding improved the classification
    accuracy, outperforming the BERT-based model. This result reinforces the idea
    of the importance of embedding contextualization in subsequent classification
    tasks in this specific context.Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of the model,
    we have investigated an ensemble method based on the LGBM algorithm. We trained
    the LGBM model, with the above models as base learners, to learn a linear combination
    of the predicted probabilities for the 3 classes with the TF-IDF score and the
    QIEF that optimizes the classification. The results indicate that these text features
    were good features to consider in order to boost the deeply contextualized classification
    model. We compared the performance of the classifier when using the features with
    one of the base learners and the case where we combine the base learners along
    with the features. We obtained the highest score in terms of AUC when we combine
    the base learners.The present work resulted in the creation of a PIO element dataset,
    PICONET, and a classification tool. These constitute and important component of
    our system of automatic mining of medical abstracts. We intend to extend the dataset
    to full medical articles. The model will be modified to take into account the
    higher complexity of full text data and more efficient features for model boosting
    will be investigated.

  abstract: 'A major obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    methods in the biomedical domain is data accessibility. This problem can be addressed
    by generating medical data artificially. Most previous studies have focused on
    the generation of short clinical text, and evaluation of the data utility has
    been limited. We propose a generic methodology to guide the generation of clinical
    text with key phrases. We use the artificial data as additional training data
    in two key biomedical NLP tasks: text classification and temporal relation extraction.
    We show that artificially generated training data used in conjunction with real
    training data can lead to performance boosts for data-greedy neural network algorithms.
    We also demonstrate the usefulness of the generated data for NLP setups where
    it fully replaces real training data.'

  abstract: Question answering (QA) is a challenging task in natural language processing
    (NLP), especially when it is applied to specific domains. While models trained
    in the general domain can be adapted to a new target domain, their performance
    often degrades significantly due to domain mismatch. Alternatively, one can require
    a large amount of domain-specific QA data, but such data are rare, especially
    for the medical domain. In this study, we first collect a large-scale Chinese
    medical QA corpus called ChiMed; second we annotate a small fraction of the corpus
    to check the quality of the answers; third, we extract two datasets from the corpus
    and use them for the relevancy prediction task and the adoption prediction task.
    Several benchmark models are applied to the datasets, producing good results for
    both tasks.

  abstract: 'The text of clinical notes can be a valuable source of patient information
    and clinical assessments. Historically, the primary approach for exploiting clinical
    notes has been information extraction: linking spans of text to concepts in a
    detailed domain ontology. However, recent work has demonstrated the potential
    of supervised machine learning to extract document-level codes directly from the
    raw text of clinical notes. We propose to bridge the gap between the two approaches
    with two novel syntheses: (1) treating extracted concepts as features, which are
    used to supplement or replace the text of the note; (2) treating extracted concepts
    as labels, which are used to learn a better representation of the text. Unfortunately,
    the resulting concepts do not yield performance gains on the document-level clinical
    coding task. We explore possible explanations and future research directions.'

  abstract: Textual data are useful for accessing expert information. Yet, since the
    texts are representative of distinct language uses, it is necessary to build specific
    corpora in order to be able to design suitable NLP tools. In some domains, such
    as medical domain, it may be complicated to access the representative textual
    data and their semantic annotations, while there exists a real need for providing
    efficient tools and methods. Our paper presents a corpus of clinical cases written
    in French, and their semantic annotations. Thus, we manually annotated a set of
    717 files into four general categories (age, gender, outcome, and origin) for
    a total number of 2,835 annotations. The values of age, gender, and outcome are
    normalized. A subset with 70 files has been additionally manually annotated into
    27 categories for a total number of 5,198 annotations.

  abstract: A large percentage of medical information is in unstructured text format
    in electronic medical record systems. Manual extraction of information from clinical
    notes is extremely time consuming. Natural language processing has been widely
    used in recent years for automatic information extraction from medical texts.
    However, algorithms trained on data from a single healthcare provider are not
    generalizable and error-prone due to the heterogeneity and uniqueness of medical
    documents. We develop a two-stage federated natural language processing method
    that enables utilization of clinical notes from different hospitals or clinics
    without moving the data, and demonstrate its performance using obesity and comorbities
    phenotyping as medical task. This approach not only improves the quality of a
    specific clinical task but also facilitates knowledge progression in the whole
    healthcare system, which is an essential part of learning health system. To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first application of federated machine learning
    in clinical NLP.

  abstract: We consider the task of detecting sentences that express causality, as
    a step towards mining causal relations from texts. To bypass the scarcity of causal
    instances in relation extraction datasets, we exploit transfer learning, namely
    ELMO and BERT, using a bidirectional GRU with self-attention ( BIGRUATT ) as a
    baseline. We experiment with both generic public relation extraction datasets
    and a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset, a subset of which we make
    publicly available. We find that transfer learning helps only in very small datasets.
    With larger datasets, BIGRUATT reaches a performance plateau, then larger datasets
    and transfer learning do not help.

  abstract: Network Embedding (NE) methods, which map network nodes to low-dimensional
    feature vectors, have wide applications in network analysis and bioinformatics.
    Many existing NE methods rely only on network structure, overlooking other information
    associated with the nodes, e.g., text describing the nodes. Recent attempts to
    combine the two sources of information only consider local network structure.
    We extend NODE2VEC, a well-known NE method that considers broader network structure,
    to also consider textual node descriptors using recurrent neural encoders. Our
    method is evaluated on link prediction in two networks derived from UMLS. Experimental
    results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to previous
    work.

  abstract: The purpose of automatic text simplification is to transform technical
    or difficult to understand texts into a more friendly version. The semantics must
    be preserved during this transformation. Automatic text simplification can be
    done at different levels (lexical, syntactic, semantic, stylistic...) and relies
    on the corresponding knowledge and resources (lexicon, rules...). Our objective
    is to propose methods and material for the creation of transformation rules from
    a small set of parallel sentences differentiated by their technicity. We also
    propose a typology of transformations and quantify them. We work with French-language
    data related to the medical domain, although we assume that the method can be
    exploited on texts in any language and from any domain.

  abstract: Despite recent advances in natural language processing, many statistical
    models for processing text perform extremely poorly under domain shift. Processing
    biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural
    language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available
    models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical
    biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library.
    We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate
    their robustness on several tasks and datasets. Models and code are available
    at https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/.

  abstract: Chemical patents are an important resource for chemical information. However,
    few chemical Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems have been evaluated on patent
    documents, due in part to their structural and linguistic complexity. In this
    paper, we explore the NER performance of a BiLSTM-CRF model utilising pre-trained
    word embeddings, character-level word representations and contextualized ELMo
    word representations for chemical patents. We compare word embeddings pre-trained
    on biomedical and chemical patent corpora. The effect of tokenizers optimized
    for the chemical domain on NER performance in chemical patents is also explored.
    The results on two patent corpora show that contextualized word representations
    generated from ELMo substantially improve chemical NER performance w.r.t. the
    current state-of-the-art. We also show that domain-specific resources such as
    word embeddings trained on chemical patents and chemical-specific tokenizers,
    have a positive impact on NER performance.

  abstract: "The availability of large-scale and real-time data on social media has\
    \ motivated research into adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADR classification helps\
    \ to identify negative effects of drugs, which can guide health professionals\
    \ and pharmaceutical companies in making medications safer and advocating patients\u2019\
    \ safety. Based on the observation that in social media, negative sentiment is\
    \ frequently expressed towards ADRs, this study presents a neural model that combines\
    \ sentiment analysis with transfer learning techniques to improve ADR detection\
    \ in social media postings. Our system is firstly trained to classify sentiment\
    \ in tweets concerning current affairs, using the SemEval17-task4A corpus. We\
    \ then apply transfer learning to adapt the model to the task of detecting ADRs\
    \ in social media postings. We show that, in combination with rich representations\
    \ of words and their contexts, transfer learning is beneficial, especially given\
    \ the large degree of vocabulary overlap between the current affairs posts in\
    \ the SemEval17-task4A corpus and posts about ADRs. We compare our results with\
    \ previous approaches, and show that our model can outperform them by up to 3%\

  abstract: In research best practices can change over time as new discoveries are
    made and novel methods are implemented. Scientific publications reporting about
    the latest facts and current state-of-the-art can be possibly outdated after some
    years or even proved to be false. A publication usually sheds light only on the
    knowledge of the period it has been published. Thus, the aspect of time can play
    an essential role in the reliability of the presented information. In Natural
    Language Processing many methods focus on information extraction from text, such
    as detecting entities and their relationship to each other. Those methods mostly
    focus on the facts presented in the text itself and not on the aspects of knowledge
    which changes over time. This work instead examines the evolution in biomedical
    knowledge over time using scientific literature in terms of diachronic change.
    Mainly the usage of temporal and distributional concept representations are explored
    and evaluated by a proof-of-concept.

  abstract: Randomized controlled trials assess the effects of an experimental intervention
    by comparing it to a control intervention with regard to some variables - trial
    outcomes. Statistical hypothesis testing is used to test if the experimental intervention
    is superior to the control. Statistical significance is typically reported for
    the measured outcomes and is an important characteristic of the results. We propose
    a machine learning approach to automatically extract reported outcomes, significance
    levels and the relation between them. We annotated a corpus of 663 sentences with
    2,552 outcome - significance level relations (1,372 positive and 1,180 negative
    relations). We compared several classifiers, using a manually crafted feature
    set, and a number of deep learning models. The best performance (F-measure of
    94%) was shown by the BioBERT fine-tuned model.

  abstract: This paper describes the models designated for the MEDIQA 2019 shared
    tasks by the team PANLP. We take advantages of the recent advances in pre-trained
    bidirectional transformer language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and
    MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019b). We find that pre-trained language models can significantly
    outperform traditional deep learning models. Transfer learning from the NLI task
    to the RQE task is also experimented, which proves to be useful in improving the
    results of fine-tuning MT-DNN large. A knowledge distillation process is implemented,
    to distill the knowledge contained in a set of models and transfer it into an
    single model, whose performance turns out to be comparable with that obtained
    by the ensemble of that set of models. Finally, for test submissions, model ensemble
    and a re-ranking process are implemented to boost the performances. Our models
    participated in all three tasks and ranked the 1st place for the RQE task, and
    the 2nd place for the NLI task, and also the 2nd place for the QA task.

  abstract: "Parallel deep learning architectures like fine-tuned BERT and MT-DNN,\
    \ have quickly become the state of the art, bypassing previous deep and shallow\
    \ learning methods by a large margin. More recently, pre-trained models from large\
    \ related datasets have been able to perform well on many downstream tasks by\
    \ just fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets (similar to transfer learning).\
    \ However, using powerful models on non-trivial tasks, such as ranking and large\
    \ document classification, still remains a challenge due to input size limitations\
    \ of parallel architecture and extremely small datasets (insufficient for fine-tuning).\
    \ In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system, trained in a multi-task setting,\
    \ to filter and re-rank answers in the medical domain. We use task-specific pre-trained\
    \ models as deep feature extractors. Our model achieves the highest Spearman\u2019\
    s Rho and Mean Reciprocal Rank of 0.338 and 0.9622 respectively, on the ACL-BioNLP\

  abstract: This paper describes our competing system to enter the MEDIQA-2019 competition.
    We use a multi-source transfer learning approach to transfer the knowledge from
    MT-DNN and SciBERT to natural language understanding tasks in the medical domain.
    For transfer learning fine-tuning, we use multi-task learning on NLI, RQE and
    QA tasks on general and medical domains to improve performance. The proposed methods
    are proved effective for natural language understanding in the medical domain,
    and we rank the first place on the QA task.

  abstract: While deep learning techniques have shown promising results in many natural
    language processing (NLP) tasks, it has not been widely applied to the clinical
    domain. The lack of large datasets and the pervasive use of domain-specific language
    (i.e. abbreviations and acronyms) in the clinical domain causes slower progress
    in NLP tasks than that of the general NLP tasks. To fill this gap, we employ word/subword-level
    based models that adopt large-scale data-driven methods such as pre-trained language
    models and transfer learning in analyzing text for the clinical domain. Empirical
    results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods by achieving 90.6%
    accuracy in medical domain natural language inference task. Furthermore, we inspect
    the independent strengths of the proposed approaches in quantitative and qualitative
    manners. This analysis will help researchers to select necessary components in
    building models for the medical domain.

  abstract: Natural language inference (NLI) is challenging, especially when it is
    applied to technical domains such as biomedical settings. In this paper, we propose
    a hybrid approach to biomedical NLI where different types of information are exploited
    for this task. Our base model includes a pre-trained text encoder as the core
    component, and a syntax encoder and a feature encoder to capture syntactic and
    domain-specific information. Then we combine the output of different base models
    to form more powerful ensemble models. Finally, we design two conflict resolution
    strategies when the test data contain multiple (premise, hypothesis) pairs with
    the same premise. We train our models on the MedNLI dataset, yielding the best
    performance on the test set of the MEDIQA 2019 Task 1.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our system and results submitted for the Natural
    Language Inference (NLI) track of the MEDIQA 2019 Shared Task. As KU_ai team,
    we used BERT as our baseline model and pre-processed the MedNLI dataset to mitigate
    the negative impact of de-identification artifacts. Moreover, we investigated
    different pre-training and transfer learning approaches to improve the performance.
    We show that pre-training the language model on rich biomedical corpora has a
    significant effect in teaching the model domain-specific language. In addition,
    training the model on large NLI datasets such as MultiNLI and SNLI helps in learning
    task-specific reasoning. Finally, we ensembled our highest-performing models,
    and achieved 84.7% accuracy on the unseen test dataset and ranked 10th out of
    17 teams in the official results.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Adversarial Multi-Task
    Network (AMTN) for jointly modeling Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) and
    medical Question Answering (QA) tasks. AMTN utilizes a pre-trained BioBERT model
    and an Interactive Transformer to learn the shared semantic representations across
    different task through parameter sharing mechanism. Meanwhile, an adversarial
    training strategy is introduced to separate the private features of each task
    from the shared representations. Experiments on BioNLP 2019 RQE and QA Shared
    Task datasets show that our model benefits from the shared representations of
    both tasks provided by multi-task learning and adversarial training, and obtains
    significant improvements upon the single-task models.

  abstract: In medical domain, given a medical question, it is difficult to manually
    select the most relevant information from a large number of search results. BioNLP
    2019 proposes Question Answering (QA) task, which encourages the use of text mining
    technology to automatically judge whether a search result is an answer to the
    medical question. The main challenge of QA task is how to mine the semantic relation
    between question and answer. We propose BioBERT Transformer model to tackle this
    challenge, which applies Transformers to extract semantic relation between different
    words in questions and answers. Furthermore, BioBERT is utilized to encode medical
    domain-specific contextualized word representations. Our method has reached the
    accuracy of 76.24% and spearman of 17.12% on the BioNLP 2019 QA task.

  abstract: This paper presents the submissions by TeamDr.Quad to the ACL-BioNLP 2019
    shared task on Textual Inference and Question Entailment in the Medical Domain.
    Our system is based on the prior work Liu et al. (2019) which uses a multi-task
    objective function for textual entailment. In this work, we explore different
    strategies for generalizing state-of-the-art language understanding models to
    the specialized medical domain. Our results on the shared task demonstrate that
    incorporating domain knowledge through data augmentation is a powerful strategy
    for addressing challenges posed specialized domains such as medicine.

  abstract: This paper presents a multi-task learning approach to natural language
    inference (NLI) and question entailment (RQE) in the biomedical domain. Recognizing
    textual inference relations and question similarity can address the issue of answering
    new consumer health questions by mapping them to Frequently Asked Questions on
    reputed websites like the NIH. We show that leveraging information from parallel
    tasks across domains along with medical knowledge integration allows our model
    to learn better biomedical feature representations. Our final models for the NLI
    and RQE tasks achieve the 4th and 2nd rank on the shared-task leaderboard respectively.

  abstract: Official System Description paper of Team IIT-KGP ranked 1st in the Development
    phase and 3rd in Testing Phase in MEDIQA 2019 - Recognizing Question Entailment
    (RQE) Shared Task of BioNLP workshop - ACL 2019. The number of people turning
    to the Internet to search for a diverse range of health-related subjects continues
    to grow and with this multitude of information available, duplicate questions
    are becoming more frequent and finding the most appropriate answers becomes problematic.
    This issue is important for question answering platforms as it complicates the
    retrieval of all information relevant to the same topic, particularly when questions
    similar in essence are expressed differently, and answering a given medical question
    by retrieving similar questions that are already answered by human experts seems
    to be a promising solution. In this paper, we present our novel approach to detect
    question entailment by determining the type of question asked rather than focusing
    on the type of the ailment given. This unique methodology makes the approach robust
    towards examples which have different ailment names but are synonyms of each other.
    Also, it enables us to check entailment at a much more fine-grained level. QSpider
    is a staged system consisting of state-of-the-art model Sci-BERT used as a multi-class
    classifier aimed at capturing both question types and semantic relations stacked
    with a Gradient Boosting Classifier which checks for entailment. QSpider achieves
    an accuracy score of 68.4% on the Test set which outperforms the baseline model
    (54.1%) by an accuracy score of 14.3%.

  abstract: "We report on our system for textual inference and question entailment\
    \ in the medical domain for the ACL BioNLP 2019 Shared Task, MEDIQA. Textual inference\
    \ is the task of finding the semantic relationships between pairs of text. Question\
    \ entailment involves identifying pairs of questions which have similar semantic\
    \ content. To improve upon medical natural language inference and question entailment\
    \ approaches to further medical question answering, we propose a system that incorporates\
    \ open-domain and biomedical domain approaches to improve semantic understanding\
    \ and ambiguity resolution. Our models achieve 80% accuracy on medical natural\
    \ language inference (6.5% absolute improvement over the original baseline), 48.9%\
    \ accuracy on recognising medical question entailment, 0.248 Spearman\u2019s rho\
    \ for question answering ranking and 68.6% accuracy for question answering classification."

    in tasks 1 and 2 and our best runs achieved a performance accuracy of 0.852 and
    0.584 respectively for the test sets. The models proposed for task 1 relied on

  abstract: 'Recent advances in distributed language modeling have led to large performance
    increases on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it
    is not well understood how these methods may be augmented by knowledge-based approaches.
    This paper compares the performance and internal representation of an Enhanced
    Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) between three experimental conditions based
    on the representation method: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
    (BERT), Embeddings of Semantic Predications (ESP), or Cui2Vec. The methods were
    evaluated on the Medical Natural Language Inference (MedNLI) subtask of the MEDIQA
    2019 shared task. This task relied heavily on semantic understanding and thus
    served as a suitable evaluation set for the comparison of these representation
    methods.'

    two sentences as entailment, contradiction or neutrality. MedNLI is a biomedical
    flavour of NLI for clinical domain. This paper explores the use of Bidirectional
    Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) for solving MedNLI. The proposed
    model, BERT pre-trained on PMC, PubMed and fine-tuned on MIMICIII v1.4, achieves
    state of the art results on MedNLI (83.45%) and an accuracy of 78.5% in MEDIQA
    challenge. The authors present an analysis of the attention patterns that emerged
    as a result of training BERT on MedNLI using a visualization tool, bertviz.

    in all the three tasks defined in this particular shared task. The tasks are viz.
    i. Natural Language Inference (NLI) ii. Recognizing Question Entailment(RQE) and
    their application in medical Question Answering (QA). We submitted runs using
    multiple deep learning based systems (runs) for each of these three tasks. We
    submitted five system results in each of the NLI and RQE tasks, and four system
    results for the QA task. The systems yield encouraging results in all the three
    tasks. The highest performance obtained in NLI, RQE and QA tasks are 81.8%, 53.2%,
    and 71.7%, respectively.

  abstract: In this paper, we present three approaches for Natural Language Inference,
    Question Entailment Recognition and Question-Answering to improve domain-specific
    Information Retrieval. For addressing the NLI task, the UMLS Metathesaurus was
    used to find the synonyms of medical terms in given sentences, on which the InferSent
    model was trained to predict if the given sentence is an entailment, contradictory
    or neutral. We also introduce a new Extreme gradient boosting model built on PubMed
    embeddings to perform RQE. Further, a closed-domain Question Answering technique
    that uses Bi-directional LSTMs trained on the SquAD dataset to determine relevant
    ranks of answers for a given question is also discussed.

  abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) feature prominently in the mental lexicon
    of native speakers (Jackendoff, 1997) in all languages and domains, from informal
    to technical contexts (Biber et al., 1999) with about four MWEs being produced
    per minute of discourse (Glucksberg, 1989). MWEs come in all shapes and forms,
    including idioms like rock the boat (as cause problems or disturb a situation)
    and compound nouns like monkey business (as dishonest behaviour). Their accurate
    detection and understanding may often require more than knowledge about individual
    words and how they can be combined (Fillmore, 1979), as they may display various
    degrees of idiosyncrasy, including lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical
    (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010), which provide new challenges and opportunities
    for language processing (Constant et al., 2017). For instance, while for some
    combinations the meaning can be inferred from their parts like olive oil (oil
    made of olives) this is not always the case, as in dark horse (meaning an unknown
    candidate who unexpectedly succeeds), and when processing a sentence some of the
    challenges are to identify which words form an expression (Ramisch, 2015), and
    whether the expression is idiomatic (Cordeiro et al., 2019). In this talk I will
    give an overview of advances on the identification and treatment of multiword
    expressions, in particular concentrating on techniques for identifying their degree
    of idiomaticity.

  abstract: In this paper we focus on verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) in Bulgarian
    and Romanian as reflected in the wordnets of the two languages. The annotation
    of VMWEs relies on the classification defined within the PARSEME Cost Action.
    After outlining the properties of various types of VMWEs, a cross-language comparison
    is drawn, aimed to highlight the similarities and the differences between Bulgarian
    and Romanian with respect to the lexicalization and distribution of VMWEs. The
    contribution of this work is in outlining essential features of the description
    and classification of VMWEs and the cross-language comparison at the lexical level,
    which is essential for the understanding of the need for uniform annotation guidelines
    and a viable procedure for validation of the annotation.

  abstract: This paper reports on the Romanian journalistic corpus annotated with
    verbal multiword expressions following the PARSEME guidelines. The corpus is sentence
    split, tokenized, part-of-speech tagged, lemmatized, syntactically annotated and
    verbal multiword expressions are identified and classified. It offers insights
    into the frequency of such Romanian word combinations and allows for their characterization.
    We offer data about the types of verbal multiword expressions in the corpus and
    some of their characteristics, such as internal structure, diversity in the corpus,
    average length, productivity of the verbs. This is a language resource that is
    important per se, as well as for the task of automatic multiword expressions identification,
    which can be further used in other systems. It was already used as training and
    test material in the shared tasks for the automatic identification of verbal multiword
    expressions organized by PARSEME.

  abstract: We describe work consisting in porting two large German lexical resources
    into the OntoLex-Lemon model in order to establish complementary interlinkings
    between them. One resource is OdeNet (Open German WordNet) and the other is a
    further development of the German version of the MMORPH morphological analyzer.
    We show how the Multiword Expressions (MWEs) contained in OdeNet can be morphologically
    specified by the use of the lexical representation and linking features of OntoLex-Lemon,
    which also support the formulation of restrictions in the usage of such expressions.

  abstract: We introduce temporally and contextually-aware models for the novel task
    of predicting unseen but plausible concepts, as conveyed by noun-noun compounds
    in a time-stamped corpus. We train compositional models on observed compounds,
    more specifically the composed distributed representations of their constituents
    across a time-stamped corpus, while giving it corrupted instances (where head
    or modifier are replaced by a random constituent) as negative evidence. The model
    captures generalisations over this data and learns what combinations give rise
    to plausible compounds and which ones do not. After training, we query the model
    for the plausibility of automatically generated novel combinations and verify
    whether the classifications are accurate. For our best model, we find that in
    around 85% of the cases, the novel compounds generated are attested in previously
    unseen data. An additional estimated 5% are plausible despite not being attested
    in the recent corpus, based on judgments from independent human raters.

  abstract: This article describes a dependency-based strategy that uses compositional
    distributional semantics and cross-lingual word embeddings to translate multiword
    expressions (MWEs). Our unsupervised approach performs translation as a process
    of word contextualization by taking into account lexico-syntactic contexts and
    selectional preferences. This strategy is suited to translate phraseological combinations
    and phrases whose constituent words are lexically restricted by each other. Several
    experiments in adjective-noun and verb-object compounds show that mutual contextualization
    (co-compositionality) clearly outperforms other compositional methods. The paper
    also contributes with a new freely available dataset of English-Spanish MWEs used
    to validate the proposed compositional strategy.

  abstract: This paper presents an exploration of different statistical association
    measures to automatically identify collocations from corpora in English, Portuguese,
    and Spanish. To evaluate the impact of the association metrics we manually annotated
    corpora with three different syntactic patterns of collocations (adjective-noun,
    verb-object and nominal compounds). We took advantage of the PARSEME 1.1 Shared
    Task corpora by selecting a subset of 155k tokens in the three referred languages,
    in which we annotated 1,526 collocations with the corresponding Lexical Functions
    according to the Meaning-Text Theory. Using the resulting gold-standard, we have
    carried out a comparison between frequency data and several well-known association
    measures, both symmetric and asymmetric. The results show that the combination
    of dependency triples with raw frequency information is as powerful as the best
    association measures in most syntactic patterns and languages. Furthermore, and
    despite the asymmetric behaviour of collocations, directional approaches perform
    worse than the symmetric ones in the extraction of these phraseological combinations.

  abstract: "A substantial body of research has demonstrated that native speakers\
    \ are sensitive to the frequencies of multiword sequences (MWS). Here, we ask\
    \ whether and to what extent intermediate-advanced L2 speakers of English can\
    \ also develop the sensitivity to the statistics of MWS. To this end, we aimed\
    \ to replicate the MWS frequency effects found for adult native language speakers\
    \ based on evidence from self-paced reading and sentence recall tasks in an ecologically\
    \ more valid eye-tracking study. L2 speakers\u2019 sensitivity to MWS frequency\
    \ was evaluated using generalized linear mixed-effects regression with separate\
    \ models fitted for each of the four dependent measures. Mixed-effects modeling\
    \ revealed significantly faster processing of sentences containing MWS compared\
    \ to sentences containing equivalent control items across all eyetracking measures.\
    \ Taken together, these findings suggest that, in line with emergentist approaches,\
    \ MWS are important building blocks of language and that similar mechanisms underlie\

  abstract: "Because most multiword expressions (MWEs), especially verbal ones, are\
    \ semantically non-compositional, their automatic identification in running text\
    \ is a prerequisite for semantically-oriented downstream applications. However,\
    \ recent developments, driven notably by the PARSEME shared task on automatic\
    \ identification of verbal MWEs, show that this task is harder than related tasks,\
    \ despite recent contributions both in multilingual corpus annotation and in computational\
    \ models. In this paper, we analyse possible reasons for this state of affairs.\
    \ They lie in the nature of the MWE phenomenon, as well as in its distributional\
    \ properties. We also offer a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art systems,\
    \ which exhibit particularly strong sensitivity to unseen data. On this basis,\
    \ we claim that, in order to make strong headway in MWE identification, the community\
    \ should bend its mind into coupling identification of MWEs with their discovery,\
    \ via syntactic MWE lexicons. Such lexicons need not necessarily achieve a linguistically\
    \ complete modelling of MWEs\u2019 behavior, but they should provide minimal morphosyntactic\
    \ information to cover some potential uses, so as to complement existing MWE-annotated\
    \ corpora. We define requirements for such minimal NLP-oriented lexicon, and we\
    \ propose a roadmap for the MWE community driven by these requirements."

  abstract: Building meaningful representations of noun compounds is not trivial since
    many of them scarcely appear in the corpus. To that end, composition functions
    approximate the distributional representation of a noun compound by combining
    its constituent distributional vectors. In the more general case, phrase embeddings
    have been trained by minimizing the distance between the vectors representing
    paraphrases. We compare various types of noun compound representations, including
    distributional, compositional, and paraphrase-based representations, through a
    series of tasks and analyses, and with an extensive number of underlying word
    embeddings. We find that indeed, in most cases, composition functions produce
    higher quality representations than distributional ones, and they improve with
    computational power. No single function performs best in all scenarios, suggesting
    that a joint training objective may produce improved representations.

  abstract: "In this paper we argue that Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) provides\
    \ a good framework for semantic modelling of adjective-noun collocations. More\
    \ specifically, the notion of a frame is rich enough to account for nouns from\
    \ different semantic classes and to model semantic relations that hold between\
    \ an adjective and a noun in terms of Frame Elements. We have substantiated these\
    \ findings by considering a sample of adjective-noun collocations from German\
    \ such as \u201Cenger Freund\u201D \u2018close friend\u2019 and \u201Cstarker\
    \ Regen\u201D \u2018heavy rain\u2019. The data sample is taken from different\
    \ semantic fields identified in the German wordnet GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg,\
    \ 1997; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010). The study is based on the electronic dictionary\
    \ DWDS (Klein and Geyken, 2010) and uses the collocation extraction tool Wortprofil\
    \ (Geyken et al., 2009). The FrameNet modelling is based on the online resource\
    \ available at http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu. Since FrameNets are available\
    \ for a range of typologically different languages, it is feasible to extend the\
    \ current case study to other languages."

  abstract: We propose to tackle the problem of verbal multiword expression (VMWE)
    identification using a neural graph parsing-based approach. Our solution involves
    encoding VMWE annotations as labellings of dependency trees and, subsequently,
    applying a neural network to model the probabilities of different labellings.
    This strategy can be particularly effective when applied to discontinuous VMWEs
    and, thanks to dense, pre-trained word vector representations, VMWEs unseen during
    training. Evaluation of our approach on three PARSEME datasets (German, French,
    and Polish) shows that it allows to achieve performance on par with the previous
    state-of-the-art (Al Saied et al., 2018).

  abstract: "An idiom is defined as a non-compositional multiword expression, one\
    \ whose meaning cannot be deduced from the definitions of the component words.\
    \ This definition does not explicitly define the compositionality of an idiom\u2019\
    s sentiment; this paper aims to determine whether the sentiment of the component\
    \ words of an idiom is related to the sentiment of that idiom. We use the Dictionary\
    \ of Affect in Language augmented by WordNet to give each idiom in the Sentiment\
    \ Lexicon of IDiomatic Expressions (SLIDE) a component-wise sentiment score and\
    \ compare it to the phrase-level sentiment label crowdsourced by the creators\
    \ of SLIDE. We find that there is no discernible relation between these two measures\
    \ of idiom sentiment. This supports the hypothesis that idioms are not compositional\
    \ for sentiment along with semantics and motivates further work in handling idioms\
    \ for sentiment analysis."

  abstract: We report on the ongoing development of IDION, a web resource of richly
    documented multiword expressions (MWEs) of Modern Greek addressed to the human
    user and to NLP. IDION contains about 2000 verb MWEs (VMWEs) of which about 850
    are fully documented as regards their syntactic flexibility, their semantics and
    the semantic relations with other VMWEs. Sets of synonymous MWEs are defined in
    a bottom-up manner revealing the conceptual organization of the MG VMWE domain.

  abstract: Neologism detection is a key task in the constructing of lexical resources
    and has wider implications for NLP, however the identification of multiword neologisms
    has received little attention. In this paper, we show that we can effectively
    identify the distinction between compositional and non-compositional adjective-noun
    pairs by using pretrained language models and comparing this with individual word
    embeddings. Our results show that the use of these models significantly improves
    over baseline linguistic features, however the combination with linguistic features
    still further improves the results, suggesting the strength of a hybrid approach.

  abstract: This article focuses on the lemmatization of multiword expressions (MWEs).
    We propose a deep encoder-decoder architecture generating for every MWE word its
    corresponding part in the lemma, based on the internal context of the MWE. The
    encoder relies on recurrent networks based on (1) the character sequence of the
    individual words to capture their morphological properties, and (2) the word sequence
    of the MWE to capture lexical and syntactic properties. The decoder in charge
    of generating the corresponding part of the lemma for each word of the MWE is
    based on a classical character-level attention-based recurrent model. Our model
    is evaluated for Italian, French, Polish and Portuguese and shows good performances
    except for Polish.

  abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) extracts terminology from domain-specific
    corpora. ATE is used in many NLP tasks, including Computer Assisted Translation,
    where it is typically applied to individual documents rather than the entire corpus.
    While corpus-level ATE has been extensively evaluated, it is not obvious how the
    results transfer to document-level ATE. To fill this gap, we evaluate 16 state-of-the-art
    ATE methods on full-length documents from three different domains, on both corpus
    and document levels. Unlike existing studies, our evaluation is more realistic
    as we take into account all gold terms. We show that no single method is best
    in corpus-level ATE, but C-Value and KeyConceptRelatendess surpass others in document-level
    ATE.

  abstract: 'Recent developments in deep learning have prompted a surge of interest
    in the application of multitask and transfer learning to NLP problems. In this
    study, we explore for the first time, the application of transfer learning (TRL)
    and multitask learning (MTL) to the identification of Multiword Expressions (MWEs).
    For MTL, we exploit the shared syntactic information between MWE and dependency
    parsing models to jointly train a single model on both tasks. We specifically
    predict two types of labels: MWE and dependency parse. Our neural MTL architecture
    utilises the supervision of dependency parsing in lower layers and predicts MWE
    tags in upper layers. In the TRL scenario, we overcome the scarcity of data by
    learning a model on a larger MWE dataset and transferring the knowledge to a resource-poor
    setting in another language. In both scenarios, the resulting models achieved
    higher performance compared to standard neural approaches.'

  abstract: 'Recent initiatives such as the PARSEME shared task allowed the rapid
    development of MWE identification systems. Many of those are based on recent NLP
    advances, using neural sequence models that take continuous word representations
    as input. We study two related questions in neural MWE identification: (a) the
    use of lemmas and/or surface forms as input features, and (b) the use of word-based
    or character-based embeddings to represent them. Our experiments on Basque, French,
    and Polish show that character-based representations yield systematically better
    results than word-based ones. In some cases, character-based representations of
    surface forms can be used as a proxy for lemmas, depending on the morphological
    complexity of the language.'

  abstract: Despite their original goal to jointly learn to align and translate, Neural
    Machine Translation (NMT) models, especially Transformer, are often perceived
    as not learning interpretable word alignments. In this paper, we show that NMT
    models do learn interpretable word alignments, which could only be revealed with
    proper interpretation methods. We propose a series of such methods that are model-agnostic,
    are able to be applied either offline or online, and do not require parameter
    update or architectural change. We show that under the force decoding setup, the
    alignments induced by our interpretation method are of better quality than fast-align
    for some systems, and when performing free decoding, they agree well with the
    alignments induced by automatic alignment tools.

  abstract: An important concern in training multilingual neural machine translation
    (NMT) is to translate between language pairs unseen during training, i.e zero-shot
    translation. Improving this ability kills two birds with one stone by providing
    an alternative to pivot translation which also allows us to better understand
    how the model captures information between languages. In this work, we carried
    out an investigation on this capability of the multilingual NMT models. First,
    we intentionally create an encoder architecture which is independent with respect
    to the source language. Such experiments shed light on the ability of NMT encoders
    to learn multilingual representations, in general. Based on such proof of concept,
    we were able to design regularization methods into the standard Transformer model,
    so that the whole architecture becomes more robust in zero-shot conditions. We
    investigated the behaviour of such models on the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual
    dataset. We achieved an average improvement of 2.23 BLEU points across 12 language
    pairs compared to the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art multilingual
    system. Additionally, we carry out further experiments in which the effect is
    confirmed even for language pairs with multiple intermediate pivots.

  abstract: 'Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) has recently achieved
    state-of-the-art performance on many machine translation tasks. However, recent
    work (Raganato and Tiedemann, 2018; Tang et al., 2018; Tran et al., 2018) has
    indicated that Transformer models may not learn syntactic structures as well as
    their recurrent neural network-based counterparts, particularly in low-resource
    cases. In this paper, we incorporate constituency parse information into a Transformer
    NMT model. We leverage linearized parses of the source training sentences in order
    to inject syntax into the Transformer architecture without modifying it. We introduce
    two methods: a multi-task machine translation and parsing model with a single
    encoder and decoder, and a mixed encoder model that learns to translate directly
    from parsed and unparsed source sentences. We evaluate our methods on low-resource
    translation from English into twenty target languages, showing consistent improvements
    of 1.3 BLEU on average across diverse target languages for the multi-task technique.
    We further evaluate the models on full-scale WMT tasks, finding that the multi-task
    model aids low- and medium-resource NMT but degenerates high-resource English-German
    translation.'

  abstract: "In this work, we train an Automatic Post-Editing (APE) model and use\
    \ it to reveal biases in standard MT evaluation procedures. The goal of our APE\
    \ model is to correct typical errors introduced by the translation process, and\
    \ convert the \u201Ctranslationese\u201D output into natural text. Our APE model\
    \ is trained entirely on monolingual data that has been round-trip translated\
    \ through English, to mimic errors that are similar to the ones introduced by\
    \ NMT. We apply our model to the output of existing NMT systems, and demonstrate\
    \ that, while the human-judged quality improves in all cases, BLEU scores drop\
    \ with forward-translated test sets. We verify these results for the WMT18 English\
    \ to German, WMT15 English to French, and WMT16 English to Romanian tasks. Furthermore,\
    \ we selectively apply our APE model on the output of the top submissions of the\
    \ most recent WMT evaluation campaigns. We see quality improvements on all tasks\
    \ of up to 2.5 BLEU points."

  abstract: "Back-translation \u2014 data augmentation by translating target monolingual\
    \ data \u2014 is a crucial component in modern neural machine translation (NMT).\
    \ In this work, we reformulate back-translation in the scope of cross-entropy\
    \ optimization of an NMT model, clarifying its underlying mathematical assumptions\
    \ and approximations beyond its heuristic usage. Our formulation covers broader\
    \ synthetic data generation schemes, including sampling from a target-to-source\
    \ NMT model. With this formulation, we point out fundamental problems of the sampling-based\
    \ approaches and propose to remedy them by (i) disabling label smoothing for the\
    \ target-to-source model and (ii) sampling from a restricted search space. Our\
    \ statements are investigated on the WMT 2018 German <-> English news translation\

  abstract: Recent work in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown significant
    quality gains from noised-beam decoding during back-translation, a method to generate
    synthetic parallel data. We show that the main role of such synthetic noise is
    not to diversify the source side, as previously suggested, but simply to indicate
    to the model that the given source is synthetic. We propose a simpler alternative
    to noising techniques, consisting of tagging back-translated source sentences
    with an extra token. Our results on WMT outperform noised back-translation in
    English-Romanian and match performance on English-German, redefining the state-of-the-art
    on the former.

  abstract: 'We explore using multilingual document embeddings for nearest neighbor
    mining of parallel data. Three document-level representations are investigated:
    (i) document embeddings generated by simply averaging multilingual sentence embeddings;
    (ii) a neural bag-of-words (BoW) document encoding model; (iii) a hierarchical
    multilingual document encoder (HiDE) that builds on our sentence-level model.
    The results show document embeddings derived from sentence-level averaging are
    surprisingly effective for clean datasets, but suggest models trained hierarchically
    at the document-level are more effective on noisy data. Analysis experiments demonstrate
    our hierarchical models are very robust to variations in the underlying sentence
    embedding quality. Using document embeddings trained with HiDE achieves the state-of-the-art
    on United Nations (UN) parallel document mining, 94.9% P@1 for en-fr and 97.3%
    P@1 for en-es.'

  abstract: In this work, we customized a neural machine translation system for translation
    of subtitles in the domain of entertainment. The neural translation model was
    adapted to the subtitling content and style and extended by a simple, yet effective
    technique for utilizing inter-sentence context for short sentences such as dialog
    turns. The main contribution of the paper is a novel subtitle segmentation algorithm
    that predicts the end of a subtitle line given the previous word-level context
    using a recurrent neural network learned from human segmentation decisions. This
    model is combined with subtitle length and duration constraints established in
    the subtitling industry. We conducted a thorough human evaluation with two post-editors
    (English-to-Spanish translation of a documentary and a sitcom). It showed a notable
    productivity increase of up to 37% as compared to translating from scratch and
    significant reductions in human translation edit rate in comparison with the post-editing
    of the baseline non-adapted system without a learned segmentation model.

    \ conflict between a translation\u2019s meaning preservation and \u2018dubbability\u2019\
    \ and the resulting trade-off can be controlled by weighing the synchrony constraints.\
    \ We introduce our work, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its\
    \ kind, on integrating synchrony constraints into the machine translation paradigm.\
    \ We present first results for the integration of synchrony constraints into encoder\
    \ decoder-based neural machine translation and show that considerably more \u2018\
    dubbable\u2019 translations can be achieved with only a small impact on BLEU score,\
    \ and dubbability improves more steeply than BLEU degrades."

  abstract: "The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses\
    \ attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn\
    \ from the surrounding context. Lexical features are fed into the first layer\
    \ and propagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need\
    \ to represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model\u2019\
    s capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.\
    \ To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between\
    \ the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.\
    \ This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without\
    \ expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show\
    \ that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline\
    \ transformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9\
    \ BLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along\
    \ the hidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical\
    \ connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments\
    \ exploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior."

  abstract: "This paper presents a high-quality multilingual dataset for the documentation\
    \ domain to advance research on localization of structured text. Unlike widely-used\
    \ datasets for translation of plain text, we collect XML-structured parallel text\
    \ segments from the online documentation for an enterprise software platform.\
    \ These Web pages have been professionally translated from English into 16 languages\
    \ and maintained by domain experts, and around 100,000 text segments are available\
    \ for each language pair. We build and evaluate translation models for seven target\
    \ languages from English, with several different copy mechanisms and an XML-constrained\
    \ beam search. We also experiment with a non-English pair to show that our dataset\
    \ has the potential to explicitly enable 17 \xD7 16 translation settings. Our\
    \ experiments show that learning to translate with the XML tags improves translation\
    \ accuracy, and the beam search accurately generates XML structures. We also discuss\
    \ trade-offs of using the copy mechanisms by focusing on translation of numerical\
    \ words and named entities. We further provide a detailed human analysis of gaps\
    \ between the model output and human translations for real-world applications,\
    \ including suitability for post-editing."

  abstract: This paper presents the results of the premier shared task organized alongside
    the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2019. Participants were asked to build
    machine translation systems for any of 18 language pairs, to be evaluated on a
    test set of news stories. The main metric for this task is human judgment of translation
    quality. The task was also opened up to additional test suites to probe specific
    aspects of translation.

    \ 3 reimplementations (chrF+, sacreBLEU-BLEU, and sacreBLEU-chrF). Metrics were\

  abstract: "We share the findings of the first shared task on improving robustness\
    \ of Machine Translation (MT). The task provides a testbed representing challenges\
    \ facing MT models deployed in the real world, and facilitates new approaches\
    \ to improve models\u2019 robustness to noisy input and domain mismatch. We focus\
    \ on two language pairs (English-French and English-Japanese), and the submitted\
    \ systems are evaluated on a blind test set consisting of noisy comments on Reddit\
    \ and professionally sourced translations. As a new task, we received 23 submissions\
    \ by 11 participating teams from universities, companies, national labs, etc.\
    \ All submitted systems achieved large improvements over baselines, with the best\
    \ improvement having +22.33 BLEU. We evaluated submissions by both human judgment\
    \ and automatic evaluation (BLEU), which shows high correlations (Pearson\u2019\
    s r = 0.94 and 0.95). Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the\
    \ submitted systems using compare-mt, which revealed their salient differences\
    \ in handling challenges in this task. Such analysis provides additional insights\
    \ when there is occasional disagreement between human judgment and BLEU, e.g.\
    \ systems better at producing colloquial expressions received higher score from\
    \ human judgment."

  abstract: We build parfda Moses statistical machine translation (SMT) models for
    most language pairs in the news translation task. We experiment with a hybrid
    approach using neural language models integrated into Moses. We obtain the constrained
    data statistics on the machine translation task, the coverage of the test sets,
    and the upper bounds on the translation results. We also contribute a new testsuite
    for the German-English language pair and a new automated key phrase extraction
    technique for the evaluation of the testsuite translations.

  abstract: This paper presents the participation of DBMS-KU Interpolation system
    in WMT19 shared task, namely, Kazakh-English language pair. We examine the use
    of interpolation method using a different language model order. Our Interpolation
    system combines a direct translation with Russian as a pivot language. We use
    3-gram and 5-gram language model orders to perform the language translation in
    this work. To reduce noise in the pivot translation process, we prune the phrase
    table of source-pivot and pivot-target. Our experimental results show that our
    Interpolation system outperforms the Baseline in terms of BLEU-cased score by
    +0.5 and +0.1 points in Kazakh-English and English-Kazakh, respectively. In particular,
    using the 5-gram language model order in our system could obtain better BLEU-cased
    score than utilizing the 3-gram one. Interestingly, we found that by employing
    the Interpolation system could reduce the perplexity score of English-Kazakh when
    using 3-gram language model order.

    in the WMT19 news translation shared task for Kazakh-English. Given the low amount
    of parallel training data, we resort to using Russian as pivot language, training
    subword-based statistical translation systems for Russian-Kazakh and Russian-English
    that were then used to create two synthetic pseudo-parallel corpora for Kazakh-English
    and English-Kazakh respectively. Finally, a self-attention model based on the
    decoder part of the Transformer architecture was trained on the two pseudo-parallel
    corpora.

    \ BPE, back translation, multi-features data selection, data augmentation, greedy\

    \ we propose a novel augmentation method Cycle Translation and a data mixture\
    \ strategy Big/Small parallel construction to entirely exploit the synthetic corpus.\
    \ Extensive experiments show that adding the above techniques can make continuous\

  abstract: We study several methods for full or partial sharing of the decoder parameters
    of multi-lingual NMT models. Using only the WMT 2019 shared task parallel datasets
    for training, we evaluate both fully supervised and zero-shot translation performance
    in 110 unique translation directions. We use additional test sets and re-purpose
    evaluation methods recently used for unsupervised MT in order to evaluate zero-shot
    translation performance for language pairs where no gold-standard parallel data
    is available. To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of multi-lingual
    translation yet conducted in terms of the total size of the training data we use,
    and in terms of the number of zero-shot translation pairs we evaluate. We conduct
    an in-depth evaluation of the translation performance of different models, highlighting
    the trade-offs between methods of sharing decoder parameters. We find that models
    which have task-specific decoder parameters outperform models where decoder parameters
    are fully shared across all tasks.

  abstract: This paper describes the Microsoft Translator submissions to the WMT19
    news translation shared task for English-German. Our main focus is document-level
    neural machine translation with deep transformer models. We start with strong
    sentence-level baselines, trained on large-scale data created via data-filtering
    and noisy back-translation and find that back-translation seems to mainly help
    with translationese input. We explore fine-tuning techniques, deeper models and
    different ensembling strategies to counter these effects. Using document boundaries
    present in the authentic and synthetic parallel data, we create sequences of up
    to 1000 subword segments and train transformer translation models. We experiment
    with data augmentation techniques for the smaller authentic data with document-boundaries
    and for larger authentic data without boundaries. We further explore multi-task
    training for the incorporation of document-level source language monolingual data
    via the BERT-objective on the encoder and two-pass decoding for combinations of
    sentence-level and document-level systems. Based on preliminary human evaluation
    results, evaluators strongly prefer the document-level systems over our comparable
    sentence-level system. The document-level systems also seem to score higher than
    the human references in source-based direct assessment.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the CUNI translation system used for the unsupervised
    news shared task of the ACL 2019 Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19).
    We follow the strategy of Artetxe ae at. (2018b), creating a seed phrase-based
    system where the phrase table is initialized from cross-lingual embedding mappings
    trained on monolingual data, followed by a neural machine translation system trained
    on synthetic parallel data. The synthetic corpus was produced from a monolingual
    corpus by a tuned PBMT model refined through iterative back-translation. We further
    focus on the handling of named entities, i.e. the part of vocabulary where the
    cross-lingual embedding mapping suffers most. Our system reaches a BLEU score
    of 15.3 on the German-Czech WMT19 shared task.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission to the WMT 2019 Chinese-English (zh-en)
    news translation shared task. Our systems are based on RNN architectures with
    pre-trained embeddings which utilize character and sub-character information.
    We compare models with these different granularity levels using different evaluating
    metics. We find that a finer granularity embeddings can help the model according
    to character level evaluation and that the pre-trained embeddings can also be
    beneficial for model performance marginally when the training data is limited.

  abstract: We describe the neural machine translation (NMT) system developed at the
    National Research Council of Canada (NRC) for the Kazakh-English news translation
    task of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19). Our submission is
    a multi-source NMT taking both the original Kazakh sentence and its Russian translation
    as input for translating into English.

  abstract: "This paper describes CAiRE\u2019s submission to the unsupervised machine\
    \ translation track of the WMT\u201919 news shared task from German to Czech.\
    \ We leverage a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model and\
    \ a pre-trained language model to combine word-level neural machine translation\
    \ (NMT) and subword-level NMT models without using any parallel data. We propose\
    \ to solve the morphological richness problem of languages by training byte-pair\
    \ encoding (BPE) embeddings for German and Czech separately, and they are aligned\
    \ using MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018). To ensure the fluency and consistency of\
    \ translations, a rescoring mechanism is proposed that reuses the pre-trained\
    \ language model to select the translation candidates generated through beam search.\
    \ Moreover, a series of pre-processing and post-processing approaches are applied\
    \ to improve the quality of final translations."

  abstract: In the current work, we present a description of the system submitted
    to WMT 2019 News Translation Shared task. The system was created to translate
    news text from Lithuanian to English. To accomplish the given task, our system
    used a Word Embedding based Neural Machine Translation model to post edit the
    outputs generated by a Statistical Machine Translation model. The current paper
    documents the architecture of our model, descriptions of the various modules and
    the results produced using the same. Our system garnered a BLEU score of 17.6.

  abstract: This paper describes the submissions of the eTranslation team to the WMT
    2019 news translation shared task. The systems have been developed with the aim
    of identifying and following rather than establishing best practices, under the
    constraints imposed by a low resource training and decoding environment normally
    used for our production systems. Thus most of the findings and results are transferable
    to systems used in the eTranslation service. Evaluations suggest that this approach
    is able to produce decent models with good performance and speed without the overhead
    of using prohibitively deep and complex architectures.

    \ source and target. Instead of translating each sentence independently, we split\
    \ the document into possibly overlapping multi-sentence segments. In case of the\

    \ a +0.6 BLEU improvement (p < 0.05) relative to the same system applied on isolated\
    \ sentences. To assess the potential effect document-level models might have on\

    \ For all tasks, the final submitted system is based on the Transformer architecture.\
    \ We focus on improving data filtering and fine-tuning as well as systematically\
    \ evaluating interesting approaches like unigram language model segmentation and\
    \ transfer learning. For the De-En task, none of the tested methods gave a significant\
    \ improvement over last years winning system and we end up with the same performance,\
    \ resulting in 39.6% BLEU on newstest2019. In the Zh-En task, we show 1.3% BLEU\
    \ improvement over our last year\u2019s submission, which we mostly attribute\
    \ to the splitting of long sentences during translation. We further report results\
    \ on the Kazakh-English task where we gain improvements of 11.1% BLEU over our\
    \ baseline system. On the same task we present a recent transfer learning approach,\
    \ which uses half of the free parameters of our submission system and performs\
    \ on par with it."

  abstract: In this paper we introduce the systems Baidu submitted for the WMT19 shared
    task on Chinese<->English news translation. Our systems are based on the Transformer
    architecture with some effective improvements. Data selection, back translation,
    data augmentation, knowledge distillation, domain adaptation, model ensemble and
    re-ranking are employed and proven effective in our experiments. Our Chinese->English
    system achieved the highest case-sensitive BLEU score among all constrained submissions,
    and our English->Chinese system ranked the second in all submissions.

  abstract: "We describe LMU Munich\u2019s machine translation system for English\u2192\
    German translation which was used to participate in the WMT19 shared task on supervised\
    \ news translation. We specifically participated in the document-level MT track.\
    \ The system used as a primary submission is a context-aware Transformer capable\
    \ of both rich modeling of limited contextual information and integration of large-scale\
    \ document-level context with a less rich representation. We train this model\
    \ by fine-tuning a big Transformer baseline. Our experimental results show that\
    \ document-level context provides for large improvements in translation quality,\
    \ and adding a rich representation of the previous sentence provides a small additional\
    \ gain."

    in much smaller and cleaner training sets. For English-German we trained both
    sentence-level transformer models as well as compared different document-level

  abstract: Machine translation is one of the most popular areas in natural language
    processing. WMT is a conference to assess the level of machine translation capabilities
    of organizations around the world, which is the evaluation activity we participated
    in. In this review we participated in a two-way translation track from Russian
    to English and English to Russian. We used official training data, 38 million
    parallel corpora, and 10 million monolingual corpora. The overall framework we
    use is the Transformer neural machine translation model, supplemented by data
    filtering, post-processing, reordering and other related processing methods. The
    BLEU value of our final translation result from Russian to English is 38.7, ranking
    5th, while from English to Russian is 27.8, ranking 10th.

  abstract: We present the results of the application of a grammatical test suite
    for German-to-English MT on the systems submitted at WMT19, with a detailed analysis
    for 107 phenomena organized in 14 categories. The systems still translate wrong
    one out of four test items in average. Low performance is indicated for idioms,
    modals, pseudo-clefts, multi-word expressions and verb valency. When compared
    to last year, there has been a improvement of function words, non verbal agreement
    and punctuation. More detailed conclusions about particular systems and phenomena
    are also presented.

  abstract: As the quality of machine translation rises and neural machine translation
    (NMT) is moving from sentence to document level translations, it is becoming increasingly
    difficult to evaluate the output of translation systems. We provide a test suite
    for WMT19 aimed at assessing discourse phenomena of MT systems participating in
    the News Translation Task. We have manually checked the outputs and identified
    types of translation errors that are relevant to document-level translation.

  abstract: "We present a test set for evaluating an MT system\u2019s capability to\
    \ translate ambiguous conjunctions depending on the sentence structure. We concentrate\
    \ on the English conjunction \u201Cbut\u201D and its French equivalent \u201C\
    mais\u201D which can be translated into two different German conjunctions. We\
    \ evaluate all English-to-German and French-to-German submissions to the WMT 2019\
    \ shared translation task. The evaluation is done mainly automatically, with additional\
    \ fast manual inspection of unclear cases. All systems almost perfectly recognise\
    \ the target conjunction \u201Caber\u201D, whereas accuracies for the other target\
    \ conjunction \u201Csondern\u201D range from 78% to 97%, and the errors are mostly\
    \ caused by replacing it with the alternative conjunction \u201Caber\u201D. The\
    \ best performing system for both language pairs is a multilingual Transformer\
    \ \u201CTartuNLP\u201D system trained on all WMT 2019 language pairs which use\
    \ the Latin script, indicating that the multilingual approach is beneficial for\
    \ conjunction disambiguation. As for other system features, such as using synthetic\
    \ back-translated data, context-aware, hybrid, etc., no particular (dis)advantages\
    \ can be observed. Qualitative manual inspection of translation hypotheses shown\
    \ that highly ranked systems generally produce translations with high adequacy\
    \ and fluency, meaning that these systems are not only capable of capturing the\
    \ right conjunction whereas the rest of the translation hypothesis is poor. On\
    \ the other hand, the low ranked systems generally exhibit lower fluency and poor\
    \ adequacy."

    of a correct translation is the ability to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD),
    i.e., to translate an ambiguous word with its correct sense. Existing evaluation
    benchmarks on WSD capabilities of translation systems rely heavily on manual work
    and cover only few language pairs and few word types. We present MuCoW, a multilingual
    contrastive test suite that covers 16 language pairs with more than 200 thousand
    contrastive sentence pairs, automatically built from word-aligned parallel corpora
    and the wide-coverage multilingual sense inventory of BabelNet. We evaluate the
    quality of the ambiguity lexicons and of the resulting test suite on all submissions
    from 9 language pairs presented in the WMT19 news shared translation task, plus
    on other 5 language pairs using NMT pretrained models. The MuCoW test suite is
    available at http://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/MuCoW.

    \ knowledge of the domain is necessary. For the naked eye of a non-expert, translations\
    \ by many systems seem almost perfect and automatic MT evaluation with one reference\
    \ is practically useless for considering these details. Furthermore, we show on\
    \ a sample document from the domain of agreements that even the best systems completely\

  abstract: This paper describes Meteor++ 2.0, our submission to the WMT19 Metric
    Shared Task. The well known Meteor metric improves machine translation evaluation
    by introducing paraphrase knowledge. However, it only focuses on the lexical level
    and utilizes consecutive n-grams paraphrases. In this work, we take into consideration
    syntactic level paraphrase knowledge, which sometimes may be skip-grams. We describe
    how such knowledge can be extracted from Paraphrase Database (PPDB) and integrated
    into Meteor-based metrics. Experiments on WMT15 and WMT17 evaluation datasets
    show that the newly proposed metric outperforms all previous versions of Meteor.

  abstract: Over the years a number of machine translation metrics have been developed
    in order to evaluate the accuracy and quality of machine-generated translations.
    Metrics such as BLEU and TER have been used for decades. However, with the rapid
    progress of machine translation systems, the need for better metrics is growing.
    This paper proposes an extension of the edit distance, which achieves better human
    correlation, whilst remaining fast, flexible and easy to understand.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce our participation in the WMT 2019 Metric Shared
    Task. We propose an improved version of sentence BLEU using filtered pseudo-references.
    We propose a method to filter pseudo-references by paraphrasing for automatic
    evaluation of machine translation (MT). We use the outputs of off-the-shelf MT
    systems as pseudo-references filtered by paraphrasing in addition to a single
    human reference (gold reference). We use BERT fine-tuned with paraphrase corpus
    to filter pseudo-references by checking the paraphrasability with the gold reference.
    Our experimental results of the WMT 2016 and 2017 datasets show that our method
    achieved higher correlation with human evaluation than the sentence BLEU (SentBLEU)
    baselines with a single reference and with unfiltered pseudo-references.

    is the Charles University (CUNI) Transformer system trained for the WMT18 shared
    task on News Translation. Quantitative results show that the CUNI Transformer
    system is already far more robust to noisy input than the LSTM-based baseline
    provided by the task organizers. We further improved the performance of our model
    by fine-tuning on the in-domain noisy data without influencing the translation
    quality on the news domain.

  abstract: "This paper describes NTT\u2019s submission to the WMT19 robustness task.\
    \ This task mainly focuses on translating noisy text (e.g., posts on Twitter),\
    \ which presents different difficulties from typical translation tasks such as\
    \ news. Our submission combined techniques including utilization of a synthetic\
    \ corpus, domain adaptation, and a placeholder mechanism, which significantly\
    \ improved over the previous baseline. Experimental results revealed the placeholder\
    \ mechanism, which temporarily replaces the non-standard tokens including emojis\
    \ and emoticons with special placeholder tokens during translation, improves translation\
    \ accuracy even with noisy texts."

  abstract: This paper describes the machine translation system developed jointly
    by Baidu Research and Oregon State University for WMT 2019 Machine Translation
    Robustness Shared Task. Translation of social media is a very challenging problem,
    since its style is very different from normal parallel corpora (e.g. News) and
    also include various types of noises. To make it worse, the amount of social media
    parallel corpora is extremely limited. In this paper, we use a domain sensitive
    training method which leverages a large amount of parallel data from popular domains
    together with a little amount of parallel data from social media. Furthermore,
    we generate a parallel dataset with pseudo noisy source sentences which are back-translated
    from monolingual data using a model trained by a similar domain sensitive way.
    In this way, we achieve more than 10 BLEU improvement in both En-Fr and Fr-En
    translation compared with the baseline methods.

  abstract: While neural machine translation (NMT) achieves remarkable performance
    on clean, in-domain text, performance is known to degrade drastically when facing
    text which is full of typos, grammatical errors and other varieties of noise.
    In this work, we propose a multi-task learning algorithm for transformer-based
    MT systems that is more resilient to this noise. We describe our submission to
    the WMT 2019 Robustness shared task based on this method. Our model achieves a
    BLEU score of 32.8 on the shared task French to English dataset, which is 7.1
    BLEU points higher than the baseline vanilla transformer trained with clean text.

    \ Keeping the same general evaluation setting of the previous four rounds, this\
    \ year we focused on two language pairs (English-German and English-Russian) and\
    \ on domain-specific data (In-formation Technology). For both the language directions,\

    \ participated in the English-German task, with a total of 18 submitted runs.\
    \ The evaluation, which was performed on the same test set used for the 2018 round,\
    \ shows a slight progress in APE technology: 4 teams achieved better results than\
    \ last year\u2019s winning system, with improvements up to -0.78 TER and +1.23\
    \ BLEU points over the baseline. Two teams participated in theEnglish-Russian\
    \ task submitting 2 runs each. On this new language direction, characterized by\
    \ a higher quality of the original translations, the task proved to be particularly\

  abstract: In the fourth edition of the WMT Biomedical Translation task, we considered
    a total of six languages, namely Chinese (zh), English (en), French (fr), German
    (de), Portuguese (pt), and Spanish (es). We performed an evaluation of automatic
    translations for a total of 10 language directions, namely, zh/en, en/zh, fr/en,
    en/fr, de/en, en/de, pt/en, en/pt, es/en, and en/es. We provided training data
    based on MEDLINE abstracts for eight of the 10 language pairs and test sets for
    all of them. In addition to that, we offered a new sub-task for the translation
    of terms in biomedical terminologies for the en/es language direction. Higher
    BLEU scores (close to 0.5) were obtained for the es/en, en/es and en/pt test sets,
    as well as for the terminology sub-task. After manual validation of the primary
    runs, some submissions were judged to be better than the reference translations,
    for instance, for de/en, en/es and es/en.

  abstract: Following the WMT 2018 Shared Task on Parallel Corpus Filtering, we posed
    the challenge of assigning sentence-level quality scores for very noisy corpora
    of sentence pairs crawled from the web, with the goal of sub-selecting 2% and
    10% of the highest-quality data to be used to train machine translation systems.
    This year, the task tackled the low resource condition of Nepali-English and Sinhala-English.
    Eleven participants from companies, national research labs, and universities participated
    in this task.

  abstract: We obtain new results using referential translation machines with increased
    number of learning models in the set of results that are stacked to obtain a better
    mixture of experts prediction. We combine features extracted from the word-level
    predictions with the sentence- or document-level features, which significantly
    improve the results on the training sets but decrease the test set results.

  abstract: 'We present the contribution of the Unbabel team to the WMT 2019 Shared
    Task on Quality Estimation. We participated on the word, sentence, and document-level
    tracks, encompassing 3 language pairs: English-German, English-Russian, and English-French.
    Our submissions build upon the recent OpenKiwi framework: We combine linear, neural,
    and predictor-estimator systems with new transfer learning approaches using BERT
    and XLM pre-trained models. We compare systems individually and propose new ensemble
    techniques for word and sentence-level predictions. We also propose a simple technique
    for converting word labels into document-level predictions. Overall, our submitted
    systems achieve the best results on all tracks and language pairs by a considerable
    margin.'

  abstract: For translation quality estimation at word and sentence levels, this paper
    presents a novel approach based on BERT that recently has achieved impressive
    results on various natural language processing tasks. Our proposed model is re-purposed
    BERT for the translation quality estimation and uses multi-task learning for the
    sentence-level task and word-level subtasks (i.e., source word, target word, and
    target gap). Experimental results on Quality Estimation shared task of WMT19 show
    that our systems show competitive results and provide significant improvements
    over the baseline.

  abstract: We explore different model architectures for the WMT 19 shared task on
    word-level quality estimation of automatic translation. We start with a model
    similar to Shef-bRNN, which we modify by using conditional random fields for sequence
    labelling. Additionally, we use a different approach for labelling gaps and source
    words. We further develop this model by including features from different sources
    such as BERT, baseline features for the task and transformer encoders. We evaluate
    the performance of our models on the English-German dataset for the corresponding
    shared task.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the submissions of the team from Nanjing University
    for the WMT19 sentence-level Quality Estimation (QE) shared task on English-German
    language pair. We develop two approaches based on a two-stage neural QE model
    consisting of a feature extractor and a quality estimator. More specifically,
    one of the proposed approaches employs the translation knowledge between the two
    languages from two different translation directions; while the other one employs
    extra monolingual knowledge from both source and target sides, obtained by pre-training
    deep self-attention networks. To efficiently train these two-stage models, a joint
    learning training method is applied. Experiments show that the ensemble model
    of the above two models achieves the best results on the benchmark dataset of
    the WMT17 sentence-level QE shared task and obtains competitive results in WMT19,
    ranking 3rd out of 10 submissions.

  abstract: We propose the use of pre-trained embeddings as features of a regression
    model for sentence-level quality estimation of machine translation. In our work
    we combine freely available BERT and LASER multilingual embeddings to train a
    neural-based regression model. In the second proposed method we use as an input
    features not only pre-trained embeddings, but also log probability of any machine
    translation (MT) system. Both methods are applied to several language pairs and
    are evaluated both as a classical quality estimation system (predicting the HTER
    score) as well as an MT metric (predicting human judgements of translation quality).

  abstract: Quality estimation (QE) of machine translation (MT) systems is a task
    of growing importance. It reduces the cost of post-editing, allowing machine-translated
    text to be used in formal occasions. In this work, we describe our submission
    system in WMT 2019 sentence-level QE task. We mainly explore the utilization of
    pre-trained translation models in QE and adopt a bi-directional translation-like
    strategy. The strategy is similar to ELMo, but additionally conditions on source
    sentences. Experiments on WMT QE dataset show that our strategy, which makes the
    pre-training slightly harder, can bring improvements for QE. In WMT-2019 QE task,
    our system ranked in the second place on En-De NMT dataset and the third place
    on En-Ru NMT dataset.

  abstract: "Automatic post-editing (APE) can be reduced to a machine translation\
    \ (MT) task, where the source is the output of a specific MT system and the target\
    \ is its post-edited variant. However, this approach does not consider context\
    \ information that can be found in the original source of the MT system. Thus\
    \ a better approach is to employ multi-source MT, where two input sequences are\
    \ considered \u2013 the one being the original source and the other being the\
    \ MT output. Extra context information can be introduced in the form of extra\
    \ tokens that identify certain global property of a group of segments, added as\
    \ a prefix or a suffix to each segment. Successfully applied in domain adaptation\
    \ of MT as well as on APE, this technique deserves further attention. In this\
    \ work we investigate multi-source neural APE (or NPE) systems with training data\

  abstract: "For this round of the WMT 2019 APE shared task, our submission focuses\
    \ on addressing the \u201Cover-correction\u201D problem in APE. Over-correction\
    \ occurs when the APE system tends to rephrase an already correct MT output, and\
    \ the resulting sentence is penalized by a reference-based evaluation against\
    \ human post-edits. Our intuition is that this problem can be prevented by informing\
    \ the system about the predicted quality of the MT output or, in other terms,\
    \ the expected amount of needed corrections. For this purpose, following the common\
    \ approach in multilingual NMT, we prepend a special token to the beginning of\
    \ both the source text and the MT output indicating the required amount of post-editing.\
    \ Following the best submissions to the WMT 2018 APE shared task, our backbone\
    \ architecture is based on multi-source Transformer to encode both the MT output\
    \ and the corresponding source text. We participated both in the English-German\
    \ and English-Russian subtasks. In the first subtask, our best submission improved\
    \ the original MT output quality up to +0.98 BLEU and -0.47 TER. In the second\
    \ subtask, where the higher quality of the MT output increases the risk of over-correction,\
    \ none of our submitted runs was able to improve the MT output."

  abstract: In this work, we give a description of the TALP-UPC systems submitted
    for the WMT19 Biomedical Translation Task. Our proposed strategy is NMT model-independent
    and relies only on one ingredient, a biomedical terminology list. We first extracted
    such a terminology list by labelling biomedical words in our training dataset
    using the BabelNet API. Then, we designed a data preparation strategy to insert
    the terms information at a token level. Finally, we trained the Transformer model
    with this terms-informed data. Our best-submitted system ranked 2nd and 3rd for
    Spanish-English and English-Spanish translation directions, respectively.

  abstract: Transfer Learning and Selective data training are two of the many approaches
    being extensively investigated to improve the quality of Neural Machine Translation
    systems. This paper presents a series of experiments by applying transfer learning
    and selective data training for participation in the Bio-medical shared task of
    WMT19. We have used Information Retrieval to selectively choose related sentences
    from out-of-domain data and used them as additional training data using transfer
    learning. We also report the effect of tokenization on translation model performance.

  abstract: 'Although the problem of similar language translation has been an area
    of research interest for many years, yet it is still far from being solved. In
    this paper, we study the performance of two popular approaches: statistical and
    neural. We conclude that both methods yield similar results; however, the performance
    varies depending on the language pair. While the statistical approach outperforms
    the neural one by a difference of 6 BLEU points for the Spanish-Portuguese language
    pair, the proposed neural model surpasses the statistical one by a difference
    of 2 BLEU points for Czech-Polish. In the former case, the language similarity
    (based on perplexity) is much higher than in the latter case. Additionally, we
    report negative results for the system combination with back-translation. Our
    TALP-UPC system submission won 1st place for Czech->Polish and 2nd place for Spanish->Portuguese
    in the official evaluation of the 1st WMT Similar Language Translation task.'

  abstract: Within the first shared task on machine translation between similar languages,
    we present our first attempts on Czech to Polish machine translation from an intercomprehension
    perspective. We propose methods based on the mutual intelligibility of the two
    languages, taking advantage of their orthographic and phonological similarity,
    in the hope to improve over our baselines. The translation results are evaluated
    using BLEU. On this metric, none of our proposals could outperform the baselines
    on the final test set. The current setups are rather preliminary, and there are
    several potential improvements we can try in the future.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission to Shared Task on Similar Language
    Translation in Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2019). We submitted
    three systems for Hindi -> Nepali direction in which we have examined the performance
    of a RNN based NMT system, a semi-supervised NMT system where monolingual data
    of both languages is utilized using the architecture by and a system trained with
    extra synthetic sentences generated using copy of source and target sentences
    without using any additional monolingual data.

  abstract: "With the extensive use of Machine Translation (MT) technology, there\
    \ is progressively interest in directly translating between pairs of similar languages.\
    \ Because the main challenge is to overcome the limitation of available parallel\
    \ data to produce a precise MT output. Current work relies on the Neural Machine\
    \ Translation (NMT) with attention mechanism for the similar language translation\
    \ of WMT19 shared task in the context of Hindi-Nepali pair. The NMT systems trained\
    \ the Hindi-Nepali parallel corpus and tested, analyzed in Hindi \u21D4 Nepali\
    \ translation. The official result declared at WMT19 shared task, which shows\
    \ that our NMT system obtained Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score 24.6\
    \ for primary configuration in Nepali to Hindi translation. Also, we have achieved\
    \ BLEU score 53.7 (Hindi to Nepali) and 49.1 (Nepali to Hindi) in contrastive\
    \ system type."

  abstract: We introduce a purely monolingual approach to filtering for parallel data
    from a noisy corpus in a low-resource scenario. Our work is inspired by Junczysdowmunt:2018,
    but we relax the requirements to allow for cases where no parallel data is available.
    Our primary contribution is a dual monolingual cross-entropy delta criterion modified
    from Cynical data selection Axelrod:2017, and is competitive (within 1.8 BLEU)
    with the best bilingual filtering method when used to train SMT systems. Our approach
    is featherweight, and runs end-to-end on a standard laptop in three hours.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our submission to the WMT19 low-resource parallel
    corpus filtering shared task. Our main approach is based on the LASER toolkit
    (Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations), which uses an encoder-decoder architecture
    trained on a parallel corpus to obtain multilingual sentence representations.
    We then use the representations directly to score and filter the noisy parallel
    sentences without additionally training a scoring function. We contrast our approach
    to other promising methods and show that LASER yields strong results. Finally,
    we produce an ensemble of different scoring methods and obtain additional gains.
    Our submission achieved the best overall performance for both the Nepali-English
    and Sinhala-English 1M tasks by a margin of 1.3 and 1.4 BLEU respectively, as
    compared to the second best systems. Moreover, our experiments show that this
    technique is promising for low and even no-resource scenarios.

    to test various methods of filtering a noisy parallel corpora, to make them useful
    for training machine translation systems. This year the noisy corpora are the
    relatively low-resource language pairs of Nepali-English and Sinhala-English.
    This papers describes the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) submissions, including
    preprocessing methods and scoring metrics. Numerical results indicate a benefit
    over baseline and the relative benefits of different options.

  abstract: We present a very simple method for parallel text cleaning of low-resource
    languages, based on projection of word embeddings trained on large monolingual
    corpora in high-resource languages. In spite of its simplicity, we approach the
    strong baseline system in the downstream machine translation evaluation.

  abstract: "The filtering task of noisy parallel corpora in WMT2019 aims to challenge\
    \ participants to create filtering methods to be useful for training machine translation\
    \ systems. In this work, we introduce a noisy parallel corpora filtering system\
    \ based on generating hypotheses by means of a translation model. We train translation\
    \ models in both language pairs: Nepali\u2013English and Sinhala\u2013English\
    \ using provided parallel corpora. We select the training subset for three language\
    \ pairs (Nepali, Sinhala and Hindi to English) jointly using bilingual cross-entropy\
    \ selection to create the best possible translation model for both language pairs.\
    \ Once the translation models are trained, we translate the noisy corpora and\
    \ generate a hypothesis for each sentence pair. We compute the smoothed BLEU score\
    \ between the target sentence and generated hypothesis. In addition, we apply\
    \ several rules to discard very noisy or inadequate sentences which can lower\
    \ the translation score. These heuristics are based on sentence length, source\
    \ and target similarity and source language detection. We compare our results\
    \ with the baseline published on the shared task website, which uses the Zipporah\
    \ model, over which we achieve significant improvements in one of the conditions\
    \ in the shared task. The designed filtering system is domain independent and\
    \ all experiments are conducted using neural machine translation."

  abstract: "In this paper, we describe the IIT Patna\u2019s submission to WMT 2019\
    \ shared task on parallel corpus filtering. This shared task asks the participants\
    \ to develop methods for scoring each parallel sentence from a given noisy parallel\
    \ corpus. Quality of the scoring method is judged based on the quality of SMT\
    \ and NMT systems trained on smaller set of high-quality parallel sentences sub-sampled\
    \ from the original noisy corpus. This task has two language pairs. We submit\
    \ for both the Nepali-English and Sinhala-English language pairs. We define fuzzy\
    \ string matching score between English and the translated (into English) source\
    \ based on Levenshtein distance. Based on the scores, we sub-sample two sets (having\
    \ 1 million and 5 millions English tokens) of parallel sentences from each parallel\
    \ corpus, and train SMT systems for development purpose only. The organizers publish\
    \ the official evaluation using both SMT and NMT on the final official test set.\
    \ Total 10 teams participated in the shared task and according the official evaluation,\
    \ our scoring method obtains 2nd position in the team ranking for 1-million NepaliEnglish\
    \ NMT and 5-million Sinhala-English NMT categories."

  abstract: Open domain dialog systems face the challenge of being repetitive and
    producing generic responses. In this paper, we demonstrate that by conditioning
    the response generation on interpretable discrete dialog attributes and composed
    attributes, it helps improve the model perplexity and results in diverse and interesting
    non-redundant responses. We propose to formulate the dialog attribute prediction
    as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and use policy gradients methods to optimize
    utterance generation using long-term rewards. Unlike existing RL approaches which
    formulate the token prediction as a policy, our method reduces the complexity
    of the policy optimization by limiting the action space to dialog attributes,
    thereby making the policy optimization more practical and sample efficient. We
    demonstrate this with experimental and human evaluations.

  abstract: Learning suitable and well-performing dialogue behaviour in statistical
    spoken dialogue systems has been in the focus of research for many years. While
    most work which is based on reinforcement learning employs an objective measure
    like task success for modelling the reward signal, we use a reward based on user
    satisfaction estimation. We propose a novel estimator and show that it outperforms
    all previous estimators while learning temporal dependencies implicitly. Furthermore,
    we apply this novel user satisfaction estimation model live in simulated experiments
    where the satisfaction estimation model is trained on one domain and applied in
    many other domains which cover a similar task. We show that applying this model
    results in higher estimated satisfaction, similar task success rates and a higher
    robustness to noise.

  abstract: "Dialogue systems are increasingly using knowledge bases (KBs) storing\
    \ real-world facts to help generate quality responses. However, as the KBs are\
    \ inherently incomplete and remain fixed during conversation, it limits dialogue\
    \ systems\u2019 ability to answer questions and to handle questions involving\
    \ entities or relations that are not in the KB. In this paper, we make an attempt\
    \ to propose an engine for Continuous and Interactive Learning of Knowledge (CILK)\
    \ for dialogue systems to give them the ability to continuously and interactively\
    \ learn and infer new knowledge during conversations. With more knowledge accumulated\
    \ over time, they will be able to learn better and answer more questions. Our\
    \ empirical evaluation shows that CILK is promising."

  abstract: "Learning with minimal data is one of the key challenges in the development\
    \ of practical, production-ready goal-oriented dialogue systems. In a real-world\
    \ enterprise setting where dialogue systems are developed rapidly and are expected\
    \ to work robustly for an ever-growing variety of domains, products, and scenarios,\
    \ efficient learning from a limited number of examples becomes indispensable.\
    \ In this paper, we introduce a technique to achieve state-of-the-art dialogue\
    \ generation performance in a few-shot setup, without using any annotated data.\
    \ We do this by leveraging background knowledge from a larger, more highly represented\
    \ dialogue source \u2014 namely, the MetaLWOz dataset. We evaluate our model on\
    \ the Stanford Multi-Domain Dialogue Dataset, consisting of human-human goal-oriented\
    \ dialogues in in-car navigation, appointment scheduling, and weather information\
    \ domains. We show that our few-shot approach achieves state-of-the art results\
    \ on that dataset by consistently outperforming the previous best model in terms\
    \ of BLEU and Entity F1 scores, while being more data-efficient than it by not\
    \ requiring any data annotation."

  abstract: "Dialogue state tracking is an important component in task-oriented dialogue\
    \ systems to identify users\u2019 goals and requests as a dialogue proceeds. However,\
    \ as most previous models are dependent on dialogue slots, the model complexity\
    \ soars when the number of slots increases. In this paper, we put forward a slot-independent\
    \ neural model (SIM) to track dialogue states while keeping the model complexity\
    \ invariant to the number of dialogue slots. The model utilizes attention mechanisms\
    \ between user utterance and system actions. SIM achieves state-of-the-art results\
    \ on WoZ and DSTC2 tasks, with only 20% of the model size of previous models."

  abstract: "With the advent of conversational assistants, like Amazon Alexa, Google\
    \ Now, etc., dialogue systems are gaining a lot of traction, especially in industrial\
    \ setting. These systems typically consist of Spoken Language understanding component\
    \ which, in turn, consists of two tasks - Intent Classification (IC) and Slot\
    \ Labeling (SL). Generally, these two tasks are modeled together jointly to achieve\
    \ best performance. However, this joint modeling adds to model obfuscation. In\
    \ this work, we first design framework for a modularization of joint IC-SL task\
    \ to enhance architecture transparency. Then, we explore a number of self-attention,\
    \ convolutional, and recurrent models, contributing a large-scale analysis of\
    \ modeling paradigms for IC+SL across two datasets. Finally, using this framework,\
    \ we propose a class of \u2018label-recurrent\u2019 models that otherwise non-recurrent,\
    \ with a 10-dimensional representation of the label history, and show that our\
    \ proposed systems are easy to interpret, highly accurate (achieving over 30%\
    \ error reduction in SL over the state-of-the-art on the Snips dataset), as well\
    \ as fast, at 2x the inference and 2/3 to 1/2 the training time of comparable\
    \ recurrent models, thus giving an edge in critical real-world systems."

  abstract: In a spoken dialogue system, dialogue state tracker (DST) components track
    the state of the conversation by updating a distribution of values associated
    with each of the slots being tracked for the current user turn, using the interactions
    until then. Much of the previous work has relied on modeling the natural order
    of the conversation, using distance based offsets as an approximation of time.
    In this work, we hypothesize that leveraging the wall-clock temporal difference
    between turns is crucial for finer-grained control of dialogue scenarios. We develop
    a novel approach that applies a time mask, based on the wall-clock time difference,
    to the associated slot embeddings and empirically demonstrate that our proposed
    approach outperforms existing approaches that leverage distance offsets, on both
    an internal benchmark dataset as well as DSTC2.

  abstract: In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning
    methods for dialog policy training such as prioritized experience replay, double
    deep Q-Networks, dueling network architectures and distributional learning. Our
    main findings show that each individual method improves the rewards and the task
    success rate but combining these methods in a Rainbow agent, which performs best
    across tasks and environments, is a non-trivial task. We, therefore, provide insights
    about the influence of each method on the combination and how to combine them
    to form a Rainbow agent.

  abstract: "Utterance-level analysis of the speaker\u2019s intentions and emotions\
    \ is a core task in conversational understanding. Depending on the end objective\
    \ of the conversational understanding task, different categorical dialog-act or\
    \ affect labels are expertly designed to cover specific aspects of the speakers\u2019\
    \ intentions or emotions respectively. Accurately annotating with these labels\
    \ requires a high level of human expertise, and thus applying this process to\
    \ a large conversation corpus or new domains is prohibitively expensive. The resulting\
    \ paucity of data limits the use of sophisticated neural models. In this paper,\
    \ we tackle these limitations by performing unsupervised training of utterance\
    \ representations from a large corpus of spontaneous dialogue data. Models initialized\
    \ with these representations achieve competitive performance on utterance-level\
    \ dialogue-act recognition and emotion classification, especially in low-resource\
    \ settings encountered when analyzing conversations in new domains."

  abstract: 'Dialogue state tracking requires the population and maintenance of a
    multi-slot frame representation of the dialogue state. Frequently, dialogue state
    tracking systems assume independence between slot values within a frame. In this
    paper we argue that treating the prediction of each slot value as an independent
    prediction task may ignore important associations between the slot values, and,
    consequently, we argue that treating dialogue state tracking as a structured prediction
    problem can help to improve dialogue state tracking performance. To support this
    argument, the research presented in this paper is structured into three stages:
    (i) analyzing variable dependencies in dialogue data; (ii) applying an energy-based
    methodology to model dialogue state tracking as a structured prediction task;
    and (iii) evaluating the impact of inter-slot relationships on model performance.
    Overall we demonstrate that modelling the associations between target slots with
    an energy-based formalism improves dialogue state tracking performance in a number
    of ways.'

  abstract: Slot filling is a core operation for utterance understanding in task-oriented
    dialogue systems. Slots are typically domain-specific, and adding new domains
    to a dialogue system involves data and time-intensive processes. A popular technique
    to address the problem is transfer learning, where it is assumed the availability
    of a large slot filling dataset for the source domain, to be used to help slot
    filling on the target domain, with fewer data. In this work, instead, we propose
    to leverage source tasks based on semantically related non-conversational resources
    (e.g., semantic sequence tagging datasets), as they are both cheaper to obtain
    and reusable to several slot filling domains. We show that using auxiliary non-conversational
    tasks in a multi-task learning setup consistently improves low resource slot filling
    performance.

  abstract: "Some of the major challenges in training conversational agents include\
    \ the lack of large-scale data of real-world complexity, defining appropriate\
    \ evaluation measures, and managing meaningful conversations across many topics\
    \ over long periods of time. Moreover, most works tend to assume that the conversational\
    \ agent\u2019s environment is stationary, a somewhat strong assumption. To remove\
    \ this assumption and overcome the lack of data, we take a step away from the\
    \ traditional training pipeline and model the conversation as a stochastic collaborative\
    \ game. Each agent (player) has a role (\u201Cassistant\u201D, \u201Ctourist\u201D\
    , \u201Ceater\u201D, etc.) and their own objectives, and can only interact via\
    \ language they generate. Each agent, therefore, needs to learn to operate optimally\
    \ in an environment with multiple sources of uncertainty (its own LU and LG, the\
    \ other agent\u2019s LU, Policy, and LG). In this work, we present the first complete\
    \ attempt at concurrently training conversational agents that communicate only\
    \ via self-generated language and show that they outperform supervised and deep\
    \ learning baselines."

  abstract: 'Recent advances in neural sequence-to-sequence models have led to promising
    results for several language generation-based tasks, including dialogue response
    generation, summarization, and machine translation. However, these models are
    known to have several problems, especially in the context of chit-chat based dialogue
    systems: they tend to generate short and dull responses that are often too generic.
    Furthermore, these models do not ground conversational responses on knowledge
    and facts, resulting in turns that are not accurate, informative and engaging
    for the users. In this paper, we propose and experiment with a series of response
    generation models that aim to serve in the general scenario where in addition
    to the dialogue context, relevant unstructured external knowledge in the form
    of text is also assumed to be available for models to harness. Our proposed approach
    extends pointer-generator networks (See et al., 2017) by allowing the decoder
    to hierarchically attend and copy from external knowledge in addition to the dialogue
    context. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed model compared
    to several baselines including (Ghazvininejadet al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018)
    through both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation on ConvAI2 dataset.'

  abstract: Learning an efficient manager of dialogue agent from data with little
    manual intervention is important, especially for goal-oriented dialogues. However,
    existing methods either take too many manual efforts (e.g. reinforcement learning
    methods) or cannot guarantee the dialogue efficiency (e.g. sequence-to-sequence
    methods). In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel end-to-end
    learning model to train a dialogue agent that can look ahead for several future
    turns and generate an optimal response to make the dialogue efficient. Our method
    is data-driven and does not require too much manual work for intervention during
    system design. We evaluate our method on two datasets of different scenarios and
    the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model.

  abstract: "Although the data-driven approaches of some recent bot building platforms\
    \ make it possible for a wide range of users to easily create dialogue systems,\
    \ those platforms don\u2019t offer tools for quickly identifying which log dialogues\
    \ contain problems. This is important since corrections to log dialogues provide\
    \ a means to improve performance after deployment. A log dialogue ranker, which\
    \ ranks problematic dialogues higher, is an essential tool due to the sheer volume\
    \ of log dialogues that could be generated. However, training a ranker typically\
    \ requires labelling a substantial amount of data, which is not feasible for most\
    \ users. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised approach for dialogue\
    \ ranking using GANs and release a corpus of labelled dialogues for evaluation\
    \ and comparison with supervised methods. The evaluation result shows that our\
    \ method compares favorably to supervised methods without any labelled data."

  abstract: "Domain adaptation in natural language generation (NLG) remains challenging\
    \ because of the high complexity of input semantics across domains and limited\
    \ data of a target domain. This is particularly the case for dialogue systems,\
    \ where we want to be able to seamlessly include new domains into the conversation.\
    \ Therefore, it is crucial for generation models to share knowledge across domains\
    \ for the effective adaptation from one domain to another. In this study, we exploit\
    \ a tree-structured semantic encoder to capture the internal structure of complex\
    \ semantic representations required for multi-domain dialogues in order to facilitate\
    \ knowledge sharing across domains. In addition, a layer-wise attention mechanism\
    \ between the tree encoder and the decoder is adopted to further improve the model\u2019\
    s capability. The automatic evaluation results show that our model outperforms\
    \ previous methods in terms of the BLEU score and the slot error rate, in particular\
    \ when the adaptation data is limited. In subjective evaluation, human judges\
    \ tend to prefer the sentences generated by our model, rating them more highly\
    \ on informativeness and naturalness than other systems."

  abstract: Neural dialog models have exhibited strong performance, however their
    end-to-end nature lacks a representation of the explicit structure of dialog.
    This results in a loss of generalizability, controllability and a data-hungry
    nature. Conversely, more traditional dialog systems do have strong models of explicit
    structure. This paper introduces several approaches for explicitly incorporating
    structure into neural models of dialog. Structured Fusion Networks first learn
    neural dialog modules corresponding to the structured components of traditional
    dialog systems and then incorporate these modules in a higher-level generative
    model. Structured Fusion Networks obtain strong results on the MultiWOZ dataset,
    both with and without reinforcement learning. Structured Fusion Networks are shown
    to have several valuable properties, including better domain generalizability,
    improved performance in reduced data scenarios and robustness to divergence during
    reinforcement learning.

  abstract: This paper proposes a novel end-to-end architecture for task-oriented
    dialogue systems. It is based on a simple and practical yet very effective sequence-to-sequence
    approach, where language understanding and state tracking tasks are modeled jointly
    with a structured copy-augmented sequential decoder and a multi-label decoder
    for each slot. The policy engine and language generation tasks are modeled jointly
    following that. The copy-augmented sequential decoder deals with new or unknown
    values in the conversation, while the multi-label decoder combined with the sequential
    decoder ensures the explicit assignment of values to slots. On the generation
    part, slot binary classifiers are used to improve performance. This architecture
    is scalable to real-world scenarios and is shown through an empirical evaluation
    to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the Cambridge Restaurant dataset
    and the Stanford in-car assistant dataset.

  abstract: This paper presents FriendsQA, a challenging question answering dataset
    that contains 1,222 dialogues and 10,610 open-domain questions, to tackle machine
    comprehension on everyday conversations. Each dialogue, involving multiple speakers,
    is annotated with several types of questions regarding the dialogue contexts,
    and the answers are annotated with certain spans in the dialogue. A series of
    crowdsourcing tasks are conducted to ensure good annotation quality, resulting
    a high inter-annotator agreement of 81.82%. A comprehensive annotation analytics
    is provided for a deeper understanding in this dataset. Three state-of-the-art
    QA systems are experimented, R-Net, QANet, and BERT, and evaluated on this dataset.
    BERT in particular depicts promising results, an accuracy of 74.2% for answer
    utterance selection and an F1-score of 64.2% for answer span selection, suggesting
    that the FriendsQA task is hard yet has a great potential of elevating QA research
    on multiparty dialogue to another level.

  abstract: "In this paper, we examine the foundations of task-oriented dialogues,\
    \ in which systems are requested to perform tasks for humans. We argue that the\
    \ way this dialogue task has been framed has limited its applicability to processing\
    \ simple requests with atomic \u201Cslot-fillers\u201D. However, real task-oriented\
    \ dialogues can contain more complex utterances that provide non-atomic constraints\
    \ on slot values. For example, in response to the system\u2019s question \u201C\
    What time do you want me to reserve the restaurant?\u201D, a user should be able\
    \ to say \u201Cthe earliest time available,\u201D which cannot be handled by classic\
    \ \u201Cintent + slots\u201D approaches that do not incorporate expressive logical\
    \ form meaning representations. Furthermore, situations for which it would be\
    \ desirable to build task-oriented dialogue systems, e.g., to engage in mixed-initiative,\
    \ collaborative or multiparty dialogues, will require a more general approach.\
    \ In order to overcome these limitations and to provide such an approach, we give\
    \ a logical analysis of the \u201Cintent+slot\u201D dialogue setting using a modal\
    \ logic of intention and including a more expansive notion of \u201Cdialogue state\u201D\
    . Finally, we briefly discuss our program of research to build a next generation\
    \ of plan-based dialogue systems that goes beyond \u201Cintent + slots\u201D."

  abstract: Humans use a variety of approaches to reference objects in the external
    world, including verbal descriptions, hand and head gestures, eye gaze or any
    combination of them. The amount of useful information from each modality, however,
    may vary depending on the specific person and on several other factors. For this
    reason, it is important to learn the correct combination of inputs for inferring
    the best-fitting reference. In this paper, we investigate appropriate speaker-dependent
    and independent fusion strategies in a multimodal reference resolution task. We
    show that without any change in the modality models, only through an optimized
    fusion technique, it is possible to reduce the error rate of the system on a reference
    resolution task by more than 50%.

  abstract: Understanding and conversing about dynamic scenes is one of the key capabilities
    of AI agents that navigate the environment and convey useful information to humans.
    Video question answering is a specific scenario of such AI-human interaction where
    an agent generates a natural language response to a question regarding the video
    of a dynamic scene. Incorporating features from multiple modalities, which often
    provide supplementary information, is one of the challenging aspects of video
    question answering. Furthermore, a question often concerns only a small segment
    of the video, hence encoding the entire video sequence using a recurrent neural
    network is not computationally efficient. Our proposed question-guided video representation
    module efficiently generates the token-level video summary guided by each word
    in the question. The learned representations are then fused with the question
    to generate the answer. Through empirical evaluation on the Audio Visual Scene-aware
    Dialog (AVSD) dataset, our proposed models in single-turn and multi-turn question
    answering achieve state-of-the-art performance on several automatic natural language
    generation evaluation metrics.

  abstract: Automatically classifying the relation between sentences in a discourse
    is a challenging task, in particular when there is no overt expression of the
    relation. It becomes even more challenging by the fact that annotated training
    data exists only for a small number of languages, such as English and Chinese.
    We present a new system using zero-shot transfer learning for implicit discourse
    relation classification, where the only resource used for the target language
    is unannotated parallel text. This system is evaluated on the discourse-annotated
    TED-MDB parallel corpus, where it obtains good results for all seven languages
    using only English training data.

  abstract: Prior work on temporal relation classification has focused extensively
    on event pairs in the same or adjacent sentences (local), paying scant attention
    to discourse-level (global) pairs. This restricts the ability of systems to learn
    temporal links between global pairs, since reliance on local syntactic features
    suffices to achieve reasonable performance on existing datasets. However, systems
    should be capable of incorporating cues from document-level structure to assign
    temporal relations. In this work, we take a first step towards discourse-level
    temporal ordering by creating TDDiscourse, the first dataset focusing specifically
    on temporal links between event pairs which are more than one sentence apart.
    We create TDDiscourse by augmenting TimeBank-Dense, a corpus of English news articles,
    manually annotating global pairs that cannot be inferred automatically from existing
    annotations. Our annotations double the number of temporal links in TimeBank-Dense,
    while possessing several desirable properties such as focusing on long-distance
    pairs and not being automatically inferable. We adapt and benchmark the performance
    of three state-of-the-art models on TDDiscourse and observe that existing systems
    indeed find discourse-level temporal ordering harder.

  abstract: It is often hard to apply the newest advances in research to real life
    scenarios. They usually require the resolution of some specific task applied to
    a restricted domain, all the while providing small amounts of data to begin with.
    In this study we apply one of the newest innovations in Deep Learning to a task
    of text classification. We created a question answering system in Italian that
    provides information about a specific subject, e-invoicing and digital billing.
    Italy recently introduced a new legislation about e-invoicing and people have
    some legit doubts, therefore a large share of professionals could benefit from
    this tool.

  abstract: We present a new neural architecture for wide-coverage Natural Language
    Understanding in Spoken Dialogue Systems. We develop a hierarchical multi-task
    architecture, which delivers a multi-layer representation of sentence meaning
    (i.e., Dialogue Acts and Frame-like structures). The architecture is a hierarchy
    of self-attention mechanisms and BiLSTM encoders followed by CRF tagging layers.
    We describe a variety of experiments, showing that our approach obtains promising
    results on a dataset annotated with Dialogue Acts and Frame Semantics. Moreover,
    we demonstrate its applicability to a different, publicly available NLU dataset
    annotated with domain-specific intents and corresponding semantic roles, providing
    overall performance higher than state-of-the-art tools such as RASA, Dialogflow,
    LUIS, and Watson. For example, we show an average 4.45% improvement in entity
    tagging F-score over Rasa, Dialogflow and LUIS.

  abstract: Dialog state tracking is used to estimate the current belief state of
    a dialog given all the preceding conversation. Machine reading comprehension,
    on the other hand, focuses on building systems that read passages of text and
    answer questions that require some understanding of passages. We formulate dialog
    state tracking as a reading comprehension task to answer the question what is
    the state of the current dialog? after reading conversational context. In contrast
    to traditional state tracking methods where the dialog state is often predicted
    as a distribution over a closed set of all the possible slot values within an
    ontology, our method uses a simple attention-based neural network to point to
    the slot values within the conversation. Experiments on MultiWOZ-2.0 cross-domain
    dialog dataset show that our simple system can obtain similar accuracies compared
    to the previous more complex methods. By exploiting recent advances in contextual
    word embeddings, adding a model that explicitly tracks whether a slot value should
    be carried over to the next turn, and combining our method with a traditional
    joint state tracking method that relies on closed set vocabulary, we can obtain
    a joint-goal accuracy of 47.33% on the standard test split, exceeding current
    state-of-the-art by 11.75%**.

  abstract: 'Acoustic addressee detection (AD) is a modern paralinguistic and dialogue
    challenge that especially arises in voice assistants. In the present study, we
    distinguish addressees in two settings (a conversation between several people
    and a spoken dialogue system, and a conversation between several adults and a
    child) and introduce the first competitive baseline (unweighted average recall
    equals 0.891) for the Voice Assistant Conversation Corpus that models the first
    setting. We jointly solve both classification problems, using three models: a
    linear support vector machine dealing with acoustic functionals and two neural
    networks utilising raw waveforms alongside with acoustic low-level descriptors.
    We investigate how different corpora influence each other, applying the mixup
    approach to data augmentation. We also study the influence of various acoustic
    context lengths on AD. Two-second speech fragments turn out to be sufficient for
    reliable AD. Mixup is shown to be beneficial for merging acoustic data (extracted
    features but not raw waveforms) from different domains that allows us to reach
    a higher classification performance on human-machine AD and also for training
    a multipurpose neural network that is capable of solving both human-machine and
    adult-child AD problems.'

  abstract: Pitch has long been held as an important signalling channel when planning
    and deploying speech in conversation, and myriad studies have been undertaken
    to determine the extent to which it actually plays this role. Unfortunately, these
    studies have required considerable human investment in data preparation and analysis,
    and have therefore often been limited to a handful of specific conversational
    contexts. The current article proposes a framework which addresses these limitations,
    by enabling a scalable, quantitative characterization of the role of pitch throughout
    an entire conversation, requiring only the raw signal and speech activity references.
    The framework is evaluated on the Switchboard dialogue corpus. Experiments indicate
    that pitch trajectories of both parties are predictive of their incipient speech
    activity; that pitch should be expressed on a logarithmic scale and Z-normalized,
    as well as accompanied by a binary voicing variable; and that only the most recent
    400 ms of the pitch trajectory are useful in incipient speech activity prediction.

    \ We systematically introduced emotionally expressive interjections (e.g., \u201C\
    Wow!\u201D) and filler words (e.g., \u201Cum\u201D, \u201Cmhmm\u201D) in an Amazon\
    \ Alexa Prize socialbot, Gunrock. We tested whether these TTS manipulations improved\
    \ users\u2019 ratings of their conversation across thousands of real user interactions\
    \ (n=5,527). Results showed that interjections and fillers each improved users\u2019\
    \ holistic ratings, an improvement that further increased if the system used both\
    \ manipulations. A separate perception experiment corroborated the findings from\
    \ the user study, with improved social ratings for conversations including interjections;\
    \ however, no positive effect was observed for fillers, suggesting that the role\
    \ of the rater in the conversation\u2014as active participant or external listener\u2014\
    is an important factor in assessing social dialogs."

  abstract: "We describe a longitudinal user study conducted in the context of a Spoken\
    \ Dialogue System for a household robot, where we examined the influence of time\
    \ displacement and situational risk on users\u2019 preferred responses. To this\
    \ effect, we employed a corpus of spoken requests that asked a robot to fetch\
    \ or move objects in a room. In the first stage of our study, participants selected\
    \ among four response types to these requests under two risk conditions: low and\
    \ high. After some time, the same participants rated several responses to the\
    \ previous requests \u2014 these responses were instantiated from the four response\
    \ types. Our results show that participants did not rate highly their own response\
    \ types; moreover, they rated their own response types similarly to different\
    \ ones. This suggests that, at least in this context, people\u2019s preferences\
    \ at a particular point in time may not reflect their general attitudes, and that\
    \ various reasonable response types may be equally acceptable. Our study also\
    \ reveals that situational risk influences the acceptability of some response\
    \ types."

  abstract: The main aim of this paper is to provide a characterization of the response
    space for questions using a taxonomy grounded in a dialogical formal semantics.
    As a starting point we take the typology for responses in the form of questions
    provided in (Lupkowski and Ginzburg, 2016). This work develops a wide coverage
    taxonomy for question/question sequences observable in corpora including the BNC,
    CHILDES, and BEE, as well as formal modelling of all the postulated classes. Our
    aim is to extend this work to cover all responses to questions. We present the
    extended typology of responses to questions based on a corpus studies of BNC,
    BEE and Maptask with include 506, 262, and 467 question/response pairs respectively.
    We compare the data for English with data from Polish using the Spokes corpus
    (205 question/response pairs). We discuss annotation reliability and disagreement
    analysis. We sketch how each class can be formalized using a dialogical semantics
    appropriate for dialogue management.

  abstract: "Despite recent attempts in the field of explainable AI to go beyond black\
    \ box prediction models, typically already the training data for supervised machine\
    \ learning is collected in a manner that treats the annotator as a \u201Cblack\
    \ box\u201D, the internal workings of which remains unobserved. We present an\
    \ annotation method where a task is given to a pair of annotators who collaborate\
    \ on finding the best response. With this we want to shed light on the questions\
    \ if the collaboration increases the quality of the responses and if this \u201C\
    thinking together\u201D provides useful information in itself, as it at least\
    \ partially reveals their reasoning steps. Furthermore, we expect that this setting\
    \ puts the focus on explanation as a linguistic act, vs. explainability as a property\
    \ of models. In a crowd-sourcing experiment, we investigated three different annotation\
    \ tasks, each in a collaborative dialogical (two annotators) and monological (one\
    \ annotator) setting. Our results indicate that our experiment elicits collaboration\
    \ and that this collaboration increases the response accuracy. We see large differences\
    \ in the annotators\u2019 behavior depending on the task. Similarly, we also observe\
    \ that the dialog patterns emerging from the collaboration vary significantly\
    \ with the task."

  abstract: "In this paper we aim to predict dialogue success and user satisfaction\
    \ as well as emotion on a turn level. To achieve this, we investigate the use\
    \ of spectrogram representations, extracted from audio files, in combination with\
    \ several types of convolutional neural networks. The experiments were performed\
    \ on the Let\u2019s Go V2 database, comprising 5065 audio files and having labels\
    \ for subjective and objective dialogue turn success, as well as the emotional\
    \ state of the user. Results show that by using only audio, it is possible to\
    \ predict turn success with very high accuracy for all three labels (90%). The\
    \ best performing input representation were 1s long mel-spectrograms in combination\
    \ with a CNN with a bottleneck architecture. The resulting system has the potential\
    \ to be used real-time. Our results significantly surpass the state of the art\

  abstract: In dialogue, speakers continuously adapt their speech to accommodate the
    listener, based on the feedback they receive. In this paper, we explore the modelling
    of such behaviours in the context of a robot presenting a painting. A Behaviour
    Tree is used to organise the behaviour on different levels, and allow the robot
    to adapt its behaviour in real-time; the tree organises engagement, joint attention,
    turn-taking, feedback and incremental speech processing. An initial implementation
    of the model is presented, and the system is evaluated in a user study, where
    the adaptive robot presenter is compared to a non-adaptive version. The adaptive
    version is found to be more engaging by the users, although no effects are found
    on the retention of the presented material.

  abstract: "Negotiation is a complex activity involving strategic reasoning, persuasion,\
    \ and psychology. An average person is often far from an expert in negotiation.\
    \ Our goal is to assist humans to become better negotiators through a machine-in-the-loop\
    \ approach that combines machine\u2019s advantage at data-driven decision-making\
    \ and human\u2019s language generation ability. We consider a bargaining scenario\
    \ where a seller and a buyer negotiate the price of an item for sale through a\
    \ text-based dialogue. Our negotiation coach monitors messages between them and\
    \ recommends strategies in real time to the seller to get a better deal (e.g.,\
    \ \u201Creject the proposal and propose a price\u201D, \u201Ctalk about your personal\
    \ experience with the product\u201D). The best strategy largely depends on the\
    \ context (e.g., the current price, the buyer\u2019s attitude). Therefore, we\
    \ first identify a set of negotiation strategies, then learn to predict the best\
    \ strategy in a given dialogue context from a set of human-human bargaining dialogues.\
    \ Evaluation on human-human dialogues shows that our coach increases the profits\
    \ of the seller by almost 60%."

  abstract: The aim of this paper is to mitigate the shortcomings of automatic evaluation
    of open-domain dialog systems through multi-reference evaluation. Existing metrics
    have been shown to correlate poorly with human judgement, particularly in open-domain
    dialog. One alternative is to collect human annotations for evaluation, which
    can be expensive and time consuming. To demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-reference
    evaluation, we augment the test set of DailyDialog with multiple references. A
    series of experiments show that the use of multiple references results in improved
    correlation between several automatic metrics and human judgement for both the
    quality and the diversity of system output.

  abstract: We present the first complete spoken dialogue system driven by a multiimensional
    statistical dialogue manager. This framework has been shown to substantially reduce
    data needs by leveraging domain-independent dimensions, such as social obligations
    or feedback, which (as we show) can be transferred between domains. In this paper,
    we conduct a user study and show that the performance of a multi-dimensional system,
    which can be adapted from a source domain, is equivalent to that of a one-dimensional
    baseline, which can only be trained from scratch.

  abstract: "We present the results we obtained on the classification of dialogue\
    \ acts in a corpus of human-human team communication in the domain of robot-assisted\
    \ disaster response. We annotated dialogue acts according to the ISO 24617-2 standard\
    \ scheme and carried out experiments using the FastText linear classifier as well\
    \ as several neural architectures, including feed-forward, recurrent and convolutional\
    \ neural models with different types of embeddings, context and attention mechanism.\
    \ The best performance was achieved with a \u201DDivide & Merge\u201D architecture\
    \ presented in the paper, using trainable GloVe embeddings and a structured dialogue\
    \ history. This model learns from the current utterance and the preceding context\
    \ separately and then combines the two generated representations. Average accuracy\
    \ of 10-fold cross-validation is 79.8%, F-score 71.8%."

  abstract: This paper describes the use of Multi-Task Neural Networks (NNs) for system
    dialogue act selection. These models leverage the representations learned by the
    Natural Language Understanding (NLU) unit to enable robust initialization/bootstrapping
    of dialogue policies from medium sized initial data sets. We evaluate the models
    on two goal-oriented dialogue corpora in the travel booking domain. Results show
    the proposed models improve over models trained without knowledge of NLU tasks.

  abstract: We present B. Rex, a dialogue agent for book recommendations. B. Rex aims
    to exploit the cognitive ease of natural dialogue and the excitement of a whimsical
    persona in order to engage users who might not enjoy using more common interfaces
    for finding new books. B. Rex succeeds in making book recommendations with good
    quality based on only information revealed by the user in the dialogue.

  abstract: "Adding interactive capabilities to pedestrian wayfinding systems in the\
    \ form of spoken dialogue will make them more natural to humans. Such an interactive\
    \ wayfinding system needs to continuously understand and interpret pedestrian\u2019\
    s utterances referring to the spatial context. Achieving this requires the system\
    \ to identify exophoric referring expressions in the utterances, and link these\
    \ expressions to the geographic entities in the vicinity. This exophoric spatial\
    \ reference resolution problem is difficult, as there are often several dozens\
    \ of candidate referents. We present a neural network-based approach for identifying\
    \ pedestrian\u2019s references (using a network called RefNet) and resolving them\
    \ to appropriate geographic objects (using a network called SpaceRefNet). Both\
    \ methods show promising results beating the respective baselines and earlier\
    \ reported results in the literature."

  abstract: Discourse relation classification has proven to be a hard task, with rather
    low performance on several corpora that notably differ on the relation set they
    use. We propose to decompose the task into smaller, mostly binary tasks corresponding
    to various primitive concepts encoded into the discourse relation definitions.
    More precisely, we translate the discourse relations into a set of values for
    attributes based on distinctions used in the mappings between discourse frameworks
    proposed by Sanders et al. (2018). This arguably allows for a more robust representation
    of discourse relations, and enables us to address usually ignored aspects of discourse
    relation prediction, namely multiple labels and underspecified annotations. We
    show experimentally which of the conceptual primitives are harder to learn from
    the Penn Discourse Treebank English corpus, and propose a correspondence to predict
    the original labels, with preliminary empirical comparisons with a direct model.

  abstract: Word pairs across argument spans have been shown to be effective for predicting
    the discourse relation between them. We propose an approach to distill knowledge
    from word pairs for discourse relation classification with convolutional neural
    networks by incorporating joint learning of implicit and explicit relations. Our
    novel approach of representing the input as word pairs achieves state-of-the-art
    results on four-way classification of both implicit and explicit relations as
    well as one of the binary classification tasks. For explicit relation prediction,
    we achieve around 20% error reduction on the four-way task. At the same time,
    compared to a two-layered Bi-LSTM-CRF model, our model is able to achieve these
    results with half the number of learnable parameters and approximately half the
    amount of training time.

  abstract: This work compares the performances achieved by Phrase-Based Statistical
    Machine Translation systems (PB-SMT) and attention-based Neuronal Machine Translation
    systems (NMT) when translating User Generated Content (UGC), as encountered in
    social medias, from French to English. We show that, contrary to what could be
    expected, PBSMT outperforms NMT when translating non-canonical inputs. Our error
    analysis uncovers the specificities of UGC that are problematic for sequential
    NMT architectures and suggests new avenue for improving NMT models.

  abstract: "Standard approaches to treebanking traditionally employ a waterfall model\
    \ (Sommerville, 2010), where annotation guidelines guide the annotation process\
    \ and insights from the annotation process in turn lead to subsequent changes\
    \ in the annotation guidelines. This process remains a very expensive step in\
    \ creating linguistic resources for a target language, necessitates both linguistic\
    \ expertise and manual effort to develop the annotations and is subject to inconsistencies\
    \ in the annotation due to human errors. In this paper, we propose an alternative\
    \ approach to treebanking\u2014one that requires writing grammars. This approach\
    \ is motivated specifically in the context of Universal Dependencies, an effort\
    \ to develop uniform and cross-lingually consistent treebanks across multiple\
    \ languages. We show here that a bootstrapping approach to treebanking via interlingual\
    \ grammars is plausible and useful in a process where grammar engineering and\
    \ treebanking are jointly pursued when creating resources for the target language.\
    \ We demonstrate the usefulness of synthetic treebanks in the task of delexicalized\
    \ parsing. Our experiments reveal that simple models for treebank generation are\
    \ cheaper than human annotated treebanks, especially in the lower ends of the\
    \ learning curves for delexicalized parsing, which is relevant in particular in\
    \ the context of low-resource languages."

  abstract: More and more evidence is appearing that integrating symbolic lexical
    knowledge into neural models aids learning. This contrasts the widely-held belief
    that neural networks largely learn their own feature representations. For example,
    recent work has shows benefits of integrating lexicons to aid cross-lingual part-of-speech
    (PoS). However, little is known on how complementary such additional information
    is, and to what extent improvements depend on the coverage and quality of these
    external resources. This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough
    analysis on the contributions of lexical resources for cross-lingual PoS tagging
    in neural times.

  abstract: This paper investigates the presence of gender bias in pretrained Swedish
    embeddings. We focus on a scenario where names are matched with occupations, and
    we demonstrate how a number of standard pretrained embeddings handle this task.
    Our experiments show some significant differences between the pretrained embeddings,
    with word-based methods showing the most bias and contextualized language models
    showing the least. We also demonstrate that the previously proposed debiasing
    method does not affect the performance of the various embeddings in this scenario.

  abstract: Determining how words have changed their meaning is an important topic
    in Natural Language Processing. However, evaluations of methods to characterise
    such change have been limited to small, handcrafted resources. We introduce an
    English evaluation set which is larger, more varied, and more realistic than seen
    to date, with terms derived from a historical thesaurus. Moreover, the dataset
    is unique in that it represents change as a shift from the term of interest to
    a WordNet synset. Using the synset lemmas, we can use this set to evaluate (standard)
    methods that detect change between word pairs, as well as (adapted) methods that
    detect the change between a term and a sense overall. We show that performance
    on the new data set is much lower than earlier reported findings, setting a new
    standard.

  abstract: We apply hyperbolic embeddings to trace the dynamics of change of conceptual-semantic
    relationships in a large diachronic scientific corpus (200 years). Our focus is
    on emerging scientific fields and the increasingly specialized terminology establishing
    around them. Reproducing high-quality hierarchical structures such as WordNet
    on a diachronic scale is a very difficult task. Hyperbolic embeddings can map
    partial graphs into low dimensional, continuous hierarchical spaces, making more
    explicit the latent structure of the input. We show that starting from simple
    lists of word pairs (rather than a list of entities with directional links) it
    is possible to build diachronic hierarchical semantic spaces which allow us to
    model a process towards specialization for selected scientific fields.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of enhancing lexical embeddings
    in LSTM language models (LM) with syntactic and semantic representations. We evaluate
    the language models using perplexity, and we evaluate the performance of the models
    on the task of predicting human sentence acceptability judgments. We train LSTM
    language models on sentences automatically annotated with universal syntactic
    dependency roles (Nivre, 2016), dependency depth and universal semantic tags (Abzianidze
    et al., 2017) to predict sentence acceptability judgments. Our experiments indicate
    that syntactic tags lower perplexity, while semantic tags increase it. Our experiments
    also show that neither syntactic nor semantic tags improve the performance of
    LSTM language models on the task of predicting sentence acceptability judgments.

  abstract: In this paper, we compare the use of linear versus neural classifiers
    in a greedy transition system for MWE identification. Both our linear and neural
    models achieve a new state-of-the-art on the PARSEME 1.1 shared task data sets,
    comprising 20 languages. Surprisingly, our best model is a simple feed-forward
    network with one hidden layer, although more sophisticated (recurrent) architectures
    were tested. The feedback from this study is that tuning a SVM is rather straightforward,
    whereas tuning our neural system revealed more challenging. Given the number of
    languages and the variety of linguistic phenomena to handle for the MWE identification
    task, we have designed an accurate tuning procedure, and we show that hyperparameters
    are better selected by using a majority-vote within random search configurations
    rather than a simple best configuration selection. Although the performance is
    rather good (better than both the best shared task system and the average of the
    best per-language results), further work is needed to improve the generalization
    power, especially on unseen MWEs.

  abstract: This paper analyzes results on light-verb construction identification
    from the PARSEME shared-task, distinguishing between simple cases that could be
    directly learned from training data from more complex cases that require an extra
    level of semantic processing. We propose a simple baseline that beats the state
    of the art for the simple cases, and couple it with another simple baseline to
    handle the complex cases. We additionally present two other classifiers based
    on a richer set of features, with results surpassing the state of the art by 8
    percentage points.

  abstract: "We explore the effectiveness of four feature representations \u2013 bag-of-words,\
    \ word embeddings, principal components and autoencoders \u2013 for the binary\
    \ categorization of the easy-to-read variety vs standard language. Standard language\

    \ Results show that bag-of-words is a robust and straightforward feature representation\

  abstract: Affordances denote actions that can be performed in the presence of different
    objects, or possibility of action in an environment. In robotic systems, affordances
    and actions may suffer from poor semantic generalization capabilities due to the
    high amount of required hand-crafted specifications. To alleviate this issue,
    we propose a method to mine for object-action pairs in free text corpora, successively
    training and evaluating different prediction models of affordance based on word
    embeddings.

  abstract: We present our work towards developing a system that should find, in a
    large text corpus, contiguous phrases expressing similar meaning as a query phrase
    of arbitrary length. Depending on the use case, this task can be seen as a form
    of (phrase-level) query rewriting. The suggested approach works in a generative
    manner, is unsupervised and uses a combination of a semantic word n-gram model,
    a statistical language model and a document search engine. A central component
    is a distributional semantic model containing word n-grams vectors (or embeddings)
    which models semantic similarities between n-grams of different order. As data
    we use a large corpus of PubMed abstracts. The presented experiment is based on
    manual evaluation of extracted phrases for arbitrary queries provided by a group
    of evaluators. The results indicate that the proposed approach is promising and
    that the use of distributional semantic models trained with uni-, bi- and trigrams
    seems to work better than a more traditional unigram model.

  abstract: We present ParIce, a new English-Icelandic parallel corpus. This is the
    first parallel corpus built for the purposes of language technology development
    and research for Icelandic, although some Icelandic texts can be found in various
    other multilingual parallel corpora. We map out which Icelandic texts are available
    for these purposes, collect aligned data and align other bilingual texts we acquired.
    We describe the alignment process and how we filter the data to weed out noise
    and bad alignments. In total we collected 43 million Icelandic words in 4.3 million
    aligned segment pairs, but after filtering, our corpus includes 38.8 million Icelandic
    words in 3.5 million segment pairs. We estimate that approximately 5% of the corpus
    data is noise or faulty alignments while more than 50% of the segments we deleted
    were faulty. We estimate that our filtering process reduced the number of faulty
    segments in the corpus by more than 60% while only reducing the number of good
    alignments by approximately 8%.

  abstract: This paper presents an overview of the available linguistic resources
    for the Sakha language, and presents new tools for supporting language learning
    for Sakha. The essential resources include a morphological analyzer, digital dictionaries,
    and corpora of Sakha texts. Based on these resources, we implement a language-learning
    environment for Sakha in the Revita CALL platform. We extended an earlier, preliminary
    version of the morphological analyzer/transducer, built on the Apertium finite-state
    platform. The analyzer currently has an adequate level of coverage, between 86%
    and 89% on two Sakha corpora. Revita is a freely available online language learning
    platform for learners beyond the beginner level. We describe the tools for Sakha
    currently integrated into the Revita platform. To the best of our knowledge, at
    present, this is the first large-scale project undertaken to support intermediate-advanced
    learners of a minority Siberian language.

  abstract: This paper explores the use of multi-task learning (MTL) for incorporating
    external knowledge in neural models. Specifically, we show how MTL can enable
    a BiLSTM sentiment classifier to incorporate information from sentiment lexicons.
    Our MTL set-up is shown to improve model performance (compared to a single-task
    set-up) on both English and Norwegian sentence-level sentiment datasets. The paper
    also introduces a new sentiment lexicon for Norwegian.

  abstract: "Sentiment analysis has become very popular in both research and business\
    \ due to the increasing amount of opinionated text from Internet users. Standard\
    \ sentiment analysis deals with classifying the overall sentiment of a text, but\
    \ this doesn\u2019t include other important information such as towards which\
    \ entity, topic or aspect within the text the sentiment is directed. Aspect-based\
    \ sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a more complex task that consists in identifying\
    \ both sentiments and aspects. This paper shows the potential of using the contextual\
    \ word representations from the pre-trained language model BERT, together with\
    \ a fine-tuning method with additional generated text, in order to solve out-of-domain\
    \ ABSA and outperform previous state-of-the-art results on SemEval-2015 Task 12\
    \ subtask 2 and SemEval-2016 Task 5. To the best of our knowledge, no other existing\
    \ work has been done on out-of-domain ABSA for aspect classification."

  abstract: The task of stance detection consists of classifying the opinion within
    a text towards some target. This paper seeks to generate a dataset of quotes from
    Danish politicians, label this dataset to allow the task of stance detection to
    be performed, and present annotation guidelines to allow further expansion of
    the generated dataset. Furthermore, three models based on an LSTM architecture
    are designed, implemented and optimized to perform the task of stance detection
    for the generated dataset. Experiments are performed using conditionality and
    bi-directionality for these models, and using either singular word embeddings
    or averaged word embeddings for an entire quote, to determine the optimal model
    design. The simplest model design, applying neither conditionality or bi-directionality,
    and averaged word embeddings across quotes, yields the strongest results. Furthermore,
    it was found that inclusion of the quotes politician, and the party affiliation
    of the quoted politician, greatly improved performance of the strongest model.

  abstract: The net is rife with rumours that spread through microblogs and social
    media. Not all the claims in these can be verified. However, recent work has shown
    that the stances alone that commenters take toward claims can be sufficiently
    good indicators of claim veracity, using e.g. an HMM that takes conversational
    stance sequences as the only input. Existing results are monolingual (English)
    and mono-platform (Twitter). This paper introduces a stance-annotated Reddit dataset
    for the Danish language, and describes various implementations of stance classification
    models. Of these, a Linear SVM provides predicts stance best, with 0.76 accuracy
    / 0.42 macro F1. Stance labels are then used to predict veracity across platforms
    and also across languages, training on conversations held in one language and
    using the model on conversations held in another. In our experiments, monolinugal
    scores reach stance-based veracity accuracy of 0.83 (F1 0.68); applying the model
    across languages predicts veracity of claims with an accuracy of 0.82 (F1 0.67).
    This demonstrates the surprising and powerful viability of transferring stance-based
    veracity prediction across languages.

  abstract: News articles such as sports game reports are often thought to closely
    follow the underlying game statistics, but in practice they contain a notable
    amount of background knowledge, interpretation, insight into the game, and quotes
    that are not present in the official statistics. This poses a challenge for automated
    data-to-text news generation with real-world news corpora as training data. We
    report on the development of a corpus of Finnish ice hockey news, edited to be
    suitable for training of end-to-end news generation methods, as well as demonstrate
    generation of text, which was judged by journalists to be relatively close to
    a viable product. The new dataset and system source code are available for research
    purposes.

  abstract: Cross-modality between vision and language is a key component for effective
    and efficient communication, and human language processing mechanism successfully
    integrates information from various modalities to extract the intended meaning.
    However, incomplete linguistic input, i.e. due to a noisy environment, is one
    of the challenges for a successful communication. In that case, an incompleteness
    in one channel can be compensated by information from another one. In this paper,
    by conducting visual-world paradigm, we investigated the dynamics between syntactically
    possible gap fillers and the visual arrangements in incomplete German sentences
    and their effect on overall sentence interpretation.

  abstract: In this paper we introduce a new natural language processing dataset and
    benchmark for predicting prosodic prominence from written text. To our knowledge
    this will be the largest publicly available dataset with prosodic labels. We describe
    the dataset construction and the resulting benchmark dataset in detail and train
    a number of different models ranging from feature-based classifiers to neural
    network systems for the prediction of discretized prosodic prominence. We show
    that pre-trained contextualized word representations from BERT outperform the
    other models even with less than 10% of the training data. Finally we discuss
    the dataset in light of the results and point to future research and plans for
    further improving both the dataset and methods of predicting prosodic prominence
    from text. The dataset and the code for the models will be made publicly available.

  abstract: We consider cross- and multilingual text classification approaches to
    the identification of online registers (genres), i.e. text varieties with specific
    situational characteristics. Register is the most important predictor of linguistic
    variation, and register information could improve the potential of online data
    for many applications. We introduce the first manually annotated non-English corpus
    of online registers featuring the full range of linguistic variation found online.
    The data set consists of 2,237 Finnish documents and follows the register taxonomy
    developed for the Corpus of Online Registers of English (CORE). Using CORE and
    the newly introduced corpus, we demonstrate the feasibility of cross-lingual register
    identification using a simple approach based on convolutional neural networks
    and multilingual word embeddings. We further find that register identification
    results can be improved through multilingual training even when a substantial
    number of annotations is available in the target language.

  abstract: We present a system for Natural Language Inference which uses a dynamic
    semantics converter from abstract syntax trees to Coq types. It combines the fine-grainedness
    of a dynamic semantics system with the powerfulness of a state-of-the-art proof
    assistant, like Coq. We evaluate the system on all sections of the FraCaS test
    suite, excluding section 6. This is the first system that does a complete run
    on the anaphora and ellipsis sections of the FraCaS. It has a better overall accuracy
    than any previous system.

  abstract: We investigate different ensemble learning techniques for neural morphological
    inflection using bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder models with attention. We
    experiment with weighted and unweighted majority voting and bagging. We find that
    all investigated ensemble methods lead to improved accuracy over a baseline of
    a single model. However, contrary to expectation based on earlier work by Najafi
    et al. (2018) and Silfverberg et al. (2017), weighting does not deliver clear
    benefits. Bagging was found to underperform plain voting ensembles in general.

  abstract: Lemmatization, finding the basic morphological form of a word in a corpus,
    is an important step in many natural language processing tasks when working with
    morphologically rich languages. We describe and evaluate Nefnir, a new open source
    lemmatizer for Icelandic. Nefnir uses suffix substitution rules, derived from
    a large morphological database, to lemmatize tagged text. Evaluation shows that
    for correctly tagged text, Nefnir obtains an accuracy of 99.55%, and for text
    tagged with a PoS tagger, the accuracy obtained is 96.88%.

  abstract: 'Social science researchers often use text as the raw data in investigations:
    for instance, when investigating the effects of IMF policies on the development
    of countries under IMF programs, researchers typically encode structured descriptions
    of the programs using a time-consuming manual effort. Making this process automatic
    may open up new opportunities in scaling up such investigations. As a first step
    towards automatizing this coding process, we describe an experiment where we apply
    a sentence classifier that automatically detects mentions of policy conditions
    in IMF loan agreements and divides them into different types. The results show
    that the classifier is generally able to detect the policy conditions, although
    some types are hard to distinguish.'

  abstract: In this paper, we present a prototype for an online exercise aimed at
    learners of English and Swedish that serves multiple purposes. The exercise allows
    learners of the aforementioned languages to train their knowledge of particle
    verbs receiving clues from the exercise application. The user themselves decide
    which clue to receive and pay in virtual currency for each, which provides us
    with valuable information about the utility of the clues that we provide as well
    as the learners willingness to trade virtual currency versus accuracy of their
    choice. As resources, we use list with annotated levels from the proficiency scale
    defined by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) and a multilingual
    corpus with syntactic dependency relations and word annotation for all language
    pairs. From the latter resource, we extract translation equivalents for particle
    verb construction together with a list of parallel corpus examples that can be
    used as clues in the exercise.

  abstract: In this paper we present a new method to learn a model robust to typos
    for a Named Entity Recognition task. Our improvement over existing methods helps
    the model to take into account the context of the sentence inside a justice decision
    in order to recognize an entity with a typo. We used state-of-the-art models and
    enriched the last layer of the neural network with high-level information linked
    with the potential of the word to be a certain type of entity. More precisely,
    we utilized the similarities between the word and the potential entity candidates
    the tagged sentence context. The experiments on a dataset of french justice decisions
    show a reduction of the relative F1-score error of 32%, upgrading the score obtained
    with the most competitive fine-tuned state-of-the-art system from 94.85% to 96.52%.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to natural language semantics.
    Our main focus is on the inference task in an environment where judgments require
    probabilistic reasoning. We treat nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. as unary predicates,
    and we model them as boxes in a bounded domain. We apply Bayesian learning to
    satisfy constraints expressed as premises. In this way we construct a model, by
    specifying boxes for the predicates. The probability of the hypothesis (the conclusion)
    is evaluated against the model that incorporates the premises as constraints.

  abstract: Endangered Uralic languages present a high variety of inflectional forms
    in their morphology. This results in a high number of homonyms in inflections,
    which introduces a lot of morphological ambiguity in sentences. Previous research
    has employed constraint grammars to address this problem, however CGs are often
    unable to fully disambiguate a sentence, and their development is labour intensive.
    We present an LSTM based model for automatically ranking morphological readings
    of sentences based on their quality. This ranking can be used to evaluate the
    existing CG disambiguators or to directly morphologically disambiguate sentences.
    Our approach works on a morphological abstraction and it can be trained with a
    very small dataset.

  abstract: 'This paper describes an evaluation of five data-driven part-of-speech
    (PoS) taggers for spoken Norwegian. The taggers all rely on different machine
    learning mechanisms: decision trees, hidden Markov models (HMMs), conditional
    random fields (CRFs), long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), and convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs). We go into some of the challenges posed by the task of
    tagging spoken, as opposed to written, language, and in particular a wide range
    of dialects as is found in the recordings of the LIA (Language Infrastructure
    made Accessible) project. The results show that the taggers based on either conditional
    random fields or neural networks perform much better than the rest, with the LSTM
    tagger getting the highest score.'

  abstract: 'We report on work in progress which consists of annotating an Icelandic
    corpus for named entities (NEs) and using it for training a named entity recognizer
    based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model. Currently, we have annotated
    7,538 NEs appearing in the first 200,000 tokens of a 1 million token corpus, MIM-GOLD,
    originally developed for serving as a gold standard for part-of-speech tagging.
    Our best performing model, trained on this subset of MIM-GOLD, and enriched with
    external word embeddings, obtains an overall F1 score of 81.3% when categorizing
    NEs into the following four categories: persons, locations, organizations and
    miscellaneous. Our preliminary results are promising, especially given the fact
    that 80% of MIM-GOLD has not yet been used for training.'

  abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) has greatly advanced by the introduction
    of deep neural architectures. However, the success of these methods depends on
    large amounts of training data. The scarcity of publicly-available human-labeled
    datasets has resulted in limited evaluation of existing NER systems, as is the
    case for Danish. This paper studies the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer
    for Danish, evaluates its complementarity to limited gold data, and sheds light
    on performance of Danish NER.

  abstract: "The use of a linking element between compound members is a common phenomenon\
    \ in Germanic languages. Still, the exact use and conditioning of such elements\
    \ is a disputed topic in linguistics. In this paper we address the issue of predicting\
    \ the use of linking elements in Danish. Following previous research that shows\
    \ how the choice of linking element might be conditioned by phonology, we frame\
    \ the problem as a language modeling task: Considering the linking elements -s/-\u2205\
    \ the problem becomes predicting what is most probable to encounter next, a syllable\
    \ boundary or the joining element, \u2018s\u2019. We show that training a language\
    \ model on this task reaches an accuracy of 94 %, and in the case of an unsupervised\
    \ model, the accuracy reaches 80%."

  abstract: This article is a report from an ongoing project aiming at analyzing lexical
    and grammatical competences of Swedish as a Second language (L2). To facilitate
    lexical analysis, we need access to metalinguistic information about relevant
    vocabulary that L2 learners can use and understand. The focus of the current article
    is on the lexical annotation of the vocabulary scope for a range of lexicographical
    aspects, such as morphological analysis, valency, types of multi-word units, etc.
    We perform parts of the analysis automatically, and other parts manually. The
    rationale behind this is that where there is no possibility to add information
    automatically, manual effort needs to be added. To facilitate the latter, a tool
    LEGATO has been designed, implemented and currently put to active testing.

  abstract: This paper presents a flexible and powerful system for creating parallel
    corpora and for running neural machine translation services. Our package provides
    a scalable data repository backend that offers transparent data pre-processing
    pipelines and automatic alignment procedures that facilitate the compilation of
    extensive parallel data sets from a variety of sources. Moreover, we develop a
    web-based interface that constitutes an intuitive frontend for end-users of the
    platform. The whole system can easily be distributed over virtual machines and
    implements a sophisticated permission system with secure connections and a flexible
    database for storing arbitrary metadata. Furthermore, we also provide an interface
    for neural machine translation that can run as a service on virtual machines,
    which also incorporates a connection to the data repository software.

  abstract: We present a new method for preparing a lexical-phonetic database as a
    resource for acoustic model training. The research is an offshoot of the ongoing
    Project Ravnur (Speech Recognition for Faroese), but the method is language-independent.
    At NODALIDA 2019 we demonstrate the method (called SHARP) online, showing how
    a traditional lexical-phonetic dictionary (with a very rich phone inventory) is
    transformed into an ASR-friendly database (with reduced phonetics, preventing
    data sparseness). The mapping procedure is informed by a corpus of speech transcripts.
    We conclude with a discussion on the benefits of a well-thought-out BLARK design
    (Basic Language Resource Kit), making tools like SHARP possible.

  abstract: The availability of user-generated content has increased significantly
    over time. Wikipedia is one example of a corpora which spans a huge range of topics
    and is freely available. Storing and processing these corpora requires flexible
    documents models as they may contain malicious and incorrect data. Docria is a
    library which attempts to address this issue by providing a solution which can
    be used with small to large corpora, from laptops using Python interactively in
    a Jupyter notebook to clusters running map-reduce frameworks with optimized compiled
    code. Docria is available as open-source code.

  abstract: This paper describes the design and use of the graph-based parsing framework
    and toolkit UniParse, released as an open-source python software package. UniParse
    as a framework novelly streamlines research prototyping, development and evaluation
    of graph-based dependency parsing architectures. UniParse does this by enabling
    highly efficient, sufficiently independent, easily readable, and easily extensible
    implementations for all dependency parser components. We distribute the toolkit
    with ready-made configurations as re-implementations of all current state-of-the-art
    first-order graph-based parsers, including even more efficient Cython implementations
    of both encoders and decoders, as well as the required specialised loss functions.

  abstract: 'Defining words in a textual context is a useful task both for practical
    purposes and for gaining insight into distributed word representations. Building
    on the distributional hypothesis, we argue here that the most natural formalization
    of definition modeling is to treat it as a sequence-to-sequence task, rather than
    a word-to-sequence task: given an input sequence with a highlighted word, generate
    a contextually appropriate definition for it. We implement this approach in a
    Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model. Our proposal allows to train contextualization
    and definition generation in an end-to-end fashion, which is a conceptual improvement
    over earlier works. We achieve state-of-the-art results both in contextual and
    non-contextual definition modeling.'

  abstract: We extend a state-of-the-art deep neural architecture for semantic dependency
    parsing with features defined over syntactic dependency trees. Our empirical results
    show that only gold-standard syntactic information leads to consistent improvements
    in semantic parsing accuracy, and that the magnitude of these improvements varies
    with the specific combination of the syntactic and the semantic representation
    used. In contrast, automatically predicted syntax does not seem to help semantic
    parsing. Our error analysis suggests that there is a significant overlap between
    syntactic and semantic representations.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we critically evaluate the widespread assumption that
    deep learning NLP models do not require lemmatized input. To test this, we trained
    versions of contextualised word embedding ELMo models on raw tokenized corpora
    and on the corpora with word tokens replaced by their lemmas. Then, these models
    were evaluated on the word sense disambiguation task. This was done for the English
    and Russian languages. The experiments showed that while lemmatization is indeed
    not necessary for English, the situation is different for Russian. It seems that
    for rich-morphology languages, using lemmatized training and testing data yields
    small but consistent improvements: at least for word sense disambiguation. This
    means that the decisions about text pre-processing before training ELMo should
    consider the linguistic nature of the language in question.'

  abstract: 'The multilingual BERT model is trained on 104 languages and meant to
    serve as a universal language model and tool for encoding sentences. We explore
    how well the model performs on several languages across several tasks: a diagnostic
    classification probing the embeddings for a particular syntactic property, a cloze
    task testing the language modelling ability to fill in gaps in a sentence, and
    a natural language generation task testing for the ability to produce coherent
    text fitting a given context. We find that the currently available multilingual
    BERT model is clearly inferior to the monolingual counterparts, and cannot in
    many cases serve as a substitute for a well-trained monolingual model. We find
    that the English and German models perform well at generation, whereas the multilingual
    model is lacking, in particular, for Nordic languages. The code of the experiments

  abstract: Due to the differences between reviews in different product categories,
    creating a general model for cross-domain sentiment classification can be a difficult
    task. This paper proposes an architecture that incorporates domain knowledge into
    a neural sentiment classification model. In addition to providing a cross-domain
    model, this also provides a quantifiable representation of the domains as numeric
    vectors. We show that it is possible to cluster the domain vectors and provide
    qualitative insights into the inter-domain relations. We also a) present a new
    data set for sentiment classification that includes a domain parameter and preprocessed
    data points, and b) perform an ablation study in order to determine whether some
    word groups impact performance.

  abstract: "This paper discusses methods to improve the performance of text classification\
    \ on data that is difficult to classify due to a large number of unbalanced classes\
    \ with noisy examples. A variety of features are tested, in combination with three\
    \ different neural-network-based methods with increasing complexity. The classifiers\
    \ are applied to a songtext\u2013artist dataset which is large, unbalanced and\
    \ noisy. We come to the conclusion that substantial improvement can be obtained\
    \ by removing unbalancedness and sparsity from the data. This fulfils a classification\
    \ task unsatisfactorily\u2014however, with contemporary methods, it is a practical\
    \ step towards fairly satisfactory results."

    \ delivers the best translation performance for eBay Customer Service content.\
    \ It will lay out the timeline, process and mechanisms used to customise Neural\
    \ MT models and how these were used in conjunction with Human Based evaluations\
    \ to determine which approach to Neural MT provided the best translation outcomes.The\
    \ tutorial will cover the following topics and methods:- Structural differences\
    \ in Neural Networks and how they assist the language decoding process \u2013\
    \ RNN, CNN and TNN will be covered in detailed.- Customisation of Neural MT using\

  abstract: "Most of the test sets used for the evaluation of MT systems reflect the\
    \ frequency distribution of different phenomena found in naturally occurring data\
    \ (\u201Dstandard\u201D or \u201Dnatural\u201D test sets). However, to better\
    \ understand particular strengths and weaknesses of MT systems, especially those\
    \ based on neural networks, it is necessary to apply more focused evaluation procedures.\
    \ Therefore, another type of test sets (\u201Dchallenge\u201D test sets, also\
    \ called \u201Dtest suites\u201D) is being increasingly employed in order to highlight\
    \ points of difficulty which are relevant to model development, training, or using\
    \ of the given system. This tutorial will be useful for anyone (researchers, developers,\
    \ users, translators) interested in detailed evaluation and getting a better understanding\
    \ of machine translation (MT) systems and models. The attendees will learn about\
    \ the motivation and linguistic background of challenge test sets and a range\
    \ of testing possibilities applied to the state-of-the-art MT systems, as well\
    \ as a number of practical aspects and challenges."

  abstract: 'In the last couple of years, machine translation technology has seen
    major changes with the breakthrough of neural machine translation (NMT), a growing
    number of providers and translation platforms. Machine Translation generally is
    experiencing a peak in demand from translation buyers, thanks to Machine Learning
    and AI being omnipresent in the media and at industry events. At the same time,
    new models for defining translation quality are becoming more widely adopted.
    These changes have profound implications for translators, LSPs and translation
    buyers: translators have to adjust their post-editing approaches, while LSPs and
    translation buyers are faced with decisions on selecting providers, best approaches
    for updating MT systems, financial investments, integrating tools, and getting
    the timing for implementation right for an optimum ROI.In this tutorial on MT
    and post-editing we would like to continue sharing the latest trends in the field
    of MT technologies, and discuss their impact on post-editing practices as well
    as integrating MT on large, multi-language translation programs. We will look
    at tool compatibility, different use cases of MT and dynamic quality models, and
    share our experience of measuring performance.'

  abstract: 'The tutorial will introduce a set of very useful statistical tests for
    conducting analyses in the research areas of Machine Translation (MT) and Translation
    Studies (TS). For each statistical test, the presenter will: 1) introduce it in
    the context of a common research example that pertains to the area of MT and/or
    TS 2) explain the technique behind the test and its assumptions 3) cover common
    pitfalls when the test is applied in research studies, and 4) conduct a hands-on
    activity so that attendees can put the knowledge acquired in practice straight-away.
    All examples and exercises will be in R. The following statistical tests will
    be covered: t-tests (both parametric and non-parametric), bootstrap resampling,
    Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, linear mixed-effects models.'

  abstract: Neural generation methods for task-oriented dialogue typically generate
    from a meaning representation that is populated using a database of domain information,
    such as a table of data describing a restaurant. While earlier work focused solely
    on the semantic fidelity of outputs, recent work has started to explore methods
    for controlling the style of the generated text while simultaneously achieving
    semantic accuracy. Here we experiment with two stylistic benchmark tasks, generating
    language that exhibits variation in personality, and generating discourse contrast.
    We report a huge performance improvement in both stylistic control and semantic
    accuracy over the state of the art on both of these benchmarks. We test several
    different models and show that putting stylistic conditioning in the decoder and
    eliminating the semantic re-ranker used in earlier models results in more than
    15 points higher BLEU for Personality, with a reduction of semantic error to near
    zero. We also report an improvement from .75 to .81 in controlling contrast and
    a reduction in semantic error from 16% to 2%.

  abstract: Previous work on visual storytelling mainly focused on exploring image
    sequence as evidence for storytelling and neglected textual evidence for guiding
    story generation. Motivated by human storytelling process which recalls stories
    for familiar images, we exploit textual evidence from similar images to help generate
    coherent and meaningful stories. To pick the images which may provide textual
    experience, we propose a two-step ranking method based on image object recognition
    techniques. To utilize textual information, we design an extended Seq2Seq model
    with two-channel encoder and attention. Experiments on the VIST dataset show that
    our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models without heavy engineering.

  abstract: "The move from pipeline Natural Language Generation (NLG) approaches to\
    \ neural end-to-end approaches led to a loss of control in sentence planning operations\
    \ owing to the conflation of intermediary micro-planning stages into a single\
    \ model. Such control is highly necessary when the text should be tailored to\
    \ respect some constraints such as which entity to be mentioned first, the entity\
    \ position, the complexity of sentences, etc. In this paper, we introduce fine-grained\
    \ control of sentence planning in neural data-to-text generation models at two\
    \ levels - realization of input entities in desired sentences and realization\
    \ of the input entities in the desired position among individual sentences. We\
    \ show that by augmenting the input with explicit position identifiers, the neural\
    \ model can achieve a great control over the output structure while keeping the\
    \ naturalness of the generated text intact. Since sentence level metrics are not\
    \ entirely suitable to evaluate this task, we used a metric specific to our task\
    \ that accounts for the model\u2019s ability to achieve control. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the position identifiers do constraint the neural model to respect the\
    \ intended output structure which can be useful in a variety of domains that require\
    \ the generated text to be in a certain structure."

  abstract: Due to the absence of labeled data, discourse parsing still remains challenging
    in some languages. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method to
    conduct zero-shot Chinese text-level dependency parsing by leveraging English
    discourse labeled data and parsing techniques. We first construct the Chinese-English
    mapping from the level of sentence and elementary discourse unit (EDU), and then
    exploit the parsing results of the corresponding English translations to obtain
    the discourse trees for the Chinese text. This method can automatically conduct
    Chinese discourse parsing, with no need of a large scale of Chinese labeled data.

  abstract: "When generating technical instructions, it is often necessary to describe\
    \ an object that does not exist yet. For example, an NLG system which explains\
    \ how to build a house needs to generate sentences like \u201Cbuild *a wall of\
    \ height five to your left*\u201D and \u201Cnow build *a wall on the other side*.\u201D\
    \ Generating (indefinite) referring expressions to objects that do not exist yet\
    \ is fundamentally different from generating the usual definite referring expressions,\
    \ because the new object must be distinguished from an infinite set of possible\
    \ alternatives. We formalize this problem and present an algorithm for generating\
    \ such expressions, in the context of generating building instructions within\
    \ the Minecraft video game."

  abstract: 'We model the production of quantified referring expressions (QREs) that
    identify collections of visual items. To address this task, we propose a method
    of perceptual cost pruning, which consists of two steps: (1) determine what subset
    of quantity information can be perceived given a time limit t, and (2) apply a
    preference order based REG algorithm (e.g., the Incremental Algorithm) to this
    reduced set of information. We demonstrate that this method successfully improves
    the human-likeness of the IA in the QRE generation task and successfully models
    human-generated language in most cases.'

  abstract: In recent years, Bayesian models of referring expression generation have
    gained prominence in order to produce situationally more adequate referring expressions.
    Basically, these models enable the integration of different parameters into the
    decision process for using a specific referring expression like the cardinality
    of the object set, the configuration and complexity of the visual field, and the
    discriminatory power of available attributes that need to be combined with visual
    salience and personal preference. This paper describes and discusses the results
    of an empirical study on the production of referring expressions in visual fields
    with different object configurations of varying complexity and different contextual
    premises for using a referring expression. The visual fields are set up using
    data from the TUNA experiment with plain random or pragmatically enriched configurations
    which allow for target inference. Different categories of the situational contexts,
    in which the referring expressions are produced, provide different degrees of
    cooperativeness, so that generation quality and its relations to contextual user
    intention can be observed. The results of the study suggest that Bayesian approaches
    must integrate individual generation preference and the cooperativeness of the
    situational task in order to model the broad variance between speakers more adequately.

  abstract: 'Text attribute transfer is modifying certain linguistic attributes (e.g.
    sentiment, style, author-ship, etc.) of a sentence and transforming them from
    one type to another. In this paper, we aim to analyze and interpret what is changed
    during the transfer process. We start from the observation that in many existing
    models and datasets, certain words within a sentence play important roles in determining
    the sentence attribute class. These words are referred as the Pivot Words. Based
    on these pivot words, we propose a lexical analysis framework, the Pivot Analysis,
    to quantitatively analyze the effects of these words in text attribute classification
    and transfer. We apply this framework to existing datasets and models and show
    that: (1) the pivot words are strong features for the classification of sentence
    attributes; (2) to change the attribute of a sentence, many datasets only requires
    to change certain pivot words; (3) consequently, many transfer models only perform
    the lexical-level modification,while leaving higher-level sentence structures
    unchanged. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of linguistic attribute
    transfer and further identifies the future requirements and challenges of this
    task'

  abstract: "Between 80% and 90% of all Chinese words have long and short form such\
    \ as \u8001\u864E/\u864E (lao-hu/hu , tiger) (Duanmu:2013). Consequently, the\
    \ choice between long and short forms is a key problem for lexical choice across\
    \ NLP and NLG. Following an earlier work on abbreviations in English (Mahowald\
    \ et al, 2013), we bring a probabilistic perspective to these questions, using\
    \ both a behavioral and a corpus-based approach. We hypothesized that there is\
    \ a higher probability of choosing short form in supportive context than in neutral\
    \ context in Mandarin. Consistent with our prediction, our findings revealed that\
    \ predictability of contexts makes effect on speakers\u2019 long and short form\

  abstract: The writing process consists of several stages such as drafting, revising,
    editing, and proofreading. Studies on writing assistance, such as grammatical
    error correction (GEC), have mainly focused on sentence editing and proofreading,
    where surface-level issues such as typographical errors, spelling errors, or grammatical
    errors should be corrected. We broaden this focus to include the earlier revising
    stage, where sentences require adjustment to the information included or major
    rewriting and propose Sentence-level Revision (SentRev) as a new writing assistance
    task. Well-performing systems in this task can help inexperienced authors by producing
    fluent, complete sentences given their rough, incomplete drafts. We build a new
    freely available crowdsourced evaluation dataset consisting of incomplete sentences
    authored by non-native writers paired with their final versions extracted from
    published academic papers for developing and evaluating SentRev models. We also
    establish baseline performance on SentRev using our newly built evaluation dataset.

  abstract: "Synthesis approaches in computational argumentation so far are restricted\
    \ to generating claim-like argument units or short summaries of debates. Ultimately,\
    \ however, we expect computers to generate whole new arguments for a given stance\
    \ towards some topic, backing up claims following argumentative and rhetorical\
    \ considerations. In this paper, we approach such an argumentation synthesis as\
    \ a language modeling task. In our language model, argumentative discourse units\
    \ are the \u201Cwords\u201D, and arguments represent the \u201Csentences\u201D\
    . Given a pool of units for any unseen topic-stance pair, the model selects a\
    \ set of unit types according to a basic rhetorical strategy (logos vs. pathos),\
    \ arranges the structure of the types based on the units\u2019 argumentative roles,\
    \ and finally \u201Cphrases\u201D an argument by instantiating the structure with\
    \ semantically coherent units from the pool. Our evaluation suggests that the\
    \ model can, to some extent, mimic the human synthesis of strategy-specific arguments."

  abstract: "Encoder-decoder based neural architectures serve as the basis of state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches in end-to-end open domain dialog systems. Since most of such systems\
    \ are trained with a maximum likelihood (MLE) objective they suffer from issues\
    \ such as lack of generalizability and the generic response problem, i.e., a system\
    \ response that can be an answer to a large number of user utterances, e.g., \u201C\
    Maybe, I don\u2019t know.\u201D Having explicit feedback on the relevance and\
    \ interestingness of a system response at each turn can be a useful signal for\
    \ mitigating such issues and improving system quality by selecting responses from\
    \ different approaches. Towards this goal, we present a system that evaluates\
    \ chatbot responses at each dialog turn for coherence and engagement. Our system\
    \ provides explicit turn-level dialog quality feedback, which we show to be highly\
    \ correlated with human evaluation. To show that incorporating this feedback in\
    \ the neural response generation models improves dialog quality, we present two\
    \ different and complementary mechanisms to incorporate explicit feedback into\
    \ a neural response generation model: reranking and direct modification of the\
    \ loss function during training. Our studies show that a response generation model\
    \ that incorporates these combined feedback mechanisms produce more engaging and\
    \ coherent responses in an open-domain spoken dialog setting, significantly improving\
    \ the response quality using both automatic and human evaluation."

  abstract: 'We investigate the impact of search strategies in neural dialogue modeling.
    We first compare two standard search algorithms, greedy and beam search, as well
    as our newly proposed iterative beam search which produces a more diverse set
    of candidate responses. We evaluate these strategies in realistic full conversations
    with humans and propose a model-based Bayesian calibration to address annotator
    bias. These conversations are analyzed using two automatic metrics: log-probabilities
    assigned by the model and utterance diversity. Our experiments reveal that better
    search algorithms lead to higher rated conversations. However, finding the optimal
    selection mechanism to choose from a more diverse set of candidates is still an
    open question.'

  abstract: To overcome the limitations of automated metrics (e.g. BLEU, METEOR) for
    evaluating dialogue systems, researchers typically use human judgments to provide
    convergent evidence. While it has been demonstrated that human judgments can suffer
    from the inconsistency of ratings, extant research has also found that the design
    of the evaluation task affects the consistency and quality of human judgments.
    We conduct a between-subjects study to understand the impact of four experiment
    conditions on human ratings of dialogue system output. In addition to discrete
    and continuous scale ratings, we also experiment with a novel application of Best-Worst
    scaling to dialogue evaluation. Through our systematic study with 40 crowdsourced
    workers in each task, we find that using continuous scales achieves more consistent
    ratings than Likert scale or ranking-based experiment design. Additionally, we
    find that factors such as time taken to complete the task and no prior experience
    of participating in similar studies of rating dialogue system output positively
    impact consistency and agreement amongst raters.

  abstract: Generating fluent natural language responses from structured semantic
    representations is a critical step in task-oriented conversational systems. Sequence-to-sequence
    models on flat meaning representations (MR) have been dominant in this task, for
    example in the E2E NLG Challenge. Previous work has shown that a tree-structured
    MR can improve the model for better discourse-level structuring and sentence-level
    planning. In this work, we propose a tree-to-sequence model that uses a tree-LSTM
    encoder to leverage the tree structures in the input MR, and further enhance the
    decoding by a structure-enhanced attention mechanism. In addition, we explore
    combining these enhancements with constrained decoding to improve semantic correctness.
    Our experiments not only show significant improvements over standard seq2seq baselines,
    but also is more data-efficient and generalizes better to hard scenarios.

  abstract: Multiple headlines of a newspaper article have an important role to express
    the content of the article accurately and concisely. A headline depends on the
    content and intent of their article. While a single headline expresses the whole
    corresponding article, each of multiple headlines expresses different information
    individually. We suggest automatic generation method of such a diverse multiple
    headlines in a newspaper. Our generation method is based on the Pointer-Generator
    Network, using page metadata on a newspaper which can change headline generation
    behavior. This page metadata includes headline location, headline size, article
    page number, etc. In a previous related work, ensemble of three different generation
    models was performed to obtain a single headline, where each generation model
    generates a single headline candidate. In contrast, we use a single model to generate
    multiple headlines. We conducted automatic evaluations for generated headlines.
    The results show that our method improved ROUGE-1 score by 4.32 points higher
    than baseline. These results suggest that our model using page metadata can generate
    various multiple headlines for an article In better performance.

  abstract: Question Generation (QG) is the task of generating questions from a given
    passage. One of the key requirements of QG is to generate a question such that
    it results in a target answer. Previous works used a target answer to obtain a
    desired question. However, we also want to specify how to ask questions and improve
    the quality of generated questions. In this study, we explore the use of interrogative
    phrases as additional sources to control QG. By providing interrogative phrases,
    we expect that QG can generate a more reliable sequence of words subsequent to
    an interrogative phrase. We present a baseline sequence-to-sequence model with
    the attention, copy, and coverage mechanisms, and show that the simple baseline
    achieves state-of-the-art performance. The experiments demonstrate that interrogative
    phrases contribute to improving the performance of QG. In addition, we report
    the superiority of using interrogative phrases in human evaluation. Finally, we
    show that a question answering system can provide target answers more correctly
    when the questions are generated with interrogative phrases.

  abstract: We compiled a new sentence splitting corpus that is composed of 203K pairs
    of aligned complex source and simplified target sentences. Contrary to previously
    proposed text simplification corpora, which contain only a small number of split
    examples, we present a dataset where each input sentence is broken down into a
    set of minimal propositions, i.e. a sequence of sound, self-contained utterances
    with each of them presenting a minimal semantic unit that cannot be further decomposed
    into meaningful propositions. This corpus is useful for developing sentence splitting
    approaches that learn how to transform sentences with a complex linguistic structure
    into a fine-grained representation of short sentences that present a simple and
    more regular structure which is easier to process for downstream applications
    and thus facilitates and improves their performance.

  abstract: Keyphrase generation is the task of predicting a set of lexical units
    that conveys the main content of a source text. Existing datasets for keyphrase
    generation are only readily available for the scholarly domain and include non-expert
    annotations. In this paper we present KPTimes, a large-scale dataset of news texts
    paired with editor-curated keyphrases. Exploring the dataset, we show how editors
    tag documents, and how their annotations differ from those found in existing datasets.
    We also train and evaluate state-of-the-art neural keyphrase generation models
    on KPTimes to gain insights on how well they perform on the news domain. The dataset
    is available online at https:// github.com/ygorg/KPTimes.

  abstract: A lot of recent work in Language & Vision has looked at generating descriptions
    or referring expressions for objects in scenes of real-world images, though focusing
    mostly on relatively simple language like object names, color and location attributes
    (e.g., brown chair on the left). This paper presents work on Draw-and-Tell, a
    dataset of detailed descriptions for common objects in images where annotators
    have produced fine-grained attribute-centric expressions distinguishing a target
    object from a range of similar objects. Additionally, the dataset comes with hand-drawn
    sketches for each object. As Draw-and-Tell is medium-sized and contains a rich
    vocabulary, it constitutes an interesting challenge for CNN-LSTM architectures
    used in state-of-the-art image captioning models. We explore whether the additional
    modality given through sketches can help such a model to learn to accurately ground
    detailed language referring expressions to object shapes. Our results are encouraging.

  abstract: 'Data-to-text generation aims to generate descriptions given a structured
    input data (i.e., a table with multiple records). Existing neural methods for
    encoding input data can be divided into two categories: a) pooling based encoders
    which ignore dependencies between input records or b) recurrent encoders which
    model only sequential dependencies between input records. In our investigation,
    although the recurrent encoder generally outperforms the pooling based encoder
    by learning the sequential dependencies, it is sensitive to the order of the input
    records (i.e., performance decreases when injecting the random shuffling noise
    over input data). To overcome this problem, we propose to adopt the self-attention
    mechanism to learn dependencies between arbitrary input records. Experimental
    results show the proposed method achieves comparable results and remains stable
    under random shuffling over input data.'

  abstract: Leveraging the visual modality effectively for Neural Machine Translation
    (NMT) remains an open problem in computational linguistics. Recently, Caglayan
    et al. posit that the observed gains are limited mainly due to the very simple,
    short, repetitive sentences of the Multi30k dataset (the only multimodal MT dataset
    available at the time), which renders the source text sufficient for context.
    In this work, we further investigate this hypothesis on a new large scale multimodal
    Machine Translation (MMT) dataset, How2, which has 1.57 times longer mean sentence
    length than Multi30k and no repetition. We propose and evaluate three novel fusion
    techniques, each of which is designed to ensure the utilization of visual context
    at different stages of the Sequence-to-Sequence transduction pipeline, even under
    full linguistic context. However, we still obtain only marginal gains under full
    linguistic context and posit that visual embeddings extracted from deep vision
    models (ResNet for Multi30k, ResNext for How2) do not lend themselves to increasing
    the discriminativeness between the vocabulary elements at token level prediction
    in NMT. We demonstrate this qualitatively by analyzing attention distribution
    and quantitatively through Principal Component Analysis, arriving at the conclusion
    that it is the quality of the visual embeddings rather than the length of sentences,
    which need to be improved in existing MMT datasets.

  abstract: We present a dataset consisting of what we call image description sequences,
    which are multi-sentence descriptions of the contents of an image. These descriptions
    were collected in a pseudo-interactive setting, where the describer was told to
    describe the given image to a listener who needs to identify the image within
    a set of images, and who successively asks for more information. As we show, this
    setup produced nicely structured data that, we think, will be useful for learning
    models capable of planning and realising such description discourses.

  abstract: Automatic natural language generation systems need to use the contextually-appropriate
    verbs when describing different kinds of facts or events, which has triggered
    research interest on verb selection for data-to-text generation. In this paper,
    we discuss a few limitations of the current task settings and the evaluation metrics.
    We also provide two simple, efficient, interpretable baseline approaches for statistical
    selection of trend verbs, which give a strong performance on both previously used
    evaluation metrics and our new evaluation.

  abstract: The uptake of deep learning in natural language generation (NLG) led to
    the release of both small and relatively large parallel corpora for training neural
    models. The existing data-to-text datasets are, however, aimed at task-oriented
    dialogue systems, and often thus limited in diversity and versatility. They are
    typically crowdsourced, with much of the noise left in them. Moreover, current
    neural NLG models do not take full advantage of large training data, and due to
    their strong generalizing properties produce sentences that look template-like
    regardless. We therefore present a new corpus of 7K samples, which (1) is clean
    despite being crowdsourced, (2) has utterances of 9 generalizable and conversational
    dialogue act types, making it more suitable for open-domain dialogue systems,
    and (3) explores the domain of video games, which is new to dialogue systems despite
    having excellent potential for supporting rich conversations.

  abstract: In this study, we investigate the employment of the pre-trained BERT language
    model to tackle question generation tasks. We introduce two neural architectures
    built on top of BERT for question generation tasks. The first one is a straightforward
    BERT employment, which reveals the defects of directly using BERT for text generation.
    And, the second one remedies the first one by restructuring the BERT employment
    into a sequential manner for taking information from previous decoded results.
    Our models are trained and evaluated on the question-answering dataset SQuAD.
    Experiment results show that our best model yields state-of-the-art performance
    which advances the BLEU4 score of existing best models from 16.85 to 18.91.

  abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
    relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. In this paper, we focus on the
    generation of hypotheses from premises in a multimodal setting, to generate a
    sentence (hypothesis) given an image and/or its description (premise) as the input.
    The main goals of this paper are (a) to investigate whether it is reasonable to
    frame NLI as a generation task; and (b) to consider the degree to which grounding
    textual premises in visual information is beneficial to generation. We compare
    different neural architectures, showing through automatic and human evaluation
    that entailments can indeed be generated successfully. We also show that multimodal
    models outperform unimodal models in this task, albeit marginally

    \ accuracy. We also achieve similar results not only with F-score but also with\
    \ similar experiments related to Japanese. Moreover, we prove that our detector\

    encourages the generation of label-conditioned sentences. We compared the proposed
    method with some existing methods for generating conditional responses. The experimental
    results show that our proposed method has higher controllability for dialogue
    acts even though it has higher or comparable naturalness to existing methods.

  abstract: Despite the success of style transfer in image processing, it has seen
    limited progress in natural language generation. Part of the problem is that content
    is not as easily decoupled from style in the text domain. Curiously, in the field
    of stylometry, content does not figure prominently in practical methods of discriminating
    stylistic elements, such as authorship and genre. Rather, syntax and function
    words are the most salient features. Drawing on this work, we model style as a
    suite of low-level linguistic controls, such as frequency of pronouns, prepositions,
    and subordinate clause constructions. We train a neural encoder-decoder model
    to reconstruct reference sentences given only content words and the setting of
    the controls. We perform style transfer by keeping the content words fixed while
    adjusting the controls to be indicative of another style. In experiments, we show
    that the model reliably responds to the linguistic controls and perform both automatic
    and manual evaluations on style transfer. We find we can fool a style classifier
    84% of the time, and that our model produces highly diverse and stylistically
    distinctive outputs. This work introduces a formal, extendable model of style
    that can add control to any neural text generation system.

  abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models tend to achieve the best performances
    when larger sets of parallel sentences are provided for training. For this reason,
    augmenting the training set with artificially-generated sentence pair can boost
    the performance. Nonetheless, the performance can also be improved with a small
    number of sentences if they are in the same domain as the test set. Accordingly,
    we want to explore the use of artificially-generated sentence along with data-selection
    algorithms to improve NMT models trained solely with authentic data. In this work,
    we show how artificially-generated sentences can be more beneficial than authentic
    pairs and what are their advantages when used in combination with data-selection
    algorithms.

  abstract: 'Using data-driven models for solving text summarization or similar tasks
    has become very common in the last years. Yet most of the studies report basic
    accuracy scores only, and nothing is known about the ability of the proposed models
    to improve when trained on more data. In this paper, we define and propose three
    data efficiency metrics: data score efficiency, data time deficiency and overall
    data efficiency. We also propose a simple scheme that uses those metrics and apply
    it for a more comprehensive evaluation of popular methods on text summarization
    and title generation tasks. For the latter task, we process and release a huge
    collection of 35 million abstract-title pairs from scientific articles. Our results
    reveal that among the tested models, the Transformer is the most efficient on
    both tasks.'

  abstract: We present Margin Call, a web-based text viewer that automatically generates
    short summaries for each paragraph of the text and displays the summaries in the
    margin of the text next to the corresponding paragraph. On the back-end, the summarizer
    first identifies the most important sentence for each paragraph in the text file
    uploaded by the user. The selected sentence is then automatically compressed to
    produce the short summary. The resulting summary is a few words long. The displayed
    summaries can help the user understand and retrieve information faster from the
    text, while increasing the retention of information.

  abstract: Biased decisions made by automatic systems have led to growing concerns
    in research communities. Recent work from the NLP community focuses on building
    systems that make fair decisions based on text. Instead of relying on unknown
    decision systems or human decision-makers, we argue that a better way to protect
    data providers is to remove the trails of sensitive information before publishing
    the data. In light of this, we propose a new privacy-aware text rewriting task
    and explore two privacy-aware back-translation methods for the task, based on
    adversarial training and approximate fairness risk. Our extensive experiments
    on three real-world datasets with varying demographical attributes show that our
    methods are effective in obfuscating sensitive attributes. We have also observed
    that the fairness risk method retains better semantics and fluency, while the
    adversarial training method tends to leak less sensitive information.

  abstract: End-to-end neural approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance
    in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, they often lack transparency
    of the underlying decision-making process, hindering error analysis and certain
    model improvements. In this work, we revisit the binary linearization approach
    to surface realization, which exhibits more interpretable behavior, but was falling
    short in terms of prediction accuracy. We show how enriching the training data
    to better capture word order constraints almost doubles the performance of the
    system. We further demonstrate that encoding both local and global prediction
    contexts yields another considerable performance boost. With the proposed modifications,
    the system which ranked low in the latest shared task on multilingual surface
    realization now achieves best results in five out of ten languages, while being
    on par with the state-of-the-art approaches in others.

  abstract: 'We present a dependency tree linearization model with two novel components:
    (1) a tree-structured encoder based on bidirectional Tree-LSTM that propagates
    information first bottom-up then top-down, which allows each token to access information
    from the entire tree; and (2) a linguistically motivated head-first decoder that
    emphasizes the central role of the head and linearizes the subtree by incrementally
    attaching the dependents on both sides of the head. With the new encoder and decoder,
    we reach state-of-the-art performance on the Surface Realization Shared Task 2018
    dataset, outperforming not only the shared tasks participants, but also previous
    state-of-the-art systems (Bohnet et al., 2011; Puduppully et al., 2016). Furthermore,
    we analyze the power of the tree-structured encoder with a probing task and show
    that it is able to recognize the topological relation between any pair of tokens
    in a tree.'

  abstract: We present a creative poem generator for the morphologically rich Finnish
    language. Our method falls into the master-apprentice paradigm, where a computationally
    creative genetic algorithm teaches a BRNN model to generate poetry. We model several
    parts of poetic aesthetics in the fitness function of the genetic algorithm, such
    as sonic features, semantic coherence, imagery and metaphor. Furthermore, we justify
    the creativity of our method based on the FACE theory on computational creativity
    and take additional care in evaluating our system by automatic metrics for concepts
    together with human evaluation for aesthetics, framing and expressions.

    \ proposed approach enables end-to-end training, targeting formal properties of\
    \ text such as rhythm and rhyme, which are central characteristics of rap texts.\
    \ Additionally, we explore how generating text at different scales (e.g. character-level\
    \ or word-level) affects the quality of the output. We find that a hybrid form\u2014\
    a hierarchical model that aims to integrate Language Modeling at both word and\

  abstract: Data-to-text generation models face challenges in ensuring data fidelity
    by referring to the correct input source. To inspire studies in this area, Wiseman
    et al. (2017) introduced the RotoWire corpus on generating NBA game summaries
    from the box- and line-score tables. However, limited attempts have been made
    in this direction and the challenges remain. We observe a prominent bottleneck
    in the corpus where only about 60% of the summary contents can be grounded to
    the boxscore records. Such information deficiency tends to misguide a conditioned
    language model to produce unconditioned random facts and thus leads to factual
    hallucinations. In this work, we restore the information balance and revamp this
    task to focus on fact-grounded data-to-text generation. We introduce a purified
    and larger-scale dataset, RotoWire-FG (Fact-Grounding), with 50% more data from
    the year 2017-19 and enriched input tables, and hope to attract research focuses
    in this direction. Moreover, we achieve improved data fidelity over the state-of-the-art
    models by integrating a new form of table reconstruction as an auxiliary task
    to boost the generation quality.

  abstract: "We propose a data-to-document generator that can easily control the contents\
    \ of output texts based on a neural language model. Conventional data-to-text\
    \ model is useful when a reader seeks a global summary of data because it has\
    \ only to describe an important part that has been extracted beforehand. However,\
    \ because depending on users, it differs what they are interested in, so it is\
    \ necessary to develop a method to generate various summaries according to users\u2019\
    \ interests. We develop a model to generate various summaries and to control their\
    \ contents by providing the explicit targets for a reference to the model as controllable\
    \ factors. In the experiments, we used five-minute or one-hour charts of 9 indicators\
    \ (e.g., Nikkei225), as time-series data, and daily summaries of Nikkei Quick\
    \ News as textual data. We conducted comparative experiments using two pieces\
    \ of information: human-designed topic labels indicating the contents of a sentence\
    \ and automatically extracted keywords as the referential information for generation."

  abstract: Browsing news articles on multiple devices is now possible. The lengths
    of news article headlines have precise upper bounds, dictated by the size of the
    display of the relevant device or interface. Therefore, controlling the length
    of headlines is essential when applying the task of headline generation to news
    production. However, because there is no corpus of headlines of multiple lengths
    for a given article, previous research on controlling output length in headline
    generation has not discussed whether the system outputs could be adequately evaluated
    without multiple references of different lengths. In this paper, we introduce
    two corpora, which are Japanese News Corpus (JNC) and JApanese MUlti-Length Headline
    Corpus (JAMUL), to confirm the validity of previous evaluation settings. The JNC
    provides common supervision data for headline generation. The JAMUL is a large-scale
    evaluation dataset for headlines of three different lengths composed by professional
    editors. We report new findings on these corpora; for example, although the longest
    length reference summary can appropriately evaluate the existing methods controlling
    output length, this evaluation setting has several problems.

  abstract: "Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) is used as a means of assessing the quality\
    \ of NLG evaluation data, in particular, its reliability. According to existing\
    \ scales of IAA interpretation \u2013 see, for example, Lommel et al. (2014),\
    \ Liu et al. (2016), Sedoc et al. (2018) and Amidei et al. (2018a) \u2013 most\
    \ data collected for NLG evaluation fail the reliability test. We confirmed this\
    \ trend by analysing papers published over the last 10 years in NLG-specific conferences\
    \ (in total 135 papers that included some sort of human evaluation study). Following\
    \ Sampson and Babarczy (2008), Lommel et al. (2014), Joshi et al. (2016) and Amidei\
    \ et al. (2018b), such phenomena can be explained in terms of irreducible human\
    \ language variability. Using three case studies, we show the limits of considering\
    \ IAA as the only criterion for checking evaluation reliability. Given human language\
    \ variability, we propose that for human evaluation of NLG, correlation coefficients\
    \ and agreement coefficients should be used together to obtain a better assessment\
    \ of the evaluation data reliability. This is illustrated using the three case\
    \ studies."

  abstract: Currently, there is little agreement as to how Natural Language Generation
    (NLG) systems should be evaluated. While there is some agreement regarding automatic
    metrics, there is a high degree of variation in the way that human evaluation
    is carried out. This paper provides an overview of how human evaluation is currently
    conducted, and presents a set of best practices, grounded in the literature. With
    this paper, we hope to contribute to the quality and consistency of human evaluations
    in NLG.

  abstract: 'We present a recurrent neural network based system for automatic quality
    estimation of natural language generation (NLG) outputs, which jointly learns
    to assign numerical ratings to individual outputs and to provide pairwise rankings
    of two different outputs. The latter is trained using pairwise hinge loss over
    scores from two copies of the rating network. We use learning to rank and synthetic
    data to improve the quality of ratings assigned by our system: We synthesise training
    pairs of distorted system outputs and train the system to rank the less distorted
    one higher. This leads to a 12% increase in correlation with human ratings over
    the previous benchmark. We also establish the state of the art on the dataset
    of relative rankings from the E2E NLG Challenge (Dusek et al., 2019), where synthetic
    data lead to a 4% accuracy increase over the base model.'

  abstract: Creativity is an essential element of human nature used for many activities,
    such as telling a story. Based on human creativity, researchers have attempted
    to teach a computer to generate stories automatically or support this creative
    process. In this study, we undertake the task of story ending generation. This
    is a relatively new task, in which the last sentence of a given incomplete story
    is automatically generated. This is challenging because, in order to predict an
    appropriate ending, the generation method should comprehend the context of events.
    Despite the importance of this task, no clear evaluation metric has been established
    thus far; hence, it has remained an open problem. Therefore, we study the various
    elements involved in evaluating an automatic method for generating story endings.
    First, we introduce a baseline hierarchical sequence-to-sequence method for story
    ending generation. Then, we conduct a pairwise comparison against human-written
    endings, in which annotators choose the preferable ending. In addition to a quantitative
    evaluation, we conduct a qualitative evaluation by asking annotators to specify
    the reason for their choice. From the collected reasons, we discuss what elements
    the evaluation should focus on, to thereby propose effective metrics for the task.

  abstract: This paper describes the implementation of the Hotel Scribe system. A
    commercial Natural Language Generation (NLG) system which generates descriptions
    of hotels from accommodation metadata with a high level of content and linguistic
    variation in English. It has been deployed live by *Anonymised Company Name* for
    the purpose of improving coverage of accommodation descriptions and for Search
    Engine Optimisation (SEO). In this paper, we describe the motivation for building
    this system, the challenges faced when dealing with limited metadata, and the
    implementation used to generate the highly variate accommodation descriptions.
    Additionally, we evaluate the uniqueness of the texts generated by our system
    against comparable human written accommodation description texts.

  abstract: Rating and Likert scales are widely used in evaluation experiments to
    measure the quality of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. We review the
    use of rating and Likert scales for NLG evaluation tasks published in NLG specialized
    conferences over the last ten years (135 papers in total). Our analysis brings
    to light a number of deviations from good practice in their use. We conclude with
    some recommendations about the use of such scales. Our aim is to encourage the
    appropriate use of evaluation methodologies in the NLG community.

  abstract: Task effects in NLG corpus elicitation recently started to receive more
    attention, but are usually not modeled statistically. We present a controlled
    replication of the study by Van Miltenburg et al. (2018b), contrasting spoken
    with written descriptions. We collected additional written Dutch descriptions
    to supplement the spoken data from the DIDEC corpus, and analyzed the descriptions
    using mixed effects modeling to account for variation between participants and
    items. Our results show that the effects of modality largely disappear in a controlled
    setting.

  abstract: Multimedia procedural texts, such as instructions and manuals with pictures,
    support people to share how-to knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method for
    generating a procedural text given a photo sequence allowing users to obtain a
    multimedia procedural text. We propose a single embedding space both for image
    and text enabling to interconnect them and to select appropriate words to describe
    a photo. We implemented our method and tested it on cooking instructions, i.e.,
    recipes. Various experimental results showed that our method outperforms standard
    baselines.

  abstract: SimpleNLG is a popular open source surface realiser for the English language.
    For German, however, the availability of open source and non-domain specific realisers
    is sparse, partly due to the complexity of the German language. In this paper,
    we present SimpleNLG-DE, an adaption of SimpleNLG to German. We discuss which
    parts of the German language have been implemented and how we evaluated our implementation
    using the TIGER Corpus and newly created data-sets.

  abstract: Neural natural language generation (NNLG) systems are known for their
    pathological outputs, i.e. generating text which is unrelated to the input specification.
    In this paper, we show the impact of semantic noise on state-of-the-art NNLG models
    which implement different semantic control mechanisms. We find that cleaned data
    can improve semantic correctness by up to 97%, while maintaining fluency. We also
    find that the most common error is omitting information, rather than hallucination.

  abstract: Learned dynamic weighting of the conditioning signal (attention) has been
    shown to improve neural language generation in a variety of settings. The weights
    applied when generating a particular output sequence have also been viewed as
    providing a potentially explanatory insight in the internal workings of the generator.
    In this paper, we reverse the direction of this connection and ask whether through
    the control of the attention of the model we can control its output. Specifically,
    we take a standard neural image captioning model that uses attention, and fix
    the attention to predetermined areas in the image. We evaluate whether the resulting
    output is more likely to mention the class of the object in that area than the
    normally generated caption. We introduce three effective methods to control the
    attention and find that these are producing expected results in up to 27.43% of
    the cases.

  abstract: "We present \u201CAutoJudge\u201D, an automated evaluation method for\
    \ conversational dialogue systems. The method works by first generating dialogues\
    \ based on self-talk, i.e. dialogue systems talking to itself. Then, it uses human\
    \ ratings on these dialogues to train an automated judgement model. Our experiments\
    \ show that AutoJudge correlates well with the human ratings and can be used to\
    \ automatically evaluate dialogue systems, even in deployed systems. In a second\
    \ part, we attempt to apply AutoJudge to improve existing systems. This works\
    \ well for re-ranking a set of candidate utterances. However, our experiments\
    \ show that AutoJudge cannot be applied as reward for reinforcement learning,\
    \ although the metric can distinguish good from bad dialogues. We discuss potential\
    \ reasons, but state here already that this is still an open question for further\
    \ research."

  abstract: In this work, we examine whether it is possible to achieve the state of
    the art performance in paraphrase generation with reduced vocabulary. Our approach
    consists of building a convolution to sequence model (Conv2Seq) partially guided
    by the reinforcement learning, and training it on the subword representation of
    the input. The experiment on the Quora dataset, which contains over 140,000 pairs
    of sentences and corresponding paraphrases, found that with less than 1,000 token
    types, we were able to achieve performance which exceeded that of the current
    state of the art.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a novel data-to-text system for cancer patients,
    providing information on quality of life implications after treatment, which can
    be embedded in the context of shared decision making. Currently, information on
    quality of life implications is often not discussed, partly because (until recently)
    data has been lacking. In our work, we rely on a newly developed prediction model,
    which assigns patients to scenarios. Furthermore, we use data-to-text techniques
    to explain these scenario-based predictions in personalized and understandable
    language. We highlight the possibilities of NLG for personalization, discuss ethical
    implications and also present the outcomes of a first evaluation with clinicians.

  abstract: Current approaches to Natural Language Generation (NLG) for dialog mainly
    focus on domain-specific, task-oriented applications (e.g. restaurant booking)
    using limited ontologies (up to 20 slot types), usually without considering the
    previous conversation context. Furthermore, these approaches require large amounts
    of data for each domain, and do not benefit from examples that may be available
    for other domains. This work explores the feasibility of applying statistical
    NLG to scenarios requiring larger ontologies, such as multi-domain dialog applications
    or open-domain question answering (QA) based on knowledge graphs. We model NLG
    through an Encoder-Decoder framework using a large dataset of interactions between
    real-world users and a conversational agent for open-domain QA. First, we investigate
    the impact of increasing the number of slot types on the generation quality and
    experiment with different partitions of the QA data with progressively larger
    ontologies (up to 369 slot types). Second, we perform multi-task learning experiments
    between open-domain QA and task-oriented dialog, and benchmark our model on a
    popular NLG dataset. Moreover, we experiment with using the conversational context
    as an additional input to improve response generation quality. Our experiments
    show the feasibility of learning statistical NLG models for open-domain QA with
    larger ontologies.

  abstract: 'People with sight impairments can access to a mathematical expression
    by using its LaTeX source. However, this mechanisms have several drawbacks: (1)
    it assumes the knowledge of the LaTeX, (2) it is slow, since LaTeX is verbose
    and (3) it is error-prone since LATEX is a typographical language. In this paper
    we study the design of a natural language generation system for producing a mathematical
    sentence, i.e. a natural language sentence expressing the semantics of a mathematical
    expression. Moreover, we describe the main results of a first human based evaluation
    experiment of the system for Italian language.'

  abstract: "Statistical generators increasingly dominate the research in NLG. However,\
    \ grammar-based generators that are grounded in a solid linguistic framework remain\
    \ very competitive, especially for generation from deep knowledge structures.\
    \ Furthermore, if built modularly, they can be ported to other genres and languages\
    \ with a limited amount of work, without the need of the annotation of a considerable\
    \ amount of training data. One of these generators is FORGe, which is based on\
    \ the Meaning-Text Model. In the recent WebNLG challenge (the first comprehensive\
    \ task addressing the mapping of RDF triples to text) FORGe ranked first with\
    \ respect to the overall quality in human evaluation. We extend the coverage of\
    \ FORGE\u2019s open source grammatical and lexical resources for English, so as\
    \ to further improve the English texts, and port them to Spanish, to achieve a\
    \ comparable quality. This confirms that, as already observed in the case of SimpleNLG,\
    \ a robust universal grammar-driven framework and a systematic organization of\
    \ the linguistic resources can be an adequate choice for NLG applications."

  abstract: "We present an approach to generating natural language justifications\
    \ of decisions derived from norm-based reasoning. Assuming an agent which maximally\
    \ satisfies a set of rules specified in an object-oriented temporal logic, the\
    \ user can ask factual questions (about the agent\u2019s rules, actions, and the\

  abstract: A math word problem is a narrative with a specific topic that provides
    clues to the correct equation with numerical quantities and variables therein.
    In this paper, we focus on the task of generating math word problems. Previous
    works are mainly template-based with pre-defined rules. We propose a novel neural
    network model to generate math word problems from the given equations and topics.
    First, we design a fusion mechanism to incorporate the information of both equations
    and topics. Second, an entity-enforced loss is introduced to ensure the relevance
    between the generated math problem and the equation. Automatic evaluation results
    show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline models. In
    human evaluations, the math word problems generated by our model are rated as
    being more relevant (in terms of solvability of the given equations and relevance
    to topics) and natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) than the baseline models.

  abstract: We introduce DisSim, a discourse-aware sentence splitting framework for
    English and German whose goal is to transform syntactically complex sentences
    into an intermediate representation that presents a simple and more regular structure
    which is easier to process for downstream semantic applications. For this purpose,
    we turn input sentences into a two-layered semantic hierarchy in the form of core
    facts and accompanying contexts, while identifying the rhetorical relations that
    hold between them. In that way, we preserve the coherence structure of the input
    and, hence, its interpretability for downstream tasks.

  abstract: This paper describes our submission to the TL;DR challenge. Neural abstractive
    summarization models have been successful in generating fluent and consistent
    summaries with advancements like the copy (Pointer-generator) and coverage mechanisms.
    However, these models suffer from their extractive nature as they learn to copy
    words from the source text. In this paper, we propose a novel abstractive model
    based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to address this issue. We also propose
    a Unified Summarization Framework for the generation of summaries. Our model eliminates
    non-critical information at a sentence-level with an extractive summarization
    module and generates the summary word by word using an abstractive summarization
    module. To implement our framework, we combine submodules with state-of-the-art
    techniques including Pointer-Generator Network (PGN) and BERT while also using
    our new VAE-PGN abstractive model. We evaluate our model on the benchmark Reddit
    corpus as part of the TL;DR challenge and show that our model outperforms the
    baseline in ROUGE score while generating diverse summaries.

  abstract: Neural abstractive document summarization is commonly approached by models
    that exhibit a mostly extractive behavior. This behavior is facilitated by a copy-attention
    which allows models to copy words from a source document. While models in the
    mostly extractive news summarization domain benefit from this inductive bias,
    they commonly fail to paraphrase or compress information from the source document.
    Recent advances in transfer-learning from large pretrained language models give
    rise to alternative approaches that do not rely on copy-attention and instead
    learn to generate concise and abstractive summaries. In this paper, as part of
    the TL;DR challenge, we compare the abstractiveness of summaries from different
    summarization approaches and show that transfer-learning can be efficiently utilized
    without any changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate that the approach
    leads to a higher level of abstraction for a similar performance on the TL;DR
    challenge tasks, enabling true natural language compression.

  abstract: Quantified expressions have always taken up a central position in formal
    theories of meaning and language use. Yet quantified expressions have so far attracted
    far less attention from the Natural Language Generation community than, for example,
    referring expressions. In an attempt to start redressing the balance, we investigate
    a recently developed corpus in which quantified expressions play a crucial role;
    the corpus is the result of a carefully controlled elicitation experiment, in
    which human participants were asked to describe visually presented scenes. Informed
    by an analysis of this corpus, we propose algorithms that produce computer-generated
    descriptions of a wider class of visual scenes, and we evaluate the descriptions
    generated by these algorithms in terms of their correctness, completeness, and
    human-likeness. We discuss what this exercise can teach us about the nature of
    quantification and about the challenges posed by the generation of quantified
    expressions.

  abstract: 'Generating grounded image descriptions requires associating linguistic
    units with their corresponding visual clues. A common method is to train a decoder
    language model with attention mechanism over convolutional visual features. Attention
    weights align the stratified visual features arranged by their location with tokens,
    most commonly words, in the target description. However, words such as spatial
    relations (e.g. next to and under) are not directly referring to geometric arrangements
    of pixels but to complex geometric and conceptual representations. The aim of
    this paper is to evaluate what representations facilitate generating image descriptions
    with spatial relations and lead to better grounded language generation. In particular,
    we investigate the contribution of three different representational modalities
    in generating relational referring expressions: (i) pre-trained convolutional
    visual features, (ii) different top-down geometric relational knowledge between
    objects, and (iii) world knowledge captured by contextual embeddings in language
    models.'

  abstract: In Natural Language Generation (NLG), End-to-End (E2E) systems trained
    through deep learning have recently gained a strong interest. Such deep models
    need a large amount of carefully annotated data to reach satisfactory performance.
    However, acquiring such datasets for every new NLG application is a tedious and
    time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning
    scheme that can learn from non-annotated data and annotated data when available.
    It uses a NLG and a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) sequence-to-sequence
    models which are learned jointly to compensate for the lack of annotation. Experiments
    on two benchmark datasets show that, with limited amount of annotated data, the
    method can achieve very competitive results while not using any pre-processing
    or re-scoring tricks. These findings open the way to the exploitation of non-annotated
    datasets which is the current bottleneck for the E2E NLG system development to
    new applications.

  abstract: 'We present the first dataset targeted at end-to-end NLG in Czech in the
    restaurant domain, along with several strong baseline models using the sequence-to-sequence
    approach. While non-English NLG is under-explored in general, Czech, as a morphologically
    rich language, makes the task even harder: Since Czech requires inflecting named
    entities, delexicalization or copy mechanisms do not work out-of-the-box and lexicalizing
    the generated outputs is non-trivial. In our experiments, we present two different
    approaches to this this problem: (1) using a neural language model to select the
    correct inflected form while lexicalizing, (2) a two-step generation setup: our
    sequence-to-sequence model generates an interleaved sequence of lemmas and morphological
    tags, which are then inflected by a morphological generator.'

  abstract: "Recently, significant improvements have been achieved in various natural\
    \ language processing tasks using neural sequence-to-sequence models. While aiming\
    \ for the best generation quality is important, ultimately it is also necessary\
    \ to develop models that can assess the quality of their output. In this work,\
    \ we propose to use the similarity between training and test conditions as a measure\
    \ for models\u2019 confidence. We investigate methods solely using the similarity\
    \ as well as methods combining it with the posterior probability. While traditionally\
    \ only target tokens are annotated with confidence measures, we also investigate\
    \ methods to annotate source tokens with confidence. By learning an internal alignment\
    \ model, we can significantly improve confidence projection over using state-of-the-art\
    \ external alignment tools. We evaluate the proposed methods on downstream confidence\
    \ estimation for machine translation (MT). We show improvements on segment-level\
    \ confidence estimation as well as on confidence estimation for source tokens.\
    \ In addition, we show that the same methods can also be applied to other tasks\
    \ using sequence-to-sequence models. On the automatic speech recognition (ASR)\
    \ task, we are able to find 60% of the errors by looking at 20% of the data."

  abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are quickly becoming the de facto standard
    modeling method for many natural language generation (NLG) tasks. In order for
    such models to truly be useful, they must be capable of correctly generating utterances
    for novel meaning representations (MRs) at test time. In practice, even sophisticated
    DNNs with various forms of semantic control frequently fail to generate utterances
    faithful to the input MR. In this paper, we propose an architecture agnostic self-training
    method to sample novel MR/text utterance pairs to augment the original training
    data. Remarkably, after training on the augmented data, even simple encoder-decoder
    models with greedy decoding are capable of generating semantically correct utterances
    that are as good as state-of-the-art outputs in both automatic and human evaluations
    of quality.

  abstract: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful method for learning representations
    of high-dimensional data. However, VAEs can suffer from an issue known as latent
    variable collapse (or KL term vanishing), where the posterior collapses to the
    prior and the model will ignore the latent codes in generative tasks. Such an
    issue is particularly prevalent when employing VAE-RNN architectures for text
    modelling (Bowman et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). In this paper, we present
    a new architecture called Full-Sampling-VAE-RNN, which can effectively avoid latent
    variable collapse. Compared to the general VAE-RNN architectures, we show that
    our model can achieve much more stable training process and can generate text
    with significantly better quality.

  abstract: Parallel corpora constitute a unique re-source for providing assistance
    to human translators. The selection and preparation of the parallel corpora also
    conditions the quality of the resulting MT engine. Since Croatian is a national
    language and Italian is officially recognized as a minority lan-guage in seven
    cities and twelve munici-palities of Istria County, a large amount of parallel
    texts is produced on a daily basis. However, there have been no attempts in using
    these texts for compiling a parallel corpus. A domain-specific sentence-aligned
    parallel Croatian-Italian corpus of administrative texts would be of high value
    in creating different language tools and resources. The aim of this paper is,
    therefore, to explore the value of parallel documents which are publicly available
    mostly in pdf format and to investigate the use of automatically-built dictionaries
    in corpus compilation. The effects that a document format and, consequently sentence
    splitting, and the dictionary input have on the sentence alignment process are
    manually evaluated.

  abstract: We propose a metric for machine translation evaluation based on frame
    semantics which does not require the use of reference translations or human corrections,
    but is aimed at comparing original and translated output directly. The metrics
    is described on the basis of an existing manual frame-semantic annotation of a
    parallel corpus with an English original and a Brazilian Portuguese and a German
    translation. We discuss implications of our metrics design, including the potential
    of scaling it for multiple languages.

  abstract: "Recent advances in artificial neural networks now have a great impact\
    \ on translation technology. A considerable achievement was reached in this field\
    \ with the publication of L\u2019Apprentissage Profond. This book, originally\
    \ written in English (Deep Learning), was entirely machine-translated into French\
    \ and post-edited by several experts. In this context, it appears essential to\
    \ have a clear vision of the performance of MT tools. Providing an evaluation\
    \ of NMT is precisely the aim of the present research paper. To accomplish this\
    \ objective, a framework for error categorisation was built and a comparative\
    \ analysis of the raw translation output and the post-edited version was performed\
    \ with the purpose of identifying recurring patterns of errors. The findings showed\
    \ that even though some grammatical errors were spotted, the output was generally\
    \ correct from a linguistic point of view. The most recurring errors are linked\
    \ to the specialised terminology employed in this book. Further errors include\
    \ parts of text that were not translated as well as edits based on stylistic preferences.\
    \ The major part of the output was not acceptable as such and required several\
    \ edits per segment, but some sentences were of publishable quality and were therefore\
    \ left untouched in the final version."

  abstract: 'We use a range of morpho-syntactic features inspired by research in register
    studies (e.g. Biber, 1995; Neumann, 2013) and translation studies (e.g. Ilisei
    et al., 2010; Zanettin, 2013; Kunilovskaya and Kutuzov, 2018) to reveal the association
    between translationese and human translation quality. Translationese is understood
    as any statistical deviations of translations from non-translations (Baker, 1993)
    and is assumed to affect the fluency of translations, rendering them foreign-sounding
    and clumsy of wording and structure. This connection is often posited or implied
    in the studies of translationese or translational varieties (De Sutter et al.,
    2017), but is rarely directly tested. Our 45 features include frequencies of selected
    morphological forms and categories, some types of syntactic structures and relations,
    as well as several overall text measures extracted from Universal Dependencies
    annotation. The research corpora include English-to-Russian professional and student
    translations of informational or argumentative newspaper texts and a comparable
    corpus of non-translated Russian. Our results indicate lack of direct association
    between translationese and quality in our data: while our features distinguish
    translations and non-translations with the near perfect accuracy, the performance
    of the same algorithm on the quality classes barely exceeds the chance level.'

  abstract: "The translation of wordplay is one of the most extensively researched\
    \ problems in translation studies, but it has attracted little attention in the\
    \ fields of natural language processing and machine translation. This is because\
    \ today\u2019s language technologies treat anomalies and ambiguities in the input\
    \ as things that must be resolved in favour of a single \u201Ccorrect\u201D interpretation,\
    \ rather than preserved and interpreted in their own right. But if computers cannot\
    \ yet process such creative language on their own, can they at least provide specialized\
    \ support to translation professionals? In this paper, I survey the state of the\
    \ art relevant to computational processing of humorous wordplay and put forth\
    \ a vision of how existing theories, resources, and technologies could be adapted\
    \ and extended to support interactive, computer-assisted translation."

  abstract: The automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) has proven to be
    a very significant research topic. Most automatic evaluation methods focus on
    the evaluation of the output of MT as they compute similarity scores that represent
    translation quality. This work targets on the performance of MT evaluation. We
    present a general scheme for learning to classify parallel translations, using
    linguistic information, of two MT model outputs and one human (reference) translation.
    We present three experiments to this scheme using neural networks (NN). One using
    string based hand-crafted features (Exp1), the second using automatically trained
    embeddings from the reference and the two MT outputs (one from a statistical machine
    translation (SMT) model and the other from a neural ma-chine translation (NMT)
    model), which are learned using NN (Exp2), and the third experiment (Exp3) that
    combines information from the other two experiments. The languages involved are
    English (EN), Greek (GR) and Italian (IT) segments are educational in domain.
    The proposed language-independent learning scheme which combines information from
    the two experiments (experiment 3) achieves higher classification accuracy compared
    with models using BLEU score information as well as other classification approaches,
    such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

  abstract: "In this study, we compare the output quality of two MT systems, a statistical\
    \ (SMT) and a neural (NMT) engine, customised for Swiss Post\u2019s Language Service\
    \ using the same training data. We focus on the point of view of professional\
    \ translators and investigate how they perceive the differences between the MT\
    \ output and a human reference (namely deletions, substitutions, insertions and\
    \ word order). Our findings show that translators more frequently consider these\
    \ differences to be errors in SMT than NMT, and that deletions are the most serious\
    \ errors in both architectures. We also observe lower agreement on differences\
    \ to be corrected in NMT than in SMT, suggesting that errors are easier to identify\
    \ in SMT. These findings confirm the ability of NMT to produce correct paraphrases,\
    \ which could also explain why BLEU is often considered as an inadequate metric\
    \ to evaluate the performance of NMT systems."

  abstract: The Chinese/English Political Interpreting Corpus (CEPIC) is a new electronic
    and open access resource developed for translators and interpreters, especially
    those working with political text types. Over 6 million word tokens in size, the
    online corpus consists of transcripts of Chinese (Cantonese & Putonghua) / English
    political speeches and their translated and interpreted texts. It includes rich
    meta-data and is POS-tagged and annotated with prosodic and paralinguistic features
    that are of concern to spoken language and interpreting. The online platform of
    the CEPIC features main functions including Keyword Search, Word Collocation and
    Expanded Keyword in Context, which are illustrated in the paper. The CEPIC can
    shed light on online translation and interpreting corpora development in the future.

  abstract: "The emergence of China as a global economic power in the 21st Century\
    \ has brought about surging needs for cross-lingual and cross-cultural mediation,\
    \ typically performed by translators. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and\
    \ Language Engineering have been bolstered by Machine learning and suitable Big\
    \ Data cultivation. They have helped to meet some of the translator\u2019s needs,\
    \ though the technical specialists have not kept pace with the practical and expanding\
    \ requirements in language mediation. One major technical and linguistic hurdle\
    \ involves words outside the vocabulary of the translator or the lexical database\
    \ he/she consults, especially Multi-Word Expressions (Compound Words) in technical\
    \ subjects. A further problem is in the multiplicity of renditions of a term in\
    \ the target language. This paper discusses a proactive approach following the\
    \ successful extraction and application of sizable bilingual Multi-Word Expressions\
    \ (Compound Words) for language mediation in technical subjects, which do not\
    \ fall within the expertise of typical translators, who have inadequate appreciation\
    \ of the range of new technical tools available to help him/her. Our approach\
    \ draws on the personal reflections of translators and teachers of translation\
    \ and is based on the prior R&D efforts relating to 300,000 comparable Chinese-English\
    \ patents. The subsequent protocol we have developed aims to be proactive in meeting\
    \ four identified practical challenges in technical translation (e.g. patents).\
    \ It has broader economic implication in the Age of Big Data (Tsou et al, 2015)\
    \ and Trade War, as the workload, if not, the challenges, increasingly cannot\
    \ be met by currently available front-line translators. We shall demonstrate how\
    \ new tools can be harnessed to spearhead the application of language technology\
    \ not only in language mediation but also in the \u201Cteaching\u201D and \u201C\
    learning\u201D of translation. It shows how a better appreciation of their needs\
    \ may enhance the contributions of the technical specialists, and thus enhance\
    \ the resultant synergetic benefits."

  abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) was shown to produce more fluent output
    than phrase-based statistical (PBMT) and rule-based machine translation (RBMT).
    However, improved fluency makes it more difficult for post editors to identify
    and correct adequacy errors, because unlike RBMT and SMT, in NMT adequacy errors
    are frequently not anticipated by fluency errors. Omissions and additions of content
    in otherwise flawlessly fluent NMT output are the most prominent types of such
    adequacy errors, which can only be detected with reference to source texts. This
    contribution explores the degree of semantic similarity between source texts,
    NMT output and post edited output. In this way, computational semantic similarity
    scores (cosine similarity) are related to human quality judgments. The analyses
    are based on publicly available NMT post editing data annotated for errors in
    three language pairs (EN-DE, EN-LV, EN-HR) with the Multidimensional Quality Metrics
    (MQM). Methodologically, this contribution tests whether cross-language aligned
    word embeddings as the sole source of semantic information mirror human error
    annotation.

  abstract: Technologies and their constant updates and innovative nature drastically
    and irreversibly transformed this small business into a leading brand on the translation
    market, along with just few other LSPs integrating translation software solutions.
    Now, we are constantly following the new developments in software updates and
    online platforms and we are successfully keeping up with any new trend in the
    field of translation, localization, transcreation, revision, post-editing, etc.
    Ultimately, we are positive that proper implementation of technology (with focus
    on quality, cost and time) and hard work are the stepping stones in the way to
    become a trusted translation services provider.

  abstract: "Technology is a big challenge and raises many questions and issues when\
    \ it comes to its application in the translation process, but translation\u2019\
    s biggest problem is not technology; it is rather how technology is perceived\
    \ by translators. MT developers and researchers should take into account this\
    \ perception and move towards a more democratized approach to include the base\
    \ of the translation industry and perhaps its more valuable asset, the translators."

  abstract: 'The objective of the 2019 RANLP Multilingual Headline Generation (HG)
    Task is to explore some of the challenges highlighted by current state of the
    art approaches on creating informative headlines to news articles: non-descriptive
    headlines, out-of-domain training data, generating headlines from long documents
    which are not well represented by the head heuristic, and dealing with multilingual
    domain. This tasks makes available a large set of training data for headline generation
    and provides an evaluation methods for the task. Our data sets are drawn from
    Wikinews as well as Wikipedia. Participants were required to generate headlines
    for at least 3 languages, which were evaluated via automatic methods. A key aspect
    of the task is multilinguality. The task measures the performance of multilingual
    headline generation systems using the Wikipedia and Wikinews articles in multiple
    languages. The objective is to assess the performance of automatic headline generation
    techniques on text documents covering a diverse range of languages and topics
    outside the news domain.'

  abstract: The Financial Narrative Summarisation task at MultiLing 2019 aims to demonstrate
    the value and challenges of applying automatic text summarisation to financial
    text written in English, usually referred to as financial narrative disclosures.
    The task dataset has been extracted from UK annual reports published in PDF file
    format. The participants were asked to provide structured summaries, based on
    real-world, publicly available financial annual reports of UK firms by extracting
    information from different key sections. Participants were asked to generate summaries
    that reflects the analysis and assessment of the financial trend of the business
    over the past year, as provided by annual reports. The evaluation of the summaries
    was performed using AutoSummENG and Rouge automatic metrics. This paper focuses
    mainly on the data creation process.

  abstract: This report covers the summarization evaluation task, proposed to the
    summarization community via the MultiLing 2019 Workshop of the RANLP 2019 conference.
    The task aims to encourage the development of automatic summarization evaluation
    methods closely aligned with manual, human-authored summary grades and judgements.
    A multilingual setting is adopted, building upon a corpus of Wikinews articles
    across 6 languages (English, Arabic, Romanian, Greek, Spanish and Czech). The
    evaluation utilizes human (golden) and machine-generated (peer) summaries, which
    have been assigned human evaluation scores from previous MultiLing tasks. Using
    these resources, the original corpus is augmented with synthetic data, combining
    summary texts under three different strategies (reorder, merge and replace), each
    engineered to introduce noise in the summary in a controlled and quantifiable
    way. We estimate that the utilization of such data can extract and highlight useful
    attributes of summary quality estimation, aiding the creation of data-driven automatic
    methods with an increased correlation to human summary evaluations across domains
    and languages. This paper provides a brief description of the summary evaluation
    task, the data generation protocol and the resources made available by the MultiLing
    community, towards improving automatic summarization evaluation.

  abstract: In this study, we examine the effect of probabilistic topic model-based
    word representations, on sentence-based extractive summarization. We formulate
    the task of summary extraction as a binary classification problem, and we test
    a variety of machine learning algorithms, exploring a range of different settings.
    An wide experimental evaluation on the MultiLing 2015 MSS dataset illustrates
    that topic-based representations can prove beneficial to the extractive summarization
    process in terms of F1, ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W scores, compared to a TF-IDF baseline,
    with QDA-based analysis providing the best results.

  abstract: Game reviews have constituted a unique means of interaction between players
    and companies for many years. The dynamics appearing through online publishing
    have significantly grown the number of comments per game, giving rise to very
    interesting communities. The growth has, in turn, led to a difficulty in dealing
    with the volume and varying quality of the comments as a source of information.
    This work studies whether and how game reviews can be summarized, based on the
    notions pre-existing in aspect-based summarization and sentiment analysis. The
    work provides suggested pipeline of analysis, also offering preliminary findings
    on whether aspects detected in a set of comments can be consistently evaluated
    by human users.

  abstract: Automatic text summarization aims at producing a shorter version of a
    document (or a document set). Evaluation of summarization quality is a challenging
    task. Because human evaluations are expensive and evaluators often disagree between
    themselves, many researchers prefer to evaluate their systems automatically, with
    help of software tools. Such a tool usually requires a point of reference in the
    form of one or more human-written summaries for each text in the corpus. Then,
    a system-generated summary is compared to one or more human-written summaries,
    according to selected metrics. However, a single metric cannot reflect all quality-related
    aspects of a summary. In this paper we present the EvAluation SYstem for Multilingual
    Summarization (EASY-M), which enables the evaluation of system-generated summaries
    in 17 different languages with several quality measures, based on comparison with
    their human-generated counterparts. The system also provides comparative results
    with two built-in baselines. The source code and both online and offline versions
    of EASY-M is freely available for the NLP community.

  abstract: In this study we examine the effect of semantic augmentation approaches
    on extractive text summarization. Wordnet hypernym relations are used to extract
    term-frequency concept information, subsequently concatenated to sentence-level
    representations produced by aggregated deep neural word embeddings. Multiple dimensionality
    reduction techniques and combination strategies are examined via feature transformation
    and clustering methods. An experimental evaluation on the MultiLing 2015 MSS dataset
    illustrates that semantic information can introduce benefits to the extractive
    summarization process in terms of F1, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, with LSA-based
    post-processing introducing the largest improvements.

  abstract: 'This paper is a part of a collaboration between computer scientists and
    historians aimed at development of novel tools and methods to improve analysis
    of historical newspapers. We present a case study of ideological terms ending
    with -ism suffix in nineteenth century Finnish newspapers. We propose a two-step
    procedure to trace differences in word usages over time: training of diachronic
    embeddings on several time slices and when clustering embeddings of selected words
    together with their neighbours to obtain historical context. The obtained clusters
    turn out to be useful for historical studies. The paper also discuss specific
    difficulties related to development historian-oriented tools.'

  abstract: Geotagging historic and cultural texts provides valuable access to heritage
    data, enabling location-based searching and new geographically related discoveries.
    In this paper, we describe two distinct approaches to geotagging a variety of
    fine-grained toponyms in a diachronic corpus of alpine texts. By applying a traditional
    gazetteer-based approach, aided by a few simple heuristics, we attain strong high-precision
    annotations. Using the output of this earlier system, we adopt a state-of-the-art
    neural approach in order to facilitate the detection of new toponyms on the basis
    of context. Additionally, we present the results of preliminary experiments on
    integrating a small amount of crowdsourced annotations to improve overall performance
    of toponym recognition in our heritage corpus.

  abstract: Preservation of the cultural heritage by means of digital methods became
    extremely popular during last years. After intensive digitization campaigns the
    focus moves slowly from the genuine preservation (i.e digital archiving together
    with standard search mechanisms) to research-oriented usage of materials available
    electronically. This usage is intended to go far beyond simple reading of digitized
    materials; researchers should be able to gain new insigts in materials, discover
    new facts by means of tools relying on innovative algorithms. In this article
    we will describe the workflow necessary for the annotation of a dichronic corpus
    of classical Ethiopic, language of essential importance for the study of Early
    Christianity

  abstract: The paper shows how a multilingual hierarchical thesaurus, or taxonomy,
    can be created and implemented in compliance with Semantic Web requirements by
    means of the data model SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System). It takes
    the EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure) portal as an example, and
    shows how open-source software like SKOS Play! can facilitate the task.

  abstract: 'The paper presents an ongoing project of the NBU Laboratory for Language
    Technology aiming to create a multilingual, CEFR-graded electronic didactic resource
    for online learning, centered on the history and cultural heritage of the EU (e-EULearn).
    The resource is developed within the e-Platform of the NBU Laboratory for Language
    Technology and re-uses the rich corpus of educational material created at the
    Laboratory for the needs of NBU program modules, distance and blended learning
    language courses and other projects. Focus being not just on foreign language
    tuition, but above all on people, places and events in the history and culture
    of the EU member states, the annotation modules of the e-Platform have been accordingly
    extended. Current and upcoming activities are directed at: 1/ enriching the English
    corpus of didactic materials on EU history and culture, 2/ translating the texts
    into (the) other official EU languages and aligning the translations with the
    English texts; 3/ developing new test modules. In the process of developing this
    resource, a database on important people, places, objects and events in the cultural
    history of the EU will be created.'

  abstract: Many applications in Digital Humanities (DH) rely on annotations of the
    raw material. These annotations (inferred automatically or done manually) assume
    that labelled facts are either true or false, thus all inferences started on such
    annotations us boolean logic. This contradicts hermeneutic principles used by
    humanites in which most part of the knowledge has a degree of truth which varies
    depending on the experience and the world knowledge of the interpreter. In this
    paper we will show how uncertainty and vagueness, two main features of any historical
    text can be encoded in annotations and thus be considered by DH applications.
