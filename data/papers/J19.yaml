  abstract: 'Nominal compounds such as red wine and nut case display a continuum of
    compositionality, with varying contributions from the components of the compound
    to its semantics. This article proposes a framework for compound compositionality
    prediction using distributional semantic models, evaluating to what extent they
    capture idiomaticity compared to human judgments. For evaluation, we introduce
    data sets containing human judgments in three languages: English, French, and
    Portuguese. The results obtained reveal a high agreement between the models and
    human predictions, suggesting that they are able to incorporate information about
    idiomaticity. We also present an in-depth evaluation of various factors that can
    affect prediction, such as model and corpus parameters and compositionality operations.
    General crosslingual analyses reveal the impact of morphological variation and
    corpus size in the ability of the model to predict compositionality, and of a
    uniform combination of the components for best results.'

  abstract: This article describes a neural semantic parser that maps natural language
    utterances onto logical forms that can be executed against a task-specific environment,
    such as a knowledge base or a database, to produce a response. The parser generates
    tree-structured logical forms with a transition-based approach, combining a generic
    tree-generation algorithm with domain-general grammar defined by the logical language.
    The generation process is modeled by structured recurrent neural networks, which
    provide a rich encoding of the sentential context and generation history for making
    predictions. To tackle mismatches between natural language and logical form tokens,
    various attention mechanisms are explored. Finally, we consider different training
    settings for the neural semantic parser, including fully supervised training where
    annotated logical forms are given, weakly supervised training where denotations
    are provided, and distant supervision where only unlabeled sentences and a knowledge
    base are available. Experiments across a wide range of data sets demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our parser.

  abstract: "We report our work on building linguistic resources and data-driven parsers\
    \ in the grammatical relation (GR) analysis for Mandarin Chinese. Chinese, as\
    \ an analytic language, encodes grammatical information in a highly configurational\
    \ rather than morphological way. Accordingly, it is possible and reasonable to\
    \ represent almost all grammatical relations as bilexical dependencies. In this\
    \ work, we propose to represent grammatical information using general directed\
    \ dependency graphs. Both only-local and rich long-distance dependencies are explicitly\
    \ represented. To create high-quality annotations, we take advantage of an existing\
    \ TreeBank, namely, Chinese TreeBank (CTB), which is grounded on the Government\
    \ and Binding theory. We define a set of linguistic rules to explore CTB\u2019\
    s implicit phrase structural information and build deep dependency graphs. The\
    \ reliability of this linguistically motivated GR extraction procedure is highlighted\
    \ by manual evaluation. Based on the converted corpus, data-driven, including\
    \ graph- and transition-based, models are explored for Chinese GR parsing. For\
    \ graph-based parsing, a new perspective, graph merging, is proposed for building\
    \ flexible dependency graphs: constructing complex graphs via constructing simple\
    \ subgraphs. Two key problems are discussed in this perspective: (1) how to decompose\
    \ a complex graph into simple subgraphs, and (2) how to combine subgraphs into\
    \ a coherent complex graph. For transition-based parsing, we introduce a neural\
    \ parser based on a list-based transition system. We also discuss several other\
    \ key problems, including dynamic oracle and beam search for neural transition-based\
    \ parsing. Evaluation gauges how successful GR parsing for Chinese can be by applying\
    \ data-driven models. The empirical analysis suggests several directions for future\
    \ study."

  abstract: Sound correspondence patterns play a crucial role for linguistic reconstruction.
    Linguists use them to prove language relationship, to reconstruct proto-forms,
    and for classical phylogenetic reconstruction based on shared innovations. Cognate
    words that fail to conform with expected patterns can further point to various
    kinds of exceptions in sound change, such as analogy or assimilation of frequent
    words. Here I present an automatic method for the inference of sound correspondence
    patterns across multiple languages based on a network approach. The core idea
    is to represent all columns in aligned cognate sets as nodes in a network with
    edges representing the degree of compatibility between the nodes. The task of
    inferring all compatible correspondence sets can then be handled as the well-known
    minimum clique cover problem in graph theory, which essentially seeks to split
    the graph into the smallest number of cliques in which each node is represented
    by exactly one clique. The resulting partitions represent all correspondence patterns
    that can be inferred for a given data set. By excluding those patterns that occur
    in only a few cognate sets, the core of regularly recurring sound correspondences
    can be inferred. Based on this idea, the article presents a method for automatic
    correspondence pattern recognition, which is implemented as part of a Python library
    which supplements the article. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, I present
    how the inferred patterns can be used to predict words that have not been observed
    before.

  abstract: We study the problem of response selection for multi-turn conversation
    in retrieval-based chatbots. The task involves matching a response candidate with
    a conversation context, the challenges for which include how to recognize important
    parts of the context, and how to model the relationships among utterances in the
    context. Existing matching methods may lose important information in contexts
    as we can interpret them with a unified framework in which contexts are transformed
    to fixed-length vectors without any interaction with responses before matching.
    This motivates us to propose a new matching framework that can sufficiently carry
    important information in contexts to matching and model relationships among utterances
    at the same time. The new framework, which we call a sequential matching framework
    (SMF), lets each utterance in a context interact with a response candidate at
    the first step and transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors
    are then accumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with
    a recurrent neural network (RNN) that models relationships among utterances. Context-response
    matching is then calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. Under SMF, we propose
    a sequential convolutional network and sequential attention network and conduct
    experiments on two public data sets to test their performance. Experiment results
    show that both models can significantly outperform state-of-the-art matching methods.
    We also show that the models are interpretable with visualizations that provide
    us insights on how they capture and leverage important information in contexts
    for matching.
