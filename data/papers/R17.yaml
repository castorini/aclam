  abstract: Word sense disambiguation is defined as finding the corresponding sense
    for a target word in a given context, which comprises a major step in text applications.
    Recently, it has been addressed as an optimization problem. The idea behind is
    to find a sequence of senses that corresponds to the words in a given context
    with a maximum semantic similarity. Metaheuristics like simulated annealing and
    D-Bees provide approximate good-enough solutions, but are usually influenced by
    the starting parameters. In this paper, we study the parameter tuning for both
    algorithms within the word sense disambiguation problem. The experiments are conducted
    on different datasets to cover different disambiguation scenarios. We show that
    D-Bees is robust and less sensitive towards the initial parameters compared to
    simulated annealing, hence, it is sufficient to tune the parameters once and reuse
    them for different datasets, domains or languages.

  abstract: In the current context of scientific information overload, text mining
    tools are of paramount importance for researchers who have to read scientific
    papers and assess their value. Current citation networks, which link papers by
    citation relationships (reference and citing paper), are useful to quantitatively
    understand the value of a piece of scientific work, however they are limited in
    that they do not provide information about what specific part of the reference
    paper the citing paper is referring to. This qualitative information is very important,
    for example, in the context of current community-based scientific summarization
    activities. In this paper, and relying on an annotated dataset of co-citation
    sentences, we carry out a number of experiments aimed at, given a citation sentence,
    automatically identify a part of a reference paper being cited. Additionally our
    algorithm predicts the specific reason why such reference sentence has been cited
    out of five possible reasons.

  abstract: Automatic analysis of poetic rhythm is a challenging task that involves
    linguistics, literature, and computer science. When the language to be analyzed
    is known, rule-based systems or data-driven methods can be used. In this paper,
    we analyze poetic rhythm in English and Spanish. We show that the representations
    of data learned from character-based neural models are more informative than the
    ones from hand-crafted features, and that a Bi-LSTM+CRF-model produces state-of-the
    art accuracy on scansion of poetry in two languages. Results also show that the
    information about whole word structure, and not just independent syllables, is
    highly informative for performing scansion.

  abstract: This paper is an attempt to exclusively focus on investigating the pivot
    language technique in which a bridging language is utilized to increase the quality
    of the Persian-Spanish low-resource Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). In
    this case, English is used as the bridging language, and the Persian-English SMT
    is combined with the English-Spanish one, where the relatively large corpora of
    each may be used in support of the Persian-Spanish pairing. Our results indicate
    that the pivot language technique outperforms the direct SMT processes currently
    in use between Persian and Spanish. Furthermore, we investigate the sentence translation
    pivot strategy and the phrase translation in turn, and demonstrate that, in the
    context of the Persian-Spanish SMT system, the phrase-level pivoting outperforms
    the sentence-level pivoting. Finally we suggest a method called combination model
    in which the standard direct model and the best triangulation pivoting model are
    blended in order to reach a high-quality translation.

  abstract: Stance classification determines the attitude, or stance, in a (typically
    short) text. The task has powerful applications, such as the detection of fake
    news or the automatic extraction of attitudes toward entities or events in the
    media. This paper describes a surprisingly simple and efficient classification
    approach to open stance classification in Twitter, for rumour and veracity classification.
    The approach profits from a novel set of automatically identifiable problem-specific
    features, which significantly boost classifier accuracy and achieve above state-of-the-art
    results on recent benchmark datasets. This calls into question the value of using
    complex sophisticated models for stance classification without first doing informed
    feature extraction.

  abstract: We present GATE DictLemmatizer, a multilingual open source lemmatizer
    for the GATE NLP framework that currently supports English, German, Italian, French,
    Dutch, and Spanish, and is easily extensible to other languages. The software
    is freely available under the LGPL license. The lemmatization is based on the
    Helsinki Finite-State Transducer Technology (HFST) and lemma dictionaries automatically
    created from Wiktionary. We evaluate the performance of the lemmatizers against
    TreeTagger, which is only freely available for research purposes. Our evaluation
    shows that DictLemmatizer achieves similar or even better results than TreeTagger
    for languages where there is support from HFST. The performance drops when there
    is no support from HFST and the entire lemmatization process is based on lemma
    dictionaries. However, the results are still satisfactory given the fact that
    DictLemmatizer isopen-source and can be easily extended to other languages. The
    software for extending the lemmatizer by creating word lists from Wiktionary dictionaries
    is also freely available as open-source software.

  abstract: A number of machine translation methods have been proposed in recent years
    to deal with the increasingly important problem of automatic translation between
    texts of different languages or languages and their dialects. These methods have
    produced promising results when applied to some of the widely studied languages.
    Existing translation methods are mainly implemented using rule-based and static
    machine translation approaches. Rule based approaches utilize language translation
    rules that can either be constructed by an expert, which is quite difficult when
    dealing with dialects, or rely on rule construction algorithms, which require
    very large parallel datasets. Statistical approaches also require large parallel
    datasets to build the translation models. However, large parallel datasets do
    not exist for languages with low resources, such as the Arabic language and its
    dialects. In this paper we propose an algorithm that attempts to overcome this
    limitation, and apply it to translate the Egyptian dialect (EGY) to Modern Standard
    Arabic (MSA). Monolingual corpus was collected for both MSA and EGY and a relatively
    small parallel language pair set was built to train the models. The proposed method
    utilizes Word embedding as it requires monolingual data rather than parallel corpus.
    Both Continuous Bag of Words and Skip-gram were used to build word vectors. The
    proposed method was validated on four different datasets using a four-fold cross
    validation approach.

  abstract: "This paper presents the development of a natural language inference engine\
    \ that benefits from two current standard approaches; i.e., shallow and deep approaches.\
    \ This system combines two non-deterministic algorithms: the approximate matching\
    \ from the shallow approach and a theorem prover from the deep approach for handling\
    \ multi-step inference tasks. The theorem prover is customized to accept dependency\
    \ trees and apply inference rules to these trees. The inference rules are automatically\
    \ generated as syllogistic rules from our test data (FraCaS test suite). The theorem\
    \ prover exploits a non-deterministic matching algorithm within a standard backward\
    \ chaining inference engine. We employ continuation programming as a way of seamlessly\
    \ handling the combination of these two non-deterministic algorithms. Testing\
    \ the matching algorithm on \u201CGeneralized quantifiers\u201D and \u201Cadjectives\u201D\
    \ topics in FraCaS (MacCartney and Manning 2007), we achieved an accuracy of 92.8%\
    \ of the single-premise cases. For the multi-steps of inference, we checked the\
    \ validity of our syllogistic rules and then extracted four generic instances\
    \ that can be applied to more than one problem."

  abstract: 'The last years witnessed an increasing interest in the automatic methods
    for spotting false translation units in translation memories. This problem presents
    a great interest to industry as there are many translation memories that contain
    errors. A closely related line of research deals with identifying sentences that
    do not align in the parallel corpora mined from the web. The task of spotting
    false translations is modeled as a binary classification problem. It is known
    that in certain conditions the ensembles of classifiers improve over the performance
    of the individual members. In this paper we benchmark the most popular ensemble
    of classifiers: Majority Voting, Bagging, Stacking and Ada Boost at the task of
    spotting false translation units for translation memories and parallel web corpora.
    We want to know if for this specific problem any ensemble technique improves the
    performance of the individual classifiers and if there is a difference between
    the data in translation memories and parallel web corpora with respect to this
    task.'

  abstract: This paper evaluates different techniques for building a supervised, multilanguage
    keyphrase extraction pipeline for languages which lack a gold standard. Starting
    from an unsupervised English keyphrase extraction pipeline, we implement pipelines
    for Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian, and we build test collections for
    languages which lack one. Then, we add a Machine Learning module trained on a
    well-known English language corpus and we evaluate the performance not only over
    English but on the other languages as well. Finally, we repeat the same evaluation
    after training the pipeline over an Arabic language corpus to check whether using
    a language-specific corpus brings a further improvement in performance. On the
    five languages we analyzed, results show an improvement in performance when using
    a machine learning algorithm, even if such algorithm is not trained and tested
    on the same language.

  abstract: In this paper, we implement a multilingual Statistical Machine Translation
    (SMT) system for Arabic-English Translation. Arabic Text can be categorized into
    standard and dialectal Arabic. These two forms of Arabic differ significantly.
    Different mono-lingual and multi-lingual hybrid SMT approaches are compared. Mono-lingual
    systems do always results in better translation accuracy in one Arabic form and
    poor accuracy in the other. Multi-lingual SMT models that are trained with pooled
    parallel MSA/dialectal data result in better accuracy. However, since the available
    parallel MSA data are much larger compared to dialectal data, multilingual models
    are biased to MSA. We propose in the work, a multi-lingual combination of different
    mono-lingual systems using an Arabic form classifier. The outcome of the classier
    directs the system to use the appropriate mono-lingual models (standard, dialectal,
    or mixture). Testing the different SMT systems shows that the proposed classifier-based
    SMT system outperforms mono-lingual and data pooled multi-lingual systems.

  abstract: Paraphrases exist on different granularity levels, the most frequently
    used one being the sentential level. However, we argue that working on the sentential
    level is not optimal for both machines and humans, and that it would be easier
    and more efficient to work on sub-sentential levels. To prove this, we quantify
    and analyze the difference between paraphrases on both sentence and sub-sentence
    level in order to show the significance of the problem. First results on a preliminary
    dataset seem to confirm our hypotheses.

  abstract: Manual text annotation is an essential part of Big Text analytics. Although
    annotators work with limited parts of data sets, their results are extrapolated
    by automated text classification and affect the final classification results.
    Reliability of annotations and adequacy of assigned labels are especially important
    in the case of sentiment annotations. In the current study we examine inter-annotator
    agreement in multi-class, multi-label sentiment annotation of messages. We used
    several annotation agreement measures, as well as statistical analysis and Machine
    Learning to assess the resulting annotations.

  abstract: Decision trees have been previously employed in many machine-learning
    tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, morphological-attribute resolution,
    letter-to-sound conversion and statistical-parametric speech synthesis. In this
    paper we introduce an optimized tree-computation algorithm, which is based on
    the original ID3 algorithm. We also introduce a tree-pruning method that uses
    a development set to delete nodes from over-fitted models. The later mentioned
    algorithm also uses a results caching method for speed-up. Our algorithm is almost
    200 times faster than a naive implementation and yields accurate results on our
    test datasets.

  abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to select sentences for automatic summarization
    based on an evolutionary algorithm. The algorithm explores candidate summaries
    space following an objective function computed over ngrams probability distributions
    of the candidate summary and the source documents. This method does not consider
    a summary as a stack of independent sentences but as a whole text, and makes use
    of advances in unsupervised summarization evaluation. We compare this sentence
    extraction method to one of the best existing methods which is based on integer
    linear programming, and show its efficiency on three different acknowledged corpora.

  abstract: We propose to use question answering (QA) data from Web forums to train
    chat-bots from scratch, i.e., without dialog data. First, we extract pairs of
    question and answer sentences from the typically much longer texts of questions
    and answers in a forum. We then use these shorter texts to train seq2seq models
    in a more efficient way. We further improve the parameter optimization using a
    new model selection strategy based on QA measures. Finally, we propose to use
    extrinsic evaluation with respect to a QA task as an automatic evaluation method
    for chatbot systems. The evaluation shows that the model achieves a MAP of 63.5%
    on the extrinsic task. Moreover, our manual evaluation demonstrates that the model
    can answer correctly 49.5% of the questions when they are similar in style to
    how questions are asked in the forum, and 47.3% of the questions, when they are
    more conversational in style.

  abstract: 'Shallow text analysis (Text Mining) uses mainly Information Extraction
    techniques. The low resource languages do not allow application of such traditional
    techniques with sufficient accuracy and recall on big data. In contrast, Data
    Mining approaches provide an opportunity to make deep analysis and to discover
    new knowledge. Frequent pattern mining approaches are used mainly for structured
    information in databases and are a quite challenging task in text mining. Unfortunately,
    most frequent pattern mining approaches do not use contextual information for
    extracted patterns: general patterns are extracted regardless of the context.
    We propose a method that processes raw informal texts (from health discussion
    forums) and formal texts (outpatient records) in Bulgarian language. In addition
    we use some context information and small terminological lexicons to generalize
    extracted frequent patterns. This allows to map informal expression of medical
    terminology to the formal one and to generate automatically resources.'

  abstract: 'Named Entity Recognition (NER) poses new challenges in real-world documents
    in which there are entities with different roles according to their purpose or
    meaning. Retrieving all the possible entities in scenarios in which only a subset
    of them based on their role is needed, produces noise on the overall precision.
    This work proposes a NER model that relies on role classification models that
    support recognizing entities with a specific role. The proposed model has been
    implemented in two use cases using Spanish drug Summary of Product Characteristics:
    identification of therapeutic indications and identification of adverse reactions.
    The results show how precision is increased using a NER model that is oriented
    towards a specific role and discards entities out of scope.'

  abstract: 'Emotion detection has a high potential positive impact on the benefit
    of business, society, politics or education. Given this, the main objective of
    our research is to contribute to the resolution of one of the most important challenges
    in textual emotion detection: emotional corpora annotation. This will be tackled
    by proposing a semi-automatic methodology. It consists in two main phases: (1)
    an automatic process to pre-annotate the unlabelled sentences with a reduced number
    of emotional categories; and (2) a manual process of refinement where human annotators
    will determine which is the dominant emotion between the pre-defined set. Our
    objective in this paper is to show the pre-annotation process, as well as to evaluate
    the usability of subjective and polarity information in this process. The evaluation
    performed confirms clearly the benefits of employing the polarity and subjective
    information on emotion detection and thus endorses the relevance of our approach.'

  abstract: Radiology reports express the results of a radiology study and contain
    information about anatomical entities, findings, measures and impressions of the
    medical doctor. The use of information extraction techniques can help physicians
    to access this information in order to understand data and to infer further knowledge.
    Supervised machine learning methods are very popular to address information extraction,
    but are usually domain and language dependent. To train new classification models,
    annotated data is required. Moreover, annotated data is also required as an evaluation
    resource of information extraction algorithms. However, one major drawback of
    processing clinical data is the low availability of annotated datasets. For this
    reason we performed a manual annotation of radiology reports written in Spanish.
    This paper presents the corpus, the annotation schema, the annotation guidelines
    and further insight of the data.

  abstract: We investigate parsing replicability across 7 languages (and 8 treebanks),
    showing that choices concerning the use of grammatical functions in parsing or
    evaluation, the influence of the rare word threshold, as well as choices in test
    sentences and evaluation script options have considerable and often unexpected
    effects on parsing accuracies. All of those choices need to be carefully documented
    if we want to ensure replicability.

  abstract: The automatic identification of discourse relations is still a challenging
    task in natural language processing. Discourse connectives, such as since or but,
    are the most informative cues to identify explicit relations; however discourse
    parsers typically use a closed inventory of such connectives. As a result, discourse
    relations signalled by markers outside these inventories (i.e. AltLexes) are not
    detected as effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel method to leverage
    parallel corpora in text simplification and lexical resources to automatically
    identify alternative lexicalizations that signal discourse relation. When applied
    to the Simple Wikipedia and Newsela corpora along with WordNet and the PPDB, the
    method allowed the automatic discovery of 91 AltLexes.

  abstract: "In this article we propose a stylistic analysis of Solomon Marcus\u2019\
    \ non-scientific published texts, gathered in six volumes, aiming to uncover some\
    \ of his quantitative and qualitative fingerprints. Moreover, we compare and cluster\
    \ two distinct periods of time in his writing style: 22 years of communist regime\
    \ (1967-1989) and 27 years of democracy (1990-2016). The distributional analysis\
    \ of Marcus\u2019 text reveals that the passing from the communist regime period\
    \ to democracy is sharply marked by two complementary changes in Marcus\u2019\
    \ writing: in the pre-democracy period, the communist norms of writing style demanded\
    \ on the one hand long phrases, long words and clich\xE9s, and on the other hand,\
    \ a short list of preferred \u201Cofficial\u201D topics; in democracy tendency\
    \ was towards shorten phrases and words while approaching a broader area of topics."

  abstract: Detecting which tweets describe a specific event and clustering them is
    one of the main challenging tasks related to Social Media currently addressed
    in the NLP community. Existing approaches have mainly focused on detecting spikes
    in clusters around specific keywords or Named Entities (NE). However, one of the
    main drawbacks of such approaches is the difficulty in understanding when the
    same keywords describe different events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
    that exploits NE mentions in tweets and their entity context to create a temporal
    event graph. Then, using simple graph theory techniques and a PageRank-like algorithm,
    we process the event graphs to detect clusters of tweets describing the same events.
    Experiments on two gold standard datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
    results both in terms of evaluation performances and the quality of the detected
    events.

  abstract: In this paper, we present the first attempts to develop a machine translation
    (MT) system between Spanish and Shipibo-konibo (es-shp). There are very few digital
    texts written in Shipibo-konibo and even less bilingual texts that can be aligned,
    hence we had to create a parallel corpus using both bilingual and monolingual
    texts. We will describe how this corpus was made, as well as the process we followed
    to improve the quality of the sentences used to build a statistical MT model or
    SMT. The results obtained surpassed the baseline proposed (dictionary based) and
    made a promising result for further development considering the size of corpus
    used. Finally, it is expected that this MT system can be reinforced with the use
    of additional linguistic rules and automatic language processing functions that
    are being implemented.

  abstract: We demo a chat bot with the focus on complex, multi-sentence questions
    that enforce what we call rhetoric agreement of answers with questions. Chat bot
    finds answers which are not only relevant by topic but also match the question
    by style, argumentation patterns, communication means, experience level and other
    attributes. The system achieves rhetoric agreement by learning pairs of discourse
    trees (DTs) for question (Q) and answer (A). We build a library of best answer
    DTs for most types of complex questions. To better recognize a valid rhetoric
    agreement between Q and A, DTs are extended with the labels for communicative
    actions. An algorithm for finding the best DT for an A, given a Q, is evaluated.

  abstract: In the wake of a polarizing election, the cyber world is laden with hate
    speech. Context accompanying a hate speech text is useful for identifying hate
    speech, which however has been largely overlooked in existing datasets and hate
    speech detection models. In this paper, we provide an annotated corpus of hate
    speech with context information well kept. Then we propose two types of hate speech
    detection models that incorporate context information, a logistic regression model
    with context features and a neural network model with learning components for
    context. Our evaluation shows that both models outperform a strong baseline by
    around 3% to 4% in F1 score and combining these two models further improve the
    performance by another 7% in F1 score.

  abstract: 'In the context of investigative journalism, we address the problem of
    automatically identifying which claims in a given document are most worthy and
    should be prioritized for fact-checking. Despite its importance, this is a relatively
    understudied problem. Thus, we create a new corpus of political debates, containing
    statements that have been fact-checked by nine reputable sources, and we train
    machine learning models to predict which claims should be prioritized for fact-checking,
    i.e., we model the problem as a ranking task. Unlike previous work, which has
    looked primarily at sentences in isolation, in this paper we focus on a rich input
    representation modeling the context: relationship between the target statement
    and the larger context of the debate, interaction between the opponents, and reaction
    by the moderator and by the public. Our experiments show state-of-the-art results,
    outperforming a strong rivaling system by a margin, while also confirming the
    importance of the contextual information.'

  abstract: Rich data provided by tweets have beenanalyzed, clustered, and explored
    in a variety of studies. Typically those studies focus on named entity recognition,
    entity linking, and entity disambiguation or clustering. Tweets and hashtags are
    generally analyzed on sentential or word level but not on a compositional level
    of concatenated words. We propose an approach for a closer analysis of compounds
    in hashtags, and in the long run also of other types of text sequences in tweets,
    in order to enhance the clustering of such text documents. Hashtags have been
    used before as primary topic indicators to cluster tweets, however, their segmentation
    and its effect on clustering results have not been investigated to the best of
    our knowledge. Our results with a standard dataset from the Text REtrieval Conference
    (TREC) show that segmented and harmonized hashtags positively impact effective
    clustering.

  abstract: Nowadays, search for documents on the Internet is becoming increasingly
    difficult. The reason is the amount of content published by users (articles, comments,
    blogs, reviews). How to facilitate that the users can find their required documents?
    What would be necessary to provide useful document meta-data for supporting search
    engines? In this article, we present a study of some Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) technologies that can be useful for facilitating the proper identification
    of documents according to the user needs. For this purpose, it is designed a document
    profile that will be able to represent semantic meta-data extracted from documents
    by using NLP technologies. The research is basically focused on the study of different
    NLP technologies in order to support the creation our novel document profile proposal
    from semantic perspectives.

  abstract: "Since the advent of word embedding methods, the representation of longer\
    \ pieces of texts such as sentences and paragraphs is gaining more and more interest,\
    \ especially for textual similarity tasks. Mikolov et al. (2013) have demonstrated\
    \ that words and phrases exhibit linear structures that allow to meaningfully\
    \ combine words by an element-wise addition of their vector representations. Recently,\
    \ Arora et al. (2017) have shown that removing the projections of the weighted\
    \ average sum of word embedding vectors on their first principal components, outperforms\
    \ sophisticated supervised methods including RNN\u2019s and LSTM\u2019s. Inspired\
    \ by Mikolov et al. (2013) and Arora et al. (2017) findings and by a bilingual\
    \ word mapping technique presented in Artetxe et al. (2016), we introduce MappSent,\
    \ a novel approach for textual similarity. Based on a linear sentence embedding\
    \ representation, its principle is to build a matrix that maps sentences in a\
    \ joint-subspace where similar sets of sentences are pushed closer. We evaluate\
    \ our approach on the SemEval 2016/2017 question-to-question similarity task and\

  abstract: Figurative language such as irony, sarcasm, and metaphor is considered
    a significant challenge in sentiment analysis. These figurative devices can sculpt
    the affect of an utterance and test the limits of sentiment analysis of supposedly
    literal texts. We explore the effect of figurative language on sentiment analysis.
    We incorporate the figurative language indicators into the sentiment analysis
    process and compare the results with and without the additional information about
    them. We evaluate on the SemEval-2015 Task 11 data and outperform the first team
    with our convolutional neural network model and additional training data in terms
    of mean squared error and we follow closely behind the first place in terms of
    cosine similarity.

  abstract: Argument labeling of explicit discourse relations is a challenging task.
    The state of the art systems achieve slightly above 55% F-measure but require
    hand-crafted features. In this paper, we propose a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
    based model for argument labeling. We experimented with multiple configurations
    of our model. Using the PDTB dataset, our best model achieved an F1 measure of
    23.05% without any feature engineering. This is significantly higher than the
    20.52% achieved by the state of the art RNN approach, but significantly lower
    than the feature based state of the art systems. On the other hand, because our
    approach learns only from the raw dataset, it is more widely applicable to multiple
    textual genres and languages.

  abstract: Parsing Chinese critically depends on correct word segmentation for the
    parser since incorrect segmentation inevitably causes incorrect parses. We investigate
    a pipeline approach to segmentation and parsing using word lattices as parser
    input. We compare CRF-based and lexicon-based approaches to word segmentation.
    Our results show that the lattice parser is capable of selecting the correction
    segmentation from thousands of options, thus drastically reducing the number of
    unparsed sentence. Lexicon-based parsing models have a better coverage than the
    CRF-based approach, but the many options are more difficult to handle. We reach
    our best result by using a lexicon from the n-best CRF analyses, combined with
    highly probable words.

  abstract: "Today\u2019s massive news streams demand the automate analysis which\
    \ is provided by various online news explorers. However, most of them do not provide\
    \ sentiment analysis. The main problem of sentiment analysis of news is the differences\
    \ between the writers and readers attitudes to the news text. News can be good\
    \ or bad but have to be delivered in neutral words as pure facts. Although there\
    \ are applications for sentiment analysis of news, the task of news analysis is\
    \ still a very actual problem because the latest news impacts people\u2019s lives\
    \ daily. In this paper, we explored the problem of sentiment analysis for Ukrainian\
    \ and Russian news, developed a corpus of Ukrainian and Russian news and annotated\
    \ each text using one of three categories: positive, negative and neutral. Each\
    \ text was marked by at least three independent annotators via the web interface,\
    \ the inter-annotator agreement was analyzed and the final label for each text\
    \ was computed. These texts were used in the machine learning experiments. Further,\
    \ we investigated what kinds of named entities such as Locations, Organizations,\
    \ Persons are perceived as good or bad by the readers and which of them were the\
    \ cause for text annotation ambiguity."

  abstract: 'Given the constantly growing proliferation of false claims online in
    recent years, there has been also a growing research interest in automatically
    distinguishing false rumors from factually true claims. Here, we propose a general-purpose
    framework for fully-automatic fact checking using external sources, tapping the
    potential of the entire Web as a knowledge source to confirm or reject a claim.
    Our framework uses a deep neural network with LSTM text encoding to combine semantic
    kernels with task-specific embeddings that encode a claim together with pieces
    of potentially relevant text fragments from the Web, taking the source reliability
    into account. The evaluation results show good performance on two different tasks
    and datasets: (i) rumor detection and (ii) fact checking of the answers to a question
    in community question answering forums.'

  abstract: The purpose of this research is to address the problem of extracting information
    from travel itineraries and discuss the challenges faced in the process. Business-to-customer
    emails like booking confirmations and e-tickets are usually machine generated
    by filling slots in pre-defined templates which improve the presentation of such
    emails but also make the emails more complex in structure. Extracting the relevant
    information from these emails would let users track their journeys and important
    updates on applications installed on their devices to give them a consolidated
    over view of their itineraries and also save valuable time. We investigate the
    use of an HMM-based named entity recognizer on such emails which we will use to
    label and extract relevant entities. NER in such emails is challenging as these
    itineraries offer less useful contextual information. We also propose a rich set
    of features which are integrated into the model and are specific to our domain.
    The result from our model is a list of lists containing the relevant information
    extracted from ones itinerary.

  abstract: This paper presents an supervised approach to the recognition of Cross-document
    Structure Theory (CST) relations in Polish texts. In the proposed, graph-based
    representation is constructed for sentences. Graphs are built on the basis of
    lexicalised syntactic-semantic relation extracted from text. Similarity between
    sentences is calculated from graph, and the similarity values are input to classifiers
    trained by Logistic Model Tree. Several different configurations of graph, as
    well as graph similarity methods were analysed for this tasks. The approach was
    evaluated on a large open corpus annotated manually with 17 types of selected
    CST relations. The configuration of experiments was similar to those known from
    SEMEVAL and we obtained very promising results.

  abstract: Machine translation systems are very sensitive to the domains they were
    trained on. Several domain adaptation techniques have already been deeply studied.
    We propose a new technique for neural machine translation (NMT) that we call domain
    control which is performed at runtime using a unique neural network covering multiple
    domains. The presented approach shows quality improvements when compared to dedicated
    domains translating on any of the covered domains and even on out-of-domain data.
    In addition, model parameters do not need to be re-estimated for each domain,
    making this effective to real use cases. Evaluation is carried out on English-to-French
    translation for two different testing scenarios. We first consider the case where
    an end-user performs translations on a known domain. Secondly, we consider the
    scenario where the domain is not known and predicted at the sentence level before
    translating. Results show consistent accuracy improvements for both conditions.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce WoRel, a model that jointly learns word embeddings
    and a semantic representation of word relations. The model learns from plain text
    sentences and their dependency parse trees. The word embeddings produced by WoRel
    outperform Skip-Gram and GloVe in word similarity and syntactical word analogy
    tasks and have comparable results on word relatedness and semantic word analogy
    tasks. We show that the semantic representation of relations enables us to express
    the meaning of phrases and is a promising research direction for semantics at
    the sentence level.

  abstract: The naive approach to annotation projection is not effective to project
    discourse annotations from one language to another because implicit relations
    are often changed to explicit ones and vice-versa in the translation. In this
    paper, we propose a novel approach based on the intersection between statistical
    word-alignment models to identify unsupported discourse annotations. This approach
    identified 65% of the unsupported annotations in the English-French parallel sentences
    from Europarl. By filtering out these unsupported annotations, we induced the
    first PDTB-style discourse annotated corpus for French from Europarl. We then
    used this corpus to train a classifier to identify the discourse-usage of French
    discourse connectives and show a 15% improvement of F1-score compared to the classifier
    trained on the non-filtered annotations.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel supervised model for parsing natural
    language sentences into their formal semantic representations. This model treats
    sentence-to-lambda-logical expression conversion within the framework of the statistical
    machine translation with forest-to-tree algorithm. To make this work, we transform
    the lambda-logical expression structure into a form suitable for the mechanics
    of statistical machine translation and useful for modeling. We show that our model
    is able to yield new state-of-the-art results on both standard datasets with simple
    features.

  abstract: Social media platforms play a crucial role in piecing together global
    news stories via their corresponding online discussions. Thus, in this work, we
    introduce the problem of automatically summarizing massively multilingual microblog
    text streams. We discuss the challenges involved in both generating summaries
    as well as evaluating them. We introduce a simple word graph based approach that
    utilizes node neighborhoods to identify keyphrases and thus in turn, pick summary
    candidates. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating
    precise summaries as compared to other popular techniques.

  abstract: In this paper we examine methods to detect hate speech in social media,
    while distinguishing this from general profanity. We aim to establish lexical
    baselines for this task by applying supervised classification methods using a
    recently released dataset annotated for this purpose. As features, our system
    uses character n-grams, word n-grams and word skip-grams. We obtain results of
    78% accuracy in identifying posts across three classes. Results demonstrate that
    the main challenge lies in discriminating profanity and hate speech from each
    other. A number of directions for future work are discussed.

  abstract: To alleviate data sparsity in spoken Uyghur machine translation, we proposed
    a log-linear based morphological segmentation approach. Instead of learning model
    only from monolingual annotated corpus, this approach optimizes Uyghur segmentation
    for spoken translation based on both bilingual and monolingual corpus. Our approach
    relies on several features such as traditional conditional random field (CRF)
    feature, bilingual word alignment feature and monolingual suffixword co-occurrence
    feature. Experimental results shown that our proposed segmentation model for Uyghur
    spoken translation achieved 1.6 BLEU score improvements compared with the state-of-the-art
    baseline.

  abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important component of natural language
    processing (NLP), with applicability in biomedical domain, enabling knowledge-discovery
    from medical texts. Due to the fact that for the Romanian language there are only
    a few linguistic resources specific to the biomedical domain, it was created a
    sub-corpus specific to this domain. In this paper we present a newly developed
    Romanian sub-corpus for medical-domain NER, which is a valuable asset for the
    field of biomedical text processing. We provide a description of the sub-corpus,
    informative statistics about data-composition and we evaluate an automatic NER
    tool on the newly created resource.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a Named Entity Classification system, which employs
    machine learning. Our methodology employs local entity information and profiles
    as feature set. All features are generated in an unsupervised manner. It is tested
    on two different data sets: (i) DrugSemantics Spanish corpus (Overall F1 = 74.92),
    whose results are in-line with the state of the art without employing external
    domain-specific resources. And, (ii) English CONLL2003 dataset (Overall F1 = 81.40),
    although our results are lower than previous work, these are reached without external
    knowledge or complex linguistic analysis. Last, using the same configuration for
    the two corpora, the difference of overall F1 is only 6.48 points (DrugSemantics
    = 74.92 versus CoNLL2003 = 81.40). Thus, this result supports our hypothesis that
    our approach is language and domain independent and does not require any external
    knowledge or complex linguistic analysis.'

  abstract: 'POS tagging and dependency parsing achieve good results for homogeneous
    datasets. However, these tasks are much more difficult on heterogeneous datasets.
    In (Mukherjee et al. 2016, 2017), we address this issue by creating genre experts
    for both POS tagging and parsing. We use topic modeling to automatically separate
    training and test data into genres and to create annotation experts per genre
    by training separate models for each topic. However, this approach assumes that
    topic modeling is performed jointly on training and test sentences each time a
    new test sentence is encountered. We extend this work by assigning new test sentences
    to their genre expert by using similarity metrics. We investigate three different
    types of methods: 1) based on words highly associated with a genre by the topic
    modeler, 2) using a k-nearest neighbor classification approach, and 3) using perplexity
    to determine the closest topic. The results show that the choice of similarity
    metric has an effect on results and that we can reach comparable accuracies to
    the joint topic modeling in POS tagging and dependency parsing, thus providing
    a viable and efficient approach to POS tagging and parsing a sentence by its genre
    expert.'

  abstract: We propose a new task of automatically detecting reputation defence strategies
    in the field of computational argumentation. We cast the problem as relation classification,
    where given a pair of reputation threat and reputation defence, we determine the
    reputation defence strategy. We annotate a dataset of parliamentary questions
    and answers with reputation defence strategies. We then propose a model based
    on supervised learning to address the detection of these strategies, and report
    promising experimental results.

    Media Frames Corpus compiled from the U.S. Newspapers. Using (B)LSTMs and GRU
    networks to represent the meaning of frames, we demonstrate that our approach
    yields at least 14-point improvement over several baseline methods.

    \ more robust with respect to some specific deficiencies of the parameter tuning\
    \ algorithms. This is an under-explored research direction, which can allow better\

    \ the potential of the idea with the pairwise ranking optimization (PRO) optimizer,\
    \ which is known to yield too short translations. We show that the learning problem\
    \ can be alleviated by tuning on a subset of the development set, selected based\
    \ on sentence length. In particular, using the longest 50% of the tuning sentences,\
    \ we achieve two-fold tuning speedup, and improvements in BLEU score that rival\

  abstract: We address information credibility in community forums, in a setting in
    which the credibility of an answer posted in a question thread by a particular
    user has to be predicted. First, we motivate the problem and we create a publicly
    available annotated English corpus by crowdsourcing. Second, we propose a large
    set of features to predict the credibility of the answers. The features model
    the user, the answer, the question, the thread as a whole, and the interaction
    between them. Our experiments with ranking SVMs show that the credibility labels
    can be predicted with high performance according to several standard IR ranking
    metrics, thus supporting the potential usage of this layer of credibility information
    in practical applications. The features modeling the profile of the user (in particular
    trollness) turn out to be most important, but embedding features modeling the
    answer and the similarity between the question and the answer are also very relevant.
    Overall, half of the gap between the baseline performance and the perfect classifier
    can be covered using the proposed features.

  abstract: The present paper describes the identification of prominent characters
    and their adjectives from Indian mythological epic, Mahabharata, written in English
    texts. However, in contrast to the tra-ditional approaches of named entity identifica-tion,
    the present system extracts hidden attributes associated with each of the characters
    (e.g., character adjectives). We observed distinct phrase level linguistic patterns
    that hint the pres-ence of characters in different text spans. Such six patterns
    were used in order to extract the cha-racters. On the other hand, a distinguishing
    set of novel features (e.g., multi-word expression, nodes and paths of parse tree,
    immediate ancestors etc.) was employed. Further, the correlation of the features
    is also measured in order to identify the important features. Finally, we applied
    various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression,
    Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.) along with deep learning to classify the patterns
    as characters or non-characters in order to achieve decent accuracy. Evaluation
    shows that phrase level linguistic patterns as well as the adopted features are
    highly active in capturing characters and their adjectives.

  abstract: Gender identification in social networks is one of the most popular aspects
    of user profile learning. Traditionally it has been linked to author profiling,
    a difficult problem to solve because of the little difference in the use of language
    between genders. This situation has led to the need of taking into account other
    information apart from textual data, favoring the emergence of multimodal data.
    The aim of this paper is to apply neural networks to perform data fusion, using
    an existing multimodal corpus, the NUS-MSS data set, that (not only) contains

  abstract: In this article we present the result of the recent research in the recognition
    of genuine Polish suicide notes (SNs). We provide useful method to distinguish
    between SNs and other types of discourse, including counterfeited SNs. The method
    uses a wide range of word-based and semantic features and it was evaluated using
    Polish Corpus of Suicide Notes, which contains 1244 genuine SNs, expanded with
    manually prepared set of 334 counterfeited SNs and 2200 letter-like texts from
    the Internet. We utilized the algorithm to create the class-related sense dictionaries
    to improve the result of SNs classification. The obtained results show that there
    are fundamental differences between genuine SNs and counterfeited SNs. The applied
    method of the sense dictionary construction appeared to be the best way of improving
    the model.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce a cross-lingual Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
    system with language independent features based upon Universal Dependencies. We
    propose two methods to convert SRL annotations from monolingual dependency trees
    into universal dependency trees. Our SRL system is based upon cross-lingual features
    derived from universal dependency trees and a supervised learning that utilizes
    a maximum entropy classifier. We design experiments to verify whether the Universal
    Dependencies are suitable for the cross-lingual SRL. The results are very promising
    and they open new interesting research paths for the future.

  abstract: 'In recent years gaze data has been increasingly used to improve and evaluate
    NLP models due to the fact that it carries information about the cognitive processing
    of linguistic phenomena. In this paper we conduct a preliminary study towards
    the automatic identification of multiword expressions based on gaze features from
    native and non-native speakers of English. We report comparisons between a part-of-speech
    (POS) and frequency baseline to: i) a prediction model based solely on gaze data
    and ii) a combined model of gaze data, POS and frequency. In spite of the challenging
    nature of the task, best performance was achieved by the latter. Furthermore,
    we explore how the type of gaze data (from native versus non-native speakers)
    affects the prediction, showing that data from the two groups is discriminative
    to an equal degree for the task. Finally, we show that late processing measures
    are more predictive than early ones, which is in line with previous research on
    idioms and other formulaic structures.'

  abstract: Real-time summarization of news events (RTS) allows persons to stay up-to-date
    on important topics that develop over time. With the occurrence of major sub-events,
    media attention increases and a large number of news articles are published. We
    propose a summarization approach that detects such changes and selects a suitable
    summarization configuration at run-time. In particular, at times with high media
    attention, our approach exploits the redundancy in content to produce a more precise
    summary and avoid emitting redundant information. We find that our approach significantly
    outperforms a strong non-adaptive RTS baseline in terms of the emitted summary
    updates and achieves the best results on a recent web-scale dataset. It can successfully
    be applied to a different real-world dataset without requiring additional modifications.

  abstract: In human language, an expression could be conveyed in many ways by different
    people. Even that the same person may express same sentence quite differently
    when addressing different audiences, using different modalities, or using different
    syntactic variations or may use different set of vocabulary. The possibility of
    such endless surface form of text while the meaning of the text remains almost
    same, poses many challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems like
    question-answering system, machine translation system and text summarization.
    This research paper is an endeavor to understand the characteristic of such endless
    semantic divergence. In this research work we develop a corpus of 1525 semantic
    divergent sentences for 200 English tweets.

  abstract: Unknown words are a challenge for any NLP task, including sentiment analysis.
    Here, we evaluate the extent to which sentiment polarity of complex words can
    be predicted based on their morphological make-up. We do this on German as it
    has very productive processes of derivation and compounding and many German hapax
    words, which are likely to bear sentiment, are morphologically complex. We present
    results of supervised classification experiments on new datasets with morphological
    parses and polarity annotations.

  abstract: "Sentiment analysis is the computational task of extracting sentiment\
    \ from a text document \u2013 for example whether it expresses a positive, negative\
    \ or neutral opinion. Various approaches have been introduced in recent years,\
    \ using a range of different techniques to extract sentiment information from\
    \ a document. Measuring these methods against a gold standard dataset is a useful\
    \ way to evaluate such systems. However, different sentiment analysis techniques\
    \ represent sentiment values in different ways, such as discrete categorical classes\
    \ or continuous numerical sentiment scores. This creates a challenge for evaluating\
    \ and comparing such systems; in particular assessing numerical scores against\
    \ datasets that use fixed classes is difficult, because the numerical outputs\
    \ have to be mapped onto the ordered classes. This paper proposes a novel calibration\
    \ technique that uses precision vs. recall curves to set class thresholds to optimize\
    \ a continuous sentiment analyser\u2019s performance against a discrete gold standard\
    \ dataset. In experiments mapping a continuous score onto a three-class classification\
    \ of movie reviews, we show that calibration results in a substantial increase\
    \ in f-score when compared to a non-calibrated mapping."

  abstract: 'We describe in this paper a hybrid ap-proach to build automatically bilingual
    lexicons of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) from parallel corpora. We more specifically
    investigate the impact of using a domain-specific bilingual lexicon of MWEs on
    domain adaptation of an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system. We conducted
    experiments on the English-French language pair and two kinds of texts: in-domain
    texts from Europarl (European Parliament proceedings) and out-of-domain texts
    from Emea (European Medicines Agency documents) and Ecb (European Central Bank
    corpus). The obtained results indicate that integrating domain-specific bilingual
    lexicons of MWEs improves translation quality of the EBMT system when texts to
    translate are related to the specific domain and induces a relatively slight deterioration
    of translation quality when translating general-purpose texts.'

  abstract: "In this paper, we present a study for the identification of authors\u2019\
    \ national variety of English in texts from social media. In data from Facebook\
    \ and Twitter, information about the author\u2019s social profile is annotated,\
    \ and the national English variety (US, UK, AUS, CAN, NNS) that each author uses\
    \ is attributed. We tested four feature types: formal linguistic features, POS\
    \ features, lexicon-based features related to the different varieties, and data-based\
    \ features from each English variety. We used various machine learning algorithms\
    \ for the classification experiments, and we implemented a feature selection process.\
    \ The classification accuracy achieved, when the 31 highest ranked features were\
    \ used, was up to 77.32%. The experimental results are evaluated, and the efficacy\
    \ of the ranked features discussed."

  abstract: 'Word vectors with varying dimensionalities and produced by different
    algorithms have been extensively used in NLP. The corpora that the algorithms
    are trained on can contain either natural language text (e.g. Wikipedia or newswire
    articles) or artificially-generated pseudo corpora due to natural data sparseness.
    We exploit Lexical Chain based templates over Knowledge Graph for generating pseudo-corpora
    with controlled linguistic value. These corpora are then used for learning word
    embeddings. A number of experiments have been conducted over the following test
    sets: WordSim353 Similarity, WordSim353 Relatedness and SimLex-999. The results
    show that, on the one hand, the incorporation of many-relation lexical chains
    improves results, but on the other hand, unrestricted-length chains remain difficult
    to handle with respect to their huge quantity.'

  abstract: A common reason for errors in coreference resolution is the lack of semantic
    information to help determine the compatibility between mentions referring to
    the same entity. Distributed representations, which have been shown successful
    in encoding relatedness between words, could potentially be a good source of such
    knowledge. Moreover, being obtained in an unsupervised manner, they could help
    address data sparsity issues in labeled training data at a small cost. In this
    work we investigate whether and to what extend features derived from word embeddings
    can be successfully used for supervised coreference resolution. We experiment
    with several word embedding models, and several different types of embeddingbased
    features, including embedding cluster and cosine similarity-based features. Our
    evaluations show improvements in the performance of a supervised state-of-theart
    coreference system.

  abstract: We introduce Flames Detector, an online system for measuring flames, i.e.
    strong negative feelings or emotions, insults or other verbal offences, in news
    commentaries across five languages. It is designed to assist journalists, public
    institutions or discussion moderators to detect news topics which evoke wrangles.
    We propose a machine learning approach to flames detection and calculate an aggregated
    score for a set of comment threads. The demo application shows the most flaming
    topics of the current period in several language variants. The search functionality
    gives a possibility to measure flames in any topic specified by a query. The evaluation
    shows that the flame detection in discussions is a difficult task, however, the
    application can already reveal interesting information about the actual news discussions.

  abstract: We propose a novel metric for evaluating summary content coverage. The
    evaluation framework follows the Pyramid approach to measure how many summarization
    content units, considered important by human annotators, are contained in an automatic
    summary. Our approach automatizes the evaluation process, which does not need
    any manual intervention on the evaluated summary side. Our approach compares abstract
    meaning representations of each content unit mention and each summary sentence.
    We found that the proposed metric complements well the widely-used ROUGE metrics.

  abstract: 'We work on detecting positive or negative sentiment towards named entities
    in very large volumes of news articles. The aim is to monitor changes over time,
    as well as to work towards media bias detection by com-paring differences across
    news sources and countries. With view to applying the same method to dozens of
    languages, we use lin-guistically light-weight methods: searching for positive
    and negative terms in bags of words around entity mentions (also consid-ering
    negation). Evaluation results are good and better than a third-party baseline
    sys-tem, but precision is not sufficiently high to display the results publicly
    in our multilin-gual news analysis system Europe Media Monitor (EMM). In this
    paper, we focus on describing our effort to improve the English language results
    by avoiding the biggest sources of errors. We also present new work on using a
    syntactic parser to identify safe opinion recognition rules, such as predica-tive
    structures in which sentiment words di-rectly refer to an entity. The precision
    of this method is good, but recall is very low.'

  abstract: We introduce a language-independent, graph-based probabilistic model of
    morphology, which uses transformation rules operating on whole words instead of
    the traditional morphological segmentation. The morphological analysis of a set
    of words is expressed through a graph having words as vertices and structural
    relationships between words as edges. We define a probability distribution over
    such graphs and develop a sampler based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
    The sampling is applied in order to determine the strength of morphological relationships
    between words, filter out accidental similarities and reduce the set of rules
    necessary to explain the data. The model is evaluated on the task of finding pairs
    of morphologically similar words, as well as generating new words. The results
    are compared to a state-of-the-art segmentation-based approach.

  abstract: "The sentiment analysis task has been traditionally divided into lexicon\
    \ or machine learning approaches, but recently the use of word embeddings methods\
    \ have emerged, that provide powerful algorithms to allow semantic understanding\
    \ without the task of creating large amounts of annotated test data. One problem\
    \ with this type of binary classification, is that the sentiment output will be\
    \ in the form of \u20181\u2019 (positive) or \u20180\u2019 (negative) for the\
    \ string of text in the tweet, regardless if there are one or more entities referred\
    \ to in the text. This paper plans to enhance the word embeddings approach with\
    \ the deployment of a sentiment lexicon-based technique to appoint a total score\
    \ that indicates the polarity of opinion in relation to a particular entity or\
    \ entities. This type of sentiment classification is a way of associating a given\
    \ entity with the adjectives, adverbs, and verbs describing it, and extracting\
    \ the associated sentiment to try and infer if the text is positive or negative\
    \ in relation to the entity or entities."

  abstract: We present a method for detecting word sense changes by utilizing automatically
    induced word senses. Our method works on the level of individual senses and allows
    a word to have e.g. one stable sense and then add a novel sense that later experiences
    change. Senses are grouped based on polysemy to find linguistic concepts and we
    can find broadening and narrowing as well as novel (polysemous and homonymic)
    senses. We evaluate on a testset, present recall and estimates of the time between
    expected and found change.

  abstract: A huge body of continuously growing written knowledge is available on
    the web in the form of social media posts, RSS feeds, and news articles. Real-time
    information extraction from such high velocity, high volume text streams requires
    scalable, distributed natural language processing pipelines. We introduce such
    a system for fine-grained event recognition within the big data framework Flink,
    and demonstrate its capabilities for extracting and geo-locating mobility- and
    industry-related events from heterogeneous text sources. Performance analyses
    conducted on several large datasets show that our system achieves high throughput
    and maintains low latency, which is crucial when events need to be detected and
    acted upon in real-time. We also present promising experimental results for the
    event extraction component of our system, which recognizes a novel set of event

  abstract: Utilising effective features in machine learning-based natural language
    processing (NLP) is crucial in achieving good performance for a given NLP task.
    The paper describes a pilot study on the analysis of eye-tracking data during
    named entity (NE) annotation, aiming at obtaining insights into effective features
    for the NE recognition task. The eye gaze data were collected from 10 annotators
    and analysed regarding working time and fixation distribution. The results of
    the preliminary qualitative analysis showed that human annotators tend to look
    at broader contexts around the target NE than recent state-of-the-art automatic
    NE recognition systems and to use predicate argument relations to identify the
    NE categories.

  abstract: "Text comparison is an interesting though hard task, with many applications\
    \ in Natural Language Processing. This work introduces a new text-similarity measure,\
    \ which employs named-entities\u2019 information extracted from the texts and\
    \ the n-gram graphs\u2019 model for representing documents. Using OpenCalais as\
    \ a named-entity recognition service and the JINSECT toolkit for constructing\
    \ and managing n-gram graphs, the text similarity measure is embedded in a text\
    \ clustering algorithm (k-Means). The evaluation of the produced clusters with\
    \ various clustering validity metrics shows that the extraction of named entities\
    \ at a first step can be profitable for the time-performance of similarity measures\
    \ that are based on the n-gram graph representation without affecting the overall\
    \ performance of the NLP task."

  abstract: In this article we present a system that extracts information from pathology
    reports. The reports are written in Norwegian and contain free text describing
    prostate biopsies. Currently, these reports are manually coded for research and
    statistical purposes by trained experts at the Cancer Registry of Norway where
    the coders extract values for a set of predefined fields that are specific for
    prostate cancer. The presented system is rule based and achieves an average F-score
    of 0.91 for the fields Gleason grade, Gleason score, the number of biopsies that
    contain tumor tissue, and the orientation of the biopsies. The system also identifies
    reports that contain ambiguity or other content that should be reviewed by an
    expert. The system shows potential to encode the reports considerably faster,
    with less resources, and similar high quality to the manual encoding.

  abstract: Capabilities of detecting temporal and causal relations between two events
    can benefit many applications. Most of existing temporal relation classifiers
    were trained in a supervised manner. Instead, we explore the observation that
    regular event pairs show a consistent temporal relation despite of their various
    contexts and these rich contexts can be used to train a contextual temporal relation
    classifier, which can further recognize new temporal relation contexts and identify
    new regular event pairs. We focus on detecting after and before temporal relations
    and design a weakly supervised learning approach that extracts thousands of regular
    event pairs and learns a contextual temporal relation classifier simultaneously.
    Evaluation shows that the acquired regular event pairs are of high quality and
    contain rich commonsense knowledge and domain specific knowledge. In addition,
    the weakly supervised trained temporal relation classifier achieves comparable
    performance with the state-of-the-art supervised systems.

  abstract: Recent attempts at behaviour understanding through language grounding
    have shown that it is possible to automatically generate models for planning problems
    from textual instructions. One drawback of these approaches is that they either
    do not make use of the semantic structure behind the model elements identified
    in the text, or they manually incorporate a collection of concepts with semantic
    relationships between them. We call this collection of knowledge situation model.
    The situation model introduces additional context information to the model. It
    could also potentially reduce the complexity of the planning problem compared
    to models that do not use situation models. To address this problem, we propose
    an approach that automatically generates the situation model from textual instructions.
    The approach is able to identify various hierarchical, spatial, directional, and
    causal relations. We use the situation model to automatically generate planning
    problems in a PDDL notation and we show that the situation model reduces the complexity
    of the PDDL model in terms of number of operators and branching factor compared
    to planning models that do not make use of situation models.

  abstract: "Different approaches for behaviour understanding rely on textual instructions\
    \ to generate models of human behaviour. These approaches usually use state of\
    \ the art parsers to obtain the part of speech (POS) meaning and dependencies\
    \ of the words in the instructions. For them it is essential that the parser is\
    \ able to correctly annotate the instructions and especially the verbs as they\
    \ describe the actions of the person. State of the art parsers usually make errors\
    \ when annotating textual instructions, as they have short sentence structure\
    \ often in imperative form. The inability of the parser to identify the verbs\
    \ results in the inability of behaviour understanding systems to identify the\
    \ relevant actions. To address this problem, we propose a simple rule-based model\
    \ that attempts to correct any incorrectly annotated verbs. We argue that the\
    \ model is able to significantly improve the parser\u2019s performance without\
    \ the need of additional training data. We evaluate our approach by extracting\
    \ the actions from 61 textual instructions annotated only with the Stanford parser\
    \ and once again after applying our model. The results show a significant improvement\
    \ in the recognition rate when applying the rules (75% accuracy compared to 68%\
    \ without the rules, p-value < 0.001)."

  abstract: "This study presents SMILLE, a system that draws on the Noticing Hypothesis\
    \ and on input enhancements, addressing the lack of salience of grammatical infor\
    \ mation in online documents chosen by a given user. By means of input enhancements,\
    \ the system can draw the user\u2019s attention to grammar, which could possibly\
    \ lead to a higher intake per input ratio for metalinguistic information. The\
    \ system receives as input an online document and submits it to a combined processing\
    \ of parser and hand-written rules for detecting its grammatical structures. The\
    \ input text can be freely chosen by the user, providing a more engaging experience\
    \ and reflecting the user\u2019s interests. The system can enhance a total of\
    \ 107 fine-grained types of grammatical structures that are based on the CEFR.\
    \ An evaluation of some of those structures resulted in an overall precision of\
    \ 87%."

  abstract: The present paper considers the problem of dietary conflict detection
    from dish titles. The proposed method explores the semantics associated with the
    dish title in order to discover a certain or possible incompatibility of a particular
    dish with a particular diet. Dish titles are parts of the elusive and metaphoric
    gastronomy language, their processing can be viewed as a combination of short
    text and domain-specific texts analysis. We build our algorithm on the basis of
    a common knowledge lexical semantic network and show how such network can be used
    for domain specific short text processing.

  abstract: "In today\u2019s world, globalisation is not only affecting inter-culturalism\
    \ but also linking markets across the globe. Given that all markets are affecting\
    \ each other and are not only driven by fundamental data but also by sentiments,\
    \ sentiment analysis regarding the markets becomes a tool to predict, anticipate,\
    \ and milden future economic crises such as the one we faced in 2008. In this\
    \ paper, an approach to improve sentiment analysis by exploiting relationships\
    \ among different kinds of sentiment, together with supplementary information,\
    \ from and across various data sources is proposed."

  abstract: "There is no agreed upon standard for the evaluation of conversational\
    \ dialog systems, which are well-known to be hard to evaluate due to the difficulty\
    \ in pinning down metrics that will correspond to human judgements and the subjective\
    \ nature of human judgment itself. We explored the possibility of using Grice\u2019\
    s Maxims to evaluate effective communication in conversation. We collected some\
    \ system generated dialogs from popular conversational chatbots across the spectrum\
    \ and conducted a survey to see how the human judgements based on Gricean maxims\
    \ correlate, and if such human judgments can be used as an effective evaluation\
    \ metric for conversational dialog."

  abstract: "This paper presents a neural network architecture for word sense disambiguation\
    \ (WSD). The architecture employs recurrent neural layers and more specifically\
    \ LSTM cells, in order to capture information about word order and to easily incorporate\
    \ distributed word representations (embeddings) as features, without having to\
    \ use a fixed window of text. The paper demonstrates that the architecture is\
    \ able to compete with the most successful supervised systems for WSD and that\
    \ there is an abundance of possible improvements to take it to the current state\
    \ of the art. In addition, it explores briefly the potential of combining different\
    \ types of embeddings as input features; it also discusses possible ways for generating\
    \ \u201Cartificial corpora\u201D from knowledge bases \u2013 for the purpose of\
    \ producing training data and in relation to possible applications of embedding\
    \ lemmas and word senses in the same space."

  abstract: A multi-document summarizer finds the key topics from multiple textual
    sources and organizes information around them. In this paper we propose a summarization
    method for Persian text using paragraph vectors that can represent textual units
    of arbitrary lengths. We use these vectors to calculate the semantic relatedness
    between documents, cluster them to a number of predetermined groups, weight them
    based on their distance to the centroids and the intra-cluster homogeneity and
    take out the key paragraphs. We compare the final summaries with the gold-standard
    summaries of 21 digital topics using the ROUGE evaluation metric. Experimental
    results show the advantages of using paragraph vectors over earlier attempts at
    developing similar methods for a low resource language like Persian.

    \ sentence in two dimensions - sentiment and arousal. For this purpose two techniques\
    \ will be com-bined \u2013 Machine Learning approach and Lexicon-based approach.\
    \ The first di-mension will give the sentiment value \u2013 positive versus negative.\
    \ This will be re-solved by using Na\xEFve Bayes Classifier. The second and more\
    \ interesting dimen-sion will determine the level of arousal. This will be achieved\
    \ by evaluation of given a phrase or sentence based on lexi-con with affective\
    \ ratings for 14 thousand English words."

  abstract: "The paper aims to achieve the legal question answering information retrieval\
    \ (IR) task at Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE)\
    \ 2017. Our proposal methodology for the task is to utilize deep neural network,\
    \ natural language processing and word2vec. The system was evaluated using training\
    \ and testing data from the competition on legal information extraction/entailment\
    \ (COLIEE). Our system mainly focuses on giving relevant civil law articles for\
    \ given bar exams. The corpus of legal questions is drawn from Japanese Legal\
    \ Bar exam queries. We implemented a combined deep neural network with additional\
    \ features NLP and word2vec to gain the corresponding civil law articles based\
    \ on a given bar exam \u2018Yes/No\u2019 questions. This paper focuses on clustering\
    \ words-with-relation in order to acquire relevant civil law articles. All evaluation\
    \ processes were done on the COLIEE 2017 training and test data set. The experimental\
    \ result shows a very promising result."
