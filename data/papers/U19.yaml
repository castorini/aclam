  abstract: "Kunwinjku is an indigenous Australian language spoken in northern Australia\
    \ which exhibits agglutinative and polysynthetic properties. Members of the community\
    \ have expressed interest in co-developing language applications that promote\
    \ their values and priorities. Modeling the morphology of the Kunwinjku language\
    \ is an important step towards accomplishing the community\u2019s goals. Finite\
    \ State Transducers have long been the go-to method for modeling morphologically\
    \ rich languages, and in this paper we discuss some of the distinct modeling challenges\
    \ present in the morphosyntax of verbs in Kunwinjku. We show that a fairly straightforward\
    \ implementation using standard features of the foma toolkit can account for much\
    \ of the verb structure. Continuing challenges include robustness in the face\
    \ of variation and unseen vocabulary, as well as how to handle complex reduplicative\
    \ processes. Our future work will build off the baseline and challenges presented\
    \ here."

  abstract: 'In this paper, we adapt Deep-speare, a joint neural network model for
    English sonnets, to Chinese poetry. We illustrate characteristics of Chinese quatrain
    and explain our architecture as well as training and generation procedure, which
    differs from Shakespeare sonnets in several aspects. We analyse the generated
    poetry and find that model works well for Chinese poetry, as it can: (1) generate
    coherent 4-line quatrains of different topics; and (2) capture rhyme automatically
    (to a certain extent).'

  abstract: Optimal language acquisition via reading requires the learners to read
    slightly above their current language skill level. Identifying material at the
    right level is the essential role of automatic readability measurement. Short
    message platforms such as Twitter offer the opportunity for language practice
    while reading about current topics and engaging in conversation in small doses,
    and can be filtered according to linguistic criteria to suit the learner. In this
    research, we explore how readable tweets are for English language learners and
    which factors contribute to their readability. With participants from six language
    groups, we collected 14,659 data points, each representing a tweet from a pool
    of 4100 tweets, and a judgement of perceived readability. Traditional readability
    measures and features failed on the data-set, but demographic data showed that
    judgements were largely genuine and reflected reported language skill, which is
    consistent with other recent studies. We report on the properties of the data
    set and implications for future research.

  abstract: 'One of the most common metrics to automatically evaluate opinion summaries
    is ROUGE, a metric developed for text summarisation. ROUGE counts the overlap
    of word or word units between a candidate summary against reference summaries.
    This formulation treats all words in the reference summary equally.In opinion
    summaries, however, not all words in the reference are equally important. Opinion
    summarisation requires to correctly pair two types of semantic information: (1)
    aspect or opinion target; and (2) polarity of candidate and reference summaries.
    We investigate the suitability of ROUGE for evaluating opin-ion summaries of online
    reviews. Using three simulation-based experiments, we evaluate the behaviour of
    ROUGE for opinion summarisation on the ability to match aspect and polarity. We
    show that ROUGE cannot distinguish opinion summaries of similar or opposite polarities
    for the same aspect. Moreover,ROUGE scores have significant variance under different
    configuration settings. As a result, we present three recommendations for future
    work that uses ROUGE to evaluate opinion summarisation.'

  abstract: 'Despite the success of attention-based neural models for natural language
    generation and classification tasks, they are unable to capture the discourse
    structure of larger documents. We hypothesize that explicit discourse representations
    have utility for NLP tasks over longer documents or document sequences, which
    sequence-to-sequence models are unable to capture. For abstractive summarization,
    for instance, conventional neural models simply match source documents and the
    summary in a latent space without explicit representation of text structure or
    relations. In this paper, we propose to use neural discourse representations obtained
    from a rhetorical structure theory (RST) parser to enhance document representations.
    Specifically, document representations are generated for discourse spans, known
    as the elementary discourse units (EDUs). We empirically investigate the benefit
    of the proposed approach on two different tasks: abstractive summarization and
    popularity prediction of online petitions. We find that the proposed approach
    leads to substantial improvements in all cases.'

    \ fine-tuned on a second, and in doing so, suffers a \u201Ccatastrophic\u201D\
    \ drop in performance over the first task \u2014 is a hurdle in the development\

    \ primary finding is that CNNs forget less than LSTMs. We show that max-pooling\
    \ is the underlying operation which helps CNNs alleviate forgetting compared to\
    \ LSTMs. We also found that curriculum learning, placing a hard task towards the\
    \ end of task sequence, reduces forgetting. We analysed the effect of fine-tuning\

  abstract: Extracting chemical reactions from patents is a crucial task for chemists
    working on chemical exploration. In this paper we introduce the novel task of
    detecting the textual spans that describe or refer to chemical reactions within
    patents. We formulate this task as a paragraph-level sequence tagging problem,
    where the system is required to return a sequence of paragraphs which contain
    a description of a reaction. To address this new task, we construct an annotated
    dataset from an existing proprietary database of chemical reactions manually extracted
    from patents. We introduce several baseline methods for the task and evaluate
    them over our dataset. Through error analysis, we discuss what makes the task
    complex and challenging, and suggest possible directions for future research.

  abstract: Pain is the main symptom that patients present with to the emergency department
    (ED). Pain management, however, is often poorly done aspect of emergency care
    and patients with painful conditions can endure long waits before their pain is
    assessed or treated. To improve pain management quality, identifying whether or
    not an ED patient presents with pain is an important task and allows for further
    investigation of the quality of care provided. In this paper, machine learning
    was utilised to handle the task of automatically detecting patients who present
    at EDs with pain from retrospective data. Experimental results on a manually annotated
    dataset show that our proposed machine learning models achieve high performances,
    in which the highest accuracy and macro-averaged F1 are 91.00% and 90.96%, respectively.

  abstract: The first step towards designing an information system is conceptual modelling
    where domain experts and knowledge engineers identify the necessary information
    together to build an information system. Entity relationship modelling is one
    of the most popular conceptual modelling techniques that represents an information
    system in terms of entities, attributes and relationships. Entity relationship
    models are constructed graphically but are often difficult to understand by domain
    experts. To overcome this problem, we suggest to verbalise these models in a controlled
    natural language. In this paper, we present CNL-ER, a controlled natural language
    for specifying and verbalising entity relationship (ER) models that not only solves
    the verbalisation problem for these models but also provides the benefits of automatic
    verification and validation, and semantic round-tripping which makes the communication
    process transparent between the domain experts and the knowledge engineers.

  abstract: "Reading is important for any language learner, but the difficulty level\
    \ of the text needs to match a reader\u2019s level to enable efficient learning\
    \ of new vocabulary. Many widely used traditional readability measures are not\
    \ effective for those who speak English as a second or additional language. This\
    \ study examines English readability for Vietnamese native speakers (VL1). A collection\
    \ of text difficulty judgements of nearly 100 English text passages was obtained\
    \ from 12 VL1 participants, using a 5-point Likert scale. Using the same basic\
    \ features found in traditional English readability measures we found that SVMs\
    \ and Dale-Chall features were slightly better than linear models using either\
    \ Flesch or Dale-Chall. VL1 participants\u2019 text judgements were strongly correlated\
    \ with their past IELTS test scores. This study introduces a first approximation\
    \ to readability of English text for VL1, with suggestions for further improvements."

  abstract: 'Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has been an attractive approach to deal with
    limited labeled datasets or leverage related tasks, for a variety of NLP problems.
    We examine the benefit of MTL for three specific pairs of health informatics tasks
    that deal with: (a) overlapping symptoms for the same classification problem (personal
    health mention classification for influenza and for a set of symptoms); (b) overlapping
    medical concepts for related classification problems (vaccine usage and drug usage
    detection); and, (c) related classification problems (vaccination intent and vaccination
    relevance detection). We experiment with a simple neural architecture: a shared
    layer followed by task-specific dense layers. The novelty of this work is that
    it compares alternatives for shared layers for these pairs of tasks. While our
    observations agree with the promise of MTL as compared to single-task learning,
    for health informatics, we show that the benefit also comes with caveats in terms
    of the choice of shared layers and the relatedness between the participating tasks.'

  abstract: The coarse-to-fine (coarse2fine) methods have recently been widely used
    in the generation tasks. The methods first generate a rough sketch in the coarse
    stage and then use the sketch to get the final result in the fine stage. However,
    they usually lack the correction ability when getting a wrong sketch. To solve
    this problem, in this paper, we propose an improved coarse2fine model with a control
    mechanism, with which our method can control the influence of the sketch on the
    final results in the fine stage. Even if the sketch is wrong, our model still
    has the opportunity to get a correct result. We have experimented our model on
    the tasks of semantic parsing and math word problem solving. The results have
    shown the effectiveness of our proposed model.
