  abstract: "Analogy completion via vector arithmetic has become a common means of\
    \ demonstrating the compositionality of word embeddings. Previous work have shown\
    \ that this strategy works more reliably for certain types of analogical word\
    \ relationships than for others, but these studies have not offered a convincing\
    \ account for why this is the case. We arrive at such an account through an experiment\
    \ that targets a wide variety of analogy questions and defines a baseline condition\
    \ to more accurately measure the efficacy of our system. We find that the most\
    \ reliably solvable analogy categories involve either 1) the application of a\
    \ morpheme with clear syntactic effects, 2) male\u2013female alternations, or\
    \ 3) named entities. These broader types do not pattern cleanly along a syntactic\u2013\
    semantic divide. We suggest instead that their commonality is distributional,\
    \ in that the difference between the distributions of two words in any given pair\
    \ encompasses a relatively small number of word types. Our study offers a needed\
    \ explanation for why analogy tests succeed and fail where they do and provides\
    \ nuanced insight into the relationship between word distributions and the theoretical\
    \ linguistic domains of syntax and semantics."

  abstract: Recognizing and distinguishing antonyms from other types of semantic relations
    is an essential part of language understanding systems. In this paper, we present
    a novel method for deriving antonym pairs using paraphrase pairs containing negation
    markers. We further propose a neural network model, AntNET, that integrates morphological
    features indicative of antonymy into a path-based relation detection algorithm.
    We demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in distinguishing
    antonyms from other semantic relations and is capable of efficiently handling
    multi-word expressions.

  abstract: "Distributed representations of sentences have been developed recently\
    \ to represent their meaning as real-valued vectors. However, it is not clear\
    \ how much information such representations retain about the polarity of sentences.\
    \ To study this question, we decode sentiment from unsupervised sentence representations\
    \ learned with different architectures (sensitive to the order of words, the order\
    \ of sentences, or none) in 9 typologically diverse languages. Sentiment results\
    \ from the (recursive) composition of lexical items and grammatical strategies\
    \ such as negation and concession. The results are manifold: we show that there\
    \ is no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 representation architecture outperforming\
    \ the others across the board. Rather, the top-ranking architectures depend on\
    \ the language at hand. Moreover, we find that in several cases the additive composition\
    \ model based on skip-gram word vectors may surpass supervised state-of-art architectures\
    \ such as bi-directional LSTMs. Finally, we provide a possible explanation of\
    \ the observed variation based on the type of negative constructions in each language."

  abstract: We introduce WHiC, a challenging testbed for detecting hypernymy, an asymmetric
    relation between words. While previous work has focused on detecting hypernymy
    between word types, we ground the meaning of words in specific contexts drawn
    from WordNet examples, and require predictions to be sensitive to changes in contexts.
    WHiC lets us analyze complementary properties of two approaches of inducing vector
    representations of word meaning in context. We show that such contextualized word
    representations also improve detection of a wider range of semantic relations
    in context.

  abstract: "With the explosive growth of Internet, more and more domain-specific\
    \ environments appear, such as forums, blogs, MOOCs and etc. Domain-specific words\
    \ appear in these areas and always play a critical role in the domain-specific\
    \ NLP tasks. This paper aims at extracting Chinese domain-specific new words automatically.\
    \ The extraction of domain-specific new words has two parts including both new\
    \ words in this domain and the especially important words. In this work, we propose\
    \ a joint statistical model to perform these two works simultaneously. Compared\
    \ to traditional new words detection models, our model doesn\u2019t need handcraft\
    \ features which are labor intensive. Experimental results demonstrate that our\
    \ joint model achieves a better performance compared with the state-of-the-art\

  abstract: Multiword expressions (MWEs) are lexical items that can be decomposed
    into multiple component words, but have properties that are unpredictable with
    respect to their component words. In this paper we propose the first deep learning
    models for token-level identification of MWEs. Specifically, we consider a layered
    feedforward network, a recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural networks.
    In experimental results we show that convolutional neural networks are able to
    outperform the previous state-of-the-art for MWE identification, with a convolutional
    neural network with three hidden layers giving the best performance.

  abstract: We propose an online, end-to-end, neural generative conversational model
    for open-domain dialogue. It is trained using a unique combination of offline
    two-phase supervised learning and online human-in-the-loop active learning. While
    most existing research proposes offline supervision or hand-crafted reward functions
    for online reinforcement, we devise a novel interactive learning mechanism based
    on hamming-diverse beam search for response generation and one-character user-feedback
    at each step. Experiments show that our model inherently promotes the generation
    of semantically relevant and interesting responses, and can be used to train agents
    with customized personas, moods and conversational styles.

  abstract: "Word embeddings are supposed to provide easy access to semantic relations\
    \ such as \u201Cmale of\u201D (man\u2013woman). While this claim has been investigated\
    \ for concepts, little is known about the distributional behavior of relations\
    \ of (Named) Entities. We describe two word embedding-based models that predict\
    \ values for relational attributes of entities, and analyse them. The task is\
    \ challenging, with major performance differences between relations. Contrary\
    \ to many NLP tasks, high difficulty for a relation does not result from low frequency,\
    \ but from (a) one-to-many mappings; and (b) lack of context patterns expressing\
    \ the relation that are easy to pick up by word embeddings."

  abstract: Collecting spontaneous speech corpora that are open-ended, yet topically
    constrained, is increasingly popular for research in spoken dialogue systems and
    speaker state, inter alia. Typically, these corpora are labeled by human annotators,
    either in the lab or through crowd-sourcing; however, this is cumbersome and time-consuming
    for large corpora. We present four different approaches to automatically tagging
    a corpus when general topics of the conversations are known. We develop these
    approaches on the Columbia X-Cultural Deception corpus and find accuracy that
    significantly exceeds the baseline. Finally, we conduct a cross-corpus evaluation
    by testing the best performing approach on the Columbia/SRI/Colorado corpus.

  abstract: The Practical Lexical Function (PLF) model is a model of computational
    distributional semantics that attempts to strike a balance between expressivity
    and learnability in predicting phrase meaning and shows competitive results. We
    investigate how well the PLF carries over to free word order languages, given
    that it builds on observations of predicate-argument combinations that are harder
    to recover in free word order languages. We evaluate variants of the PLF for Croatian,
    using a new lexical substitution dataset. We find that the PLF works about as
    well for Croatian as for English, but demonstrate that its strength lies in modeling
    verbs, and that the free word order affects the less robust PLF variant.

  abstract: Word embeddings are now a standard technique for inducing meaning representations
    for words. For getting good representations, it is important to take into account
    different senses of a word. In this paper, we propose a mixture model for learning
    multi-sense word embeddings. Our model generalizes the previous works in that
    it allows to induce different weights of different senses of a word. The experimental
    results show that our model outperforms previous models on standard evaluation
    tasks.

  abstract: Script knowledge plays a central role in text understanding and is relevant
    for a variety of downstream tasks. In this paper, we consider two recent datasets
    which provide a rich and general representation of script events in terms of paraphrase
    sets. We introduce the task of mapping event mentions in narrative texts to such
    script event types, and present a model for this task that exploits rich linguistic
    representations as well as information on temporal ordering. The results of our
    experiments demonstrate that this complex task is indeed feasible.

  abstract: "This paper explores the possibilities of analogical reasoning with vector\
    \ space models. Given two pairs of words with the same relation (e.g. man:woman\
    \ :: king:queen), it was proposed that the offset between one pair of the corresponding\
    \ word vectors can be used to identify the unknown member of the other pair (king\
    \ - man + woman = queen). We argue against such \u201Clinguistic regularities\u201D\
    \ as a model for linguistic relations in vector space models and as a benchmark,\
    \ and we show that the vector offset (as well as two other, better-performing\
    \ methods) suffers from dependence on vector similarity."

  abstract: Frame-semantic parsing and semantic role labelling, that aim to automatically
    assign semantic roles to arguments of verbs in a sentence, have become an active
    strand of research in NLP. However, to date these methods have relied on a predefined
    inventory of semantic roles. In this paper, we present a method to automatically
    learn argument role inventories for verbs from large corpora of text, images and
    videos. We evaluate the method against manually constructed role inventories in
    FrameNet and show that the visual model outperforms the language-only model and
    operates with a high precision.

  abstract: "Semantic parsing shines at analyzing complex natural language that involves\
    \ composition and computation over multiple pieces of evidence. However, datasets\
    \ for semantic parsing contain many factoid questions that can be answered from\
    \ a single web document. In this paper, we propose to evaluate semantic parsing-based\
    \ question answering models by comparing them to a question answering baseline\
    \ that queries the web and extracts the answer only from web snippets, without\
    \ access to the target knowledge-base. We investigate this approach on COMPLEXQUESTIONS,\
    \ a dataset designed to focus on compositional language, and find that our model\
    \ obtains reasonable performance (\u223C35 F1 compared to 41 F1 of state-of-the-art).\
    \ We find in our analysis that our model performs well on complex questions involving\
    \ conjunctions, but struggles on questions that involve relation composition and\
    \ superlatives."

  abstract: In theoretical linguistics, logical metonymy is defined as the combination
    of an event-subcategorizing verb with an entity-denoting direct object (e.g.,
    The author began the book), so that the interpretation of the VP requires the
    retrieval of a covert event (e.g., writing). Psycholinguistic studies have revealed
    extra processing costs for logical metonymy, a phenomenon generally explained
    with the introduction of new semantic structure. In this paper, we present a general
    distributional model for sentence comprehension inspired by the Memory, Unification
    and Control model by Hagoort (2013,2016). We show that our distributional framework
    can account for the extra processing costs of logical metonymy and can identify
    the covert event in a classification task.

  abstract: "We consider the semantics of prepositions, revisiting a broad-coverage\
    \ annotation scheme used for annotating all 4,250 preposition tokens in a 55,000\
    \ word corpus of English. Attempts to apply the scheme to adpositions and case\
    \ markers in other languages, as well as some problematic cases in English, have\
    \ led us to reconsider the assumption that an adposition\u2019s lexical contribution\
    \ is equivalent to the role/relation that it mediates. Our proposal is to embrace\
    \ the potential for construal in adposition use, expressing such phenomena directly\
    \ at the token level to manage complexity and avoid sense proliferation. We suggest\
    \ a framework to represent both the scene role and the adposition\u2019s lexical\
    \ function so they can be annotated at scale\u2014supporting automatic, statistical\
    \ processing of domain-general language\u2014and discuss how this representation\

  abstract: "The topics of mass and count have been studied for many decades in philosophy\
    \ (e.g., Quine, 1960; Pelletier, 1975), linguistics (e.g., McCawley, 1975; Allen,\
    \ 1980; Krifka, 1991) and psychology (e.g., Middleton et al, 2004; Barner et al,\
    \ 2009). More recently, interest from within computational linguistics has studied\
    \ the issues involved (e.g., Pustejovsky, 1991; Bond, 2005; Schmidtke & Kuperman,\
    \ 2016), to name just a few. As is pointed out in these works, there are many\
    \ difficult conceptual issues involved in the study of this contrast. In this\
    \ article we study one of these issues \u2013 the \u201CDual-Life\u201D of being\

  abstract: Recently, several datasets have become available which represent natural
    language phenomena as graphs. Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRL) have been
    the focus of much attention as a formalism to represent the graphs in these datasets.
    Chiang et al. (2013) prove that HRL graphs can be parsed in polynomial time with
    respect to the size of the input graph. We believe that HRL are more expressive
    than is necessary to represent semantic graphs and we propose the use of Regular
    Graph Languages (RGL; Courcelle 1991), which is a subfamily of HRL, as a possible
    alternative. We provide a top-down parsing algorithm for RGL that runs in time
    linear in the size of the input graph.

  abstract: Creating annotated frame lexicons such as PropBank and FrameNet is expensive
    and labor intensive. We present a method to induce an embedded frame lexicon in
    an minimally supervised fashion using nothing more than unlabeled predicate-argument
    word pairs. We hypothesize that aggregating such pair selectional preferences
    across training leads us to a global understanding that captures predicate-argument
    frame structure. Our approach revolves around a novel integration between a predictive
    embedding model and an Indian Buffet Process posterior regularizer. We show, through
    our experimental evaluation, that we outperform baselines on two tasks and can
    learn an embedded frame lexicon that is able to capture some interesting generalities
    in relation to hand-crafted semantic frames.

  abstract: Relation extraction is the task of recognizing and extracting relations
    between entities or concepts in texts. A common approach is to exploit existing
    knowledge to learn linguistic patterns expressing the target relation and use
    these patterns for extracting new relation mentions. Deriving relation patterns
    automatically usually results in large numbers of candidates, which need to be
    filtered to derive a subset of patterns that reliably extract correct relation
    mentions. We address the pattern selection task by exploiting the knowledge represented
    by entailment graphs, which capture semantic relationships holding among the learned
    pattern candidates. This is motivated by the fact that a pattern may not express
    the target relation explicitly, but still be useful for extracting instances for
    which the relation holds, because its meaning entails the meaning of the target
    relation. We evaluate the usage of both automatically generated and gold-standard
    entailment graphs in a relation extraction scenario and present favorable experimental
    results, exhibiting the benefits of structuring and selecting patterns based on
    entailment graphs.

  abstract: Detecting aspectual properties of clauses in the form of situation entity
    types has been shown to depend on a combination of syntactic-semantic and contextual
    features. We explore this task in a deep-learning framework, where tuned word
    representations capture lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We introduce
    an attention mechanism that pinpoints relevant context not only for the current
    instance, but also for the larger context. Apart from implicitly capturing task
    relevant features, the advantage of our neural model is that it avoids the need
    to reproduce linguistic features for other languages and is thus more easily transferable.
    We present experiments for English and German that achieve competitive performance.
    We present a novel take on modeling and exploiting genre information and showcase
    the adaptation of our system from one language to another.

  abstract: Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling and difficult to treat of all
    human medical/health conditions, ranking in the top ten causes of disability worldwide.
    It has been a puzzle in part due to difficulty in identifying its basic, fundamental
    components. Several studies have shown that some manifestations of schizophrenia
    (e.g., the negative symptoms that include blunting of speech prosody, as well
    as the disorganization symptoms that lead to disordered language) can be understood
    from the perspective of linguistics. However, schizophrenia research has not kept
    pace with technologies in computational linguistics, especially in semantics and
    pragmatics. As such, we examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing
    their syntax, semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self
    proclaimed) schizophrenia patients who publicly discuss their diagnoses. For writing
    samples dataset, syntactic features are found to be the most successful in classification
    whereas for the less structured Twitter dataset, a combination of features performed
    the best.

  abstract: Humans as well as animals are good at imitation. Inspired by this, the
    learning by demonstration view of machine learning learns to perform a task from
    detailed example demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce the task of question
    answering using natural language demonstrations where the question answering system
    is provided with detailed demonstrative solutions to questions in natural language.
    As a case study, we explore the task of learning to solve geometry problems using
    demonstrative solutions available in textbooks. We collect a new dataset of demonstrative
    geometry solutions from textbooks and explore approaches that learn to interpret
    these demonstrations as well as to use these interpretations to solve geometry
    problems. Our approaches show improvements over the best previously published
    system for solving geometry problems.

  abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the meaning similarity of sentences.
    Applications include machine translation (MT), summarization, generation, question
    answering (QA), short answer grading, semantic search, dialog and conversational
    systems. The STS shared task is a venue for assessing the current state-of-the-art.
    The 2017 task focuses on multilingual and cross-lingual pairs with one sub-track
    exploring MT quality estimation (MTQE) data. The task obtained strong participation
    from 31 teams, with 17 participating in all language tracks. We summarize performance
    and review a selection of well performing methods. Analysis highlights common
    errors, providing insight into the limitations of existing models. To support
    ongoing work on semantic representations, the STS Benchmark is introduced as a
    new shared training and evaluation set carefully selected from the corpus of English
    STS shared task data (2012-2017).

    paper introduces a new task on Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity
    which measures the semantic similarity of word pairs within and across five languages:
    English, Farsi, German, Italian and Spanish. High quality datasets were manually
    curated for the five languages with high inter-annotator agreements (consistently
    in the 0.9 ballpark). These were used for semi-automatic construction of ten cross-lingual
    datasets. 17 teams participated in the task, submitting 24 systems in subtask
    1 and 14 systems in subtask 2. Results show that systems that combine statistical
    knowledge from text corpora, in the form of word embeddings, and external knowledge
    from lexical resources are best performers in both subtasks. More information

    Comment Similarity, (B) Question\u2013Question Similarity, (C) Question\u2013\
    External Comment Similarity, and (D) Rerank the correct answers for a new question\
    \ in Arabic, providing all the data from 2015 and 2016 for training, and fresh\
    \ data for testing. Additionally, we added a new subtask E in order to enable\
    \ experimentation with Multi-domain Question Duplicate Detection in a larger-scale\
    \ scenario, using StackExchange subforums. A total of 23 teams participated in\
    \ the task, and submitted a total of 85 runs (36 primary and 49 contrastive) for\
    \ subtasks A\u2013D. Unfortunately, no teams participated in subtask E. A variety\
    \ of approaches and features were used by the participating systems to address\
    \ the different subtasks. The best systems achieved an official score (MAP) of\
    \ 88.43, 47.22, 15.46, and 61.16 in subtasks A, B, C, and D, respectively. These\
    \ scores are better than the baselines, especially for subtasks A\u2013C."

  abstract: "This paper describes a new shared task for humor understanding that attempts\

    \ in response to shared hashtags, collected from the \u2018Hashtag Wars\u2019\
    \ segment of the TV show @midnight. The results are evaluated in two subtasks\
    \ that require the participants to generate either the correct pairwise comparisons\
    \ of tweets (subtask A), or the correct ranking of the tweets (subtask B) in terms\
    \ of how funny they are. 7 teams participated in subtask A, and 5 teams participated\
    \ in subtask B. The best accuracy in subtask A was 0.675. The best (lowest) rank\

  abstract: "A pun is a form of wordplay in which a word suggests two or more meanings\
    \ by exploiting polysemy, homonymy, or phonological similarity to another word,\
    \ for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. Though a recurrent and expected\
    \ feature in many discourse types, puns stymie traditional approaches to computational\
    \ lexical semantics because they violate their one-sense-per-context assumption.\
    \ This paper describes the first competitive evaluation for the automatic detection,\
    \ location, and interpretation of puns. We describe the motivation for these tasks,\
    \ the evaluation methods, and the manually annotated data set. Finally, we present\
    \ an overview and discussion of the participating systems\u2019 methodologies,\
    \ resources, and results."

  abstract: This paper presents three systems for semantic textual similarity (STS)
    evaluation at SemEval-2017 STS task. One is an unsupervised system and the other
    two are supervised systems which simply employ the unsupervised one. All our systems
    mainly depend on the (SIS), which is constructed based on the semantic hierarchical
    taxonomy in WordNet, to compute non-overlapping information content (IC) of sentences.
    Our team ranked 2nd among 31 participating teams by the primary score of Pearson
    correlation coefficient (PCC) mean of 7 tracks and achieved the best performance
    on Track 1 (AR-AR) dataset.

  abstract: In this paper we present the system for Answer Selection and Ranking in
    Community Question Answering, which we build as part of our participation in SemEval-2017
    Task 3. We develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based system that makes use
    of textual, domain-specific, word-embedding and topic-modeling features. In addition,
    we propose a novel method for dialogue chain identification in comment threads.
    Our primary submission won subtask C, outperforming other systems in all the primary
    evaluation metrics. We performed well in other English subtasks, ranking third
    in subtask A and eighth in subtask B. We also developed open source toolkits for
    all the three English subtasks by the name cQARank [https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank].

    Learning a Sense of Humor. Humor detection has up until now been predominantly
    addressed using feature-based approaches. Our system utilizes recurrent deep learning
    methods with dense embeddings to predict humorous tweets from the @midnight show
    #HashtagWars. In order to include both meaning and sound in the analysis, GloVe
    embeddings are combined with a novel phonetic representation to serve as input
    to an LSTM component. The output is combined with a character-based CNN model,
    and an XGBoost component in an ensemble model which achieves 0.675 accuracy on
    the evaluation data.'

  abstract: We present our submitted systems for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)
    Track 4 at SemEval-2017. Given a pair of Spanish-English sentences, each system
    must estimate their semantic similarity by a score between 0 and 5. In our submission,
    we use syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based, and MT-based methods. We
    also combine these methods in unsupervised and supervised way. Our best run ranked
    1st on track 4a with a correlation of 83.02% with human annotations.

  abstract: This paper describes the model UdL we proposed to solve the semantic textual
    similarity task of SemEval 2017 workshop. The track we participated in was estimating
    the semantics relatedness of a given set of sentence pairs in English. The best
    run out of three submitted runs of our model achieved a Pearson correlation score
    of 0.8004 compared to a hidden human annotation of 250 pairs. We used random forest
    ensemble learning to map an expandable set of extracted pairwise features into
    a semantic similarity estimated value bounded between 0 and 5. Most of these features
    were calculated using word embedding vectors similarity to align Part of Speech
    (PoS) and Name Entities (NE) tagged tokens of each sentence pair. Among other
    pairwise features, we experimented a classical tf-idf weighted Bag of Words (BoW)
    vector model but with character-based range of n-grams instead of words. This
    sentence vector BoW-based feature gave a relatively high importance value percentage
    in the feature importances analysis of the ensemble learning.

    Semantic Textual Similarity task (Task1) for monolingual and cross-lingual sentence
    pairs. A sense-based language independent textual similarity approach is presented,
    in which a proposed alignment similarity method coupled with new usage of a semantic
    network (BabelNet) is used. Additionally, a previously proposed integration between
    sense-based and sur-face-based semantic textual similarity approach is applied
    together with our proposed approach. For all the tracks in Task1, Run1 is a string
    kernel with alignments metric and Run2 is a sense-based alignment similarity method.
    The first run is ranked 10th, and the second is ranked 12th in the primary track,
    with correlation 0.619 and 0.617 respectively

  abstract: This paper describes our convolutional neural network (CNN) system for
    Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task. We calculated semantic similarity score
    between two sentences by comparing their semantic vectors. We generated semantic
    vector of every sentence by max pooling every dimension of their word vectors.
    There are mainly two trick points in our system. One is that we trained a CNN
    to transfer GloVe word vectors to a more proper form for STS task before pooling.
    Another is that we trained a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) to transfer
    difference of two semantic vectors to probability of every similarity score. We
    decided all hyper parameters empirically. In spite of the simplicity of our neural
    network system, we achieved a good accuracy and ranked 3rd in primary track of
    SemEval 2017.

  abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) evaluation assesses the degree to which
    two parts of texts are similar, based on their semantic evaluation. In this paper,
    we describe three models submitted to STS SemEval 2017. Given two English parts
    of a text, each of proposed methods outputs the assessment of their semantic similarity.
    We propose an approach for computing monolingual semantic textual similarity based
    on an ensemble of three distinct methods. Our model consists of recursive neural
    network (RNN) text auto-encoders ensemble with supervised a model of vectorized
    sentences using reduced part of speech (PoS) weighted word embeddings as well
    as unsupervised a method based on word coverage (TakeLab). Additionally, we enrich
    our model with additional features that allow disambiguation of ensemble methods
    based on their efficiency. We have used Multi-Layer Perceptron as an ensemble
    classifier basing on estimations of trained Gradient Boosting Regressors. Results
    of our research proves that using such ensemble leads to a higher accuracy due
    to a fact that each member-algorithm tends to specialize in particular type of
    sentences. Simple model based on PoS weighted Word2Vec word embeddings seem to
    improve performance of more complex RNN based auto-encoders in the ensemble. In
    the monolingual English-English STS subtask our Ensemble based model achieved
    mean Pearson correlation of .785 compared with human annotators.

  abstract: This paper reports the details of our submissions in the task 1 of SemEval
    2017. This task aims at assessing the semantic textual similarity of two sentences
    or texts. We submit three unsupervised systems based on word embeddings. The differences
    between these runs are the various preprocessing on evaluation data. The best
    performance of these systems on the evaluation of Pearson correlation is 0.6887.
    Unsurprisingly, results of our runs demonstrate that data preprocessing, such
    as tokenization, lemmatization, extraction of content words and removing stop
    words, is helpful and plays a significant role in improving the performance of
    models.

  abstract: Shared Task 1 at SemEval-2017 deals with assessing the semantic similarity
    between sentences, either in the same or in different languages. In our system
    submission, we employ multilingual word representations, in which similar words
    in different languages are close to one another. Using such representations is
    advantageous, since the increasing amount of available parallel data allows for
    the application of such methods to many of the languages in the world. Hence,
    semantic similarity can be inferred even for languages for which no annotated
    data exists. Our system is trained and evaluated on all language pairs included
    in the shared task (English, Spanish, Arabic, and Turkish). Although development
    results are promising, our system does not yield high performance on the shared
    task test sets.

  abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) devotes to measuring the degree of equivalence
    in the underlying semantic of the sentence pair. We proposed a new system, ITNLP-AiKF,
    which applies in the SemEval 2017 Task1 Semantic Textual Similarity track 5 English
    monolingual pairs. In our system, rich features are involved, including Ontology
    based, word embedding based, Corpus based, Alignment based and Literal based feature.
    We leveraged the features to predict sentence pair similarity by a Support Vector
    Regression (SVR) model. In the result, a Pearson Correlation of 0.8231 is achieved
    by our system, which is a competitive result in the contest of this track.

  abstract: This paper describes our unsupervised knowledge-free approach to the SemEval-2017
    Task 1 Competition. The proposed method makes use of Paragraph Vector for assessing
    the semantic similarity between pairs of sentences. We experimented with various
    dimensions of the vector and three state-of-the-art similarity metrics. Given
    a cross-lingual task, we trained models corresponding to its two languages and
    combined the models by averaging the similarity scores. The results of our submitted
    runs are above the median scores for five out of seven test sets by means of Pearson
    Correlation. Moreover, one of our system runs performed best on the Spanish-English-WMT
    test set ranking first out of 53 runs submitted in total by all participants.

    features with lexical similarity measures using regression methods. We also present
    a way on ensembling both models. Out of 84 submitted runs, our team best multi-lingual

  abstract: We describe a modified shared-LSTM network for the Semantic Textual Similarity
    (STS) task at SemEval-2017. The network builds on previously explored Siamese
    network architectures. We treat max sentence length as an additional hyperparameter
    to be tuned (beyond learning rate, regularization, and dropout). Our results demonstrate
    that hand-tuning max sentence training length significantly improves final accuracy.
    After optimizing hyperparameters, we train the network on the multilingual semantic
    similarity task using pre-translated sentences. We achieved a correlation of 0.4792
    for all the subtasks. We achieved the fourth highest team correlation for Task
    4b, which was our best relative placement.

    model for predicting STS scores. The two subsystems are designed to learn Paraphrase
    and Event Embeddings that can take the consideration of paraphrasing characteristics

    system acquires 0.8 of Pearson Correlation Scores in this task.'

  abstract: In this paper we report our attempt to use, on the one hand, state-of-the-art
    neural approaches that are proposed to measure Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
    On the other hand, we propose an unsupervised cross-word alignment approach, which
    is linguistically motivated. The neural approaches proposed herein are divided
    into two main stages. The first stage deals with constructing neural word embeddings,
    the components of sentence embeddings. The second stage deals with constructing
    a semantic similarity function relating pairs of sentence embeddings. Unfortunately
    our competition results were poor in all tracks, therefore we concentrated our
    research to improve them for Track 5 (EN-EN).

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce an approach to combining word embeddings and
    machine translation for multilingual semantic word similarity, the task2 of SemEval-2017.
    Thanks to the unsupervised transliteration model, our cross-lingual word embeddings
    encounter decreased sums of OOVs. Our results are produced using only monolingual
    Wikipedia corpora and a limited amount of sentence-aligned data. Although relatively
    little resources are utilized, our system ranked 3rd in the monolingual subtask
    and can be the 6th in the cross-lingual subtask.

  abstract: This article describes the distributional strategy submitted by the Citius
    team to the SemEval 2017 Task 2. Even though the team participated in two subtasks,
    namely monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, the article is mainly focused
    on the cross-lingual subtask. Our method uses comparable corpora and syntactic
    dependencies to extract count-based and transparent bilingual distributional contexts.
    The evaluation of the results show that our method is competitive with other cross-lingual
    strategies, even those using aligned and parallel texts.

  abstract: We have built a simple corpus-based system to estimate words similarity
    in multiple languages with a count-based approach. After training on Wikipedia
    corpora, our system was evaluated on the multilingual subtask of SemEval-2017
    Task 2 and achieved a good level of performance, despite its great simplicity.
    Our results tend to demonstrate the power of the distributional approach in semantic
    similarity tasks, even without knowledge of the underlying language. We also show
    that dimensionality reduction has a considerable impact on the results.

  abstract: This paper shows the details of our system submissions in the task 2 of
    SemEval 2017. We take part in the subtask 1 of this task, which is an English
    monolingual subtask. This task is designed to evaluate the semantic word similarity
    of two linguistic items. The results of runs are assessed by standard Pearson
    and Spearman correlation, contrast with official gold standard set. The best performance
    of our runs is 0.781 (Final). The techniques of our runs mainly make use of the
    word embeddings and the knowledge-based method. The results demonstrate that the
    combined method is effective for the computation of word similarity, while the
    word embeddings and the knowledge-based technique, respectively, needs more deeply
    improvement in details.

    a simple, cognitively inspired, heuristics; it builds on a linguistic resource,
    the TTCS-e, that relies on BabelNet, NASARI and ConceptNet. The linguistic resource
    in fact contains a novel mixture of common-sense and encyclopedic knowledge. The
    obtained results point out that there is ample room for improvement, so that they
    are used to elaborate on present limitations and on future steps.

    similarity task. We use a combination of knowledge-based and corpus-based techniques.
    We use FarsNet, the Persian Word Net, besides deep learning techniques to extract
    the similarity of words. We evaluated our proposed approach on Persian (Farsi)
    test data at SemEval-2017. It outperformed the other participants and ranked the
    first in the challenge.

  abstract: This paper describes Sew-Embed, our language-independent approach to multilingual
    and cross-lingual semantic word similarity as part of the SemEval-2017 Task 2.
    We leverage the Wikipedia-based concept representations developed by Raganato
    et al. (2016), and propose an embedded augmentation of their explicit high-dimensional
    vectors, which we obtain by plugging in an arbitrary word (or sense) embedding
    representation, and computing a weighted average in the continuous vector space.
    We evaluate Sew-Embed with two different off-the-shelf embedding representations,
    and report their performances across all monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks
    available for the task. Despite its simplicity, especially compared with supervised
    or overly tuned approaches, Sew-Embed achieves competitive results in the cross-lingual
    setting (3rd best result in the global ranking of subtask 2, score 0.56).

  abstract: This paper presents the system in SemEval-2017 Task 3, Community Question
    Answering (CQA). We develop a ranking system that is capable of capturing semantic
    relations between text pairs with little word overlap. In addition to traditional
    NLP features, we introduce several neural network based matching features which
    enable our system to measure text similarity beyond lexicons. Our system significantly
    outperforms baseline methods and holds the second place in Subtask A and the fifth
    place in Subtask B, which demonstrates its efficacy on answer selection and question
    retrieval.

    parser in combination with word embeddings, the model creates sequences of inputs
    for a Recurrent Neural Network, which are then used for the ranking purposes of
    the Task. The score obtained on the official test data shows promising results.

    2017 task 3 community question answer, subtask B. The objective is to rerank questions
    obtained in web forum as per their similarity to original question. Our system
    uses pairwise learning to rank methods on rich set of hand designed and representation
    learning features. We use various semantic features that help our system to achieve
    promising results on the task. The system achieved second highest results on official
    metrics MAP and good results on other search metrics.

  abstract: This paper describes the SimBow system submitted at SemEval2017-Task3,
    for the question-question similarity subtask B. The proposed approach is a supervised
    combination of different unsupervised textual similarities. These textual similarities
    rely on the introduction of a relation matrix in the classical cosine similarity
    between bag-of-words, so as to get a soft-cosine that takes into account relations
    between words. According to the type of relation matrix embedded in the soft-cosine,
    semantic or lexical relations can be considered. Our system ranked first among
    the official submissions of subtask B.

  abstract: We describes deep neural networks frameworks in this paper to address
    the community question answering (cQA) ranking task (SemEval-2017 task 3). Convolutional
    neural networks and bi-directional long-short term memory networks are applied
    in our methods to extract semantic information from questions and answers (comments).
    In addition, in order to take the full advantage of question-comment semantic
    relevance, we deploy interaction layer and augmented features before calculating
    the similarity. The results show that our methods have the great effectiveness
    for both subtask A and subtask C.

    Question Answering (cQA). The Question Similarity subtask (B) aims to rank a set
    of related questions retrieved by a search engine according to their similarity
    to the original question. We adapted our feature-based system for Recognizing
    Question Entailment (RQE) to the question similarity task. Tested on cQA-B-2016
    test data, our RQE system outperformed the best system of the 2016 challenge in
    all measures with 77.47 MAP and 80.57 Accuracy. On cQA-B-2017 test data, performances
    of all systems dropped by around 30 points. Our primary system obtained 44.62
    MAP, 67.27 Accuracy and 47.25 F1 score. The cQA-B-2017 best system achieved 47.22
    MAP and 42.37 F1 score. Our system is ranked sixth in terms of MAP and third in
    terms of F1 out of 13 participating teams.

  abstract: In this paper we describe our QU-BIGIR system for the Arabic subtask D
    of the SemEval 2017 Task 3. Our approach builds on our participation in the past
    version of the same subtask. This year, our system uses different similarity measures
    that encodes lexical and semantic pairwise similarity of text pairs. In addition
    to well known similarity measures such as cosine similarity, we use other measures
    based on the summary statistics of word embedding representation for a given text.
    To rank a list of candidate question answer pairs for a given question, we learn
    a linear SVM classifier over our similarity features. Our best resulting run came
    second in subtask D with a very competitive performance to the first-ranking system.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the systems we submitted to the task 3 (Community
    Question Answering) in SemEval 2017 which contains three subtasks on English corpora,
    i.e., subtask A: Question-Comment Similarity, subtask B: Question-Question Similarity,
    and subtask C: Question-External Comment Similarity. For subtask A, we combined
    two different methods to represent question-comment pair, i.e., supervised model
    using traditional features and Convolutional Neural Network. For subtask B, we
    utilized the information of snippets returned from Search Engine with question
    subject as query. For subtask C, we ranked the comments by multiplying the probability
    of the pair related question comment being Good by the reciprocal rank of the
    related question.'

  abstract: The majority of core techniques to solve many problems in Community Question
    Answering (CQA) task rely on similarity computation. This work focuses on similarity
    between two sentences (or questions in subtask B) based on word embeddings. We
    exploit words importance levels in sentences or questions for similarity features,
    for classification and ranking with machine learning. Using only 2 types of similarity
    metric, our proposed method has shown comparable results with other complex systems.
    This method on subtask B 2017 dataset is ranked on position 7 out of 13 participants.
    Evaluation on 2016 dataset is on position 8 of 12, outperforms some complex systems.
    Further, this finding is explorable and potential to be used as baseline and extensible
    for many tasks in CQA and other textual similarity based system.

  abstract: This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2017 shared task of determining
    question-question similarity in a community question-answering setting (Task 3B).
    We extracted both syntactic and semantic similarity features between candidate
    questions, performed pairwise-preference learning to optimize for ranking order,
    and then trained a random forest classifier to predict whether the candidate questions
    are paraphrases of each other. This approach achieved a MAP of 45.7% out of max
    achievable 67.0% on the test set.

  abstract: This paper explores the role of semantic relatedness features, such as
    word associations, in humour recognition. Specifically, we examine the task of
    inferring pairwise humour judgments in Twitter hashtag wars. We examine a variety
    of word association features derived from University of Southern Florida Free
    Association Norms (USF) and the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (EAT) and find
    that word association-based features outperform Word2Vec similarity, a popular
    semantic relatedness measure. Our system achieves an accuracy of 56.42% using
    a combination of unigram perplexity, bigram perplexity, EAT difference (tweet-avg),
    USF forward (max), EAT difference (word-avg), USF difference (word-avg), EAT forward
    (min), USF difference (tweet-max), and EAT backward (min).

  abstract: The paper presents a system for locating a pun word. The developed method
    calculates a score for each word in a pun, using a number of components, including
    its Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information
    (NPMI) with other words in the pun text, its position in the text, part-of-speech
    and some syntactic features. The method achieved the best performance in the Heterographic
    category and the second best in the Homographic. Further analysis showed that
    IDF is the most useful characteristic, whereas the count of words with which the
    given word has high NPMI has a negative effect on performance.

    and Interpretation of English Puns consisting of three subtasks; pun detection,
    pun location, and pun interpretation, respectively. The system stands on recognizing
    a distinctive word which has a high association with the pun in the given sentence.
    The intended humorous meaning of pun is identified through the use of this word.
    Our official results confirm the potential of this approach.

  abstract: This paper describes our system participating in the SemEval-2017 Task
    7, for the subtasks of homographic pun location and homographic pun interpretation.
    For pun interpretation, we use a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
    method based on sense embeddings. Pun-based jokes can be divided into two parts,
    each containing information about the two distinct senses of the pun. To exploit
    this structure we split the context that is input to the WSD system into two local
    contexts and find the best sense for each of them. We use the output of pun interpretation
    for pun location. As we expect the two meanings of a pun to be very dissimilar,
    we compute sense embedding cosine distances for each sense-pair and select the
    word that has the highest distance. We describe experiments on different methods
    of splitting the context and compare our method to several baselines. We find
    evidence supporting our hypotheses and obtain competitive results for pun interpretation.

    potential rumours. The proposed approach makes use of topic independent features

  abstract: This paper describes our approach for SemEval-2017 Task 8. We aim at detecting
    the stance of tweets and determining the veracity of the given rumor. We utilize
    a convolutional neural network for short text categorization using multiple filter
    sizes. Our approach beats the baseline classifiers on different event data with
    good F1 scores. The best of our submitted runs achieves rank 1st among all scores
    on subtask B.

  abstract: This paper describes our submissions to task 8 in SemEval 2017, i.e.,
    Determining rumour veracity and support for rumours. Given a rumoured tweet and
    a lot of reply tweets, the subtask A is to label whether these tweets are support,
    deny, query or comment, and the subtask B aims to predict the veracity (i.e.,
    true, false, and unverified) with a confidence (in range of 0-1) of the given
    rumoured tweet. For both subtasks, we adopted supervised machine learning methods,
    incorporating rich features. Since training data is imbalanced, we specifically
    designed a two-step classifier to address subtask A .

  abstract: We describe the SemEval task of extracting keyphrases and relations between
    them from scientific documents, which is crucial for understanding which publications
    describe which processes, tasks and materials. Although this was a new task, we
    had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We expect the task
    and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for researchers working
    on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader knowledge base population
    and information extraction communities.

  abstract: 'Clinical TempEval 2017 aimed to answer the question: how well do systems
    trained on annotated timelines for one medical condition (colon cancer) perform
    in predicting timelines on another medical condition (brain cancer)? Nine sub-tasks
    were included, covering problems in time expression identification, event expression
    identification and temporal relation identification. Participant systems were
    evaluated on clinical and pathology notes from Mayo Clinic cancer patients, annotated
    with an extension of TimeML for the clinical domain. 11 teams participated in
    the tasks, with the best systems achieving F1 scores above 0.55 for time expressions,
    above 0.70 for event expressions, and above 0.40 for temporal relations. Most
    tasks observed about a 20 point drop over Clinical TempEval 2016, where systems
    were trained and evaluated on the same domain (colon cancer).'

  abstract: In this paper we describe our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art
    Twitter sentiment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. Our system leverages a large amount of unlabeled
    data to pre-train word embeddings. We then use a subset of the unlabeled data
    to fine tune the embeddings using distant supervision. The final CNNs and LSTMs
    are trained on the SemEval-2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are fined
    tuned again. To boost performances we ensemble several CNNs and LSTMs together.
    Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks amongst 40
    teams.

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in Task 5 track 2 of SemEval 2017
    to predict the sentiment of financial news headlines for a specific company on
    a continuous scale between -1 and 1. We tackled the problem using a number of
    approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional Long
    Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). We found an improvement of 4-6% using the LSTM model
    over the SVR and came fourth in the track. We report a number of different evaluations
    using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect on the effects of using
    different evaluation metrics.

  abstract: This paper describes the submission by the University of Sheffield to
    the SemEval 2017 Abstract Meaning Representation Parsing and Generation task (SemEval
    2017 Task 9, Subtask 2). We cast language generation from AMR as a sequence of
    actions (e.g., insert/remove/rename edges and nodes) that progressively transform
    the AMR graph into a dependency parse tree. This transition-based approach relies
    on the fact that an AMR graph can be considered structurally similar to a dependency
    tree, with a focus on content rather than function words. An added benefit to
    this approach is the greater amount of data we can take advantage of to train
    the parse-to-text linearizer. Our submitted run on the test data achieved a BLEU
    score of 3.32 and a Trueskill score of -22.04 on automatic and human evaluation
    respectively.

    2017 Task 10) on entity and relation extraction from scientific papers. Our model
    is based on the end-to-end relation extraction model of Miwa and Bansal (2016)
    with several enhancements such as semi-supervised learning via neural language
    models, character-level encoding, gazetteers extracted from existing knowledge
    bases, and model ensembles. Our official submission ranked first in end-to-end
    entity and relation extraction (scenario 1), and second in the relation-only extraction
    (scenario 3).

  abstract: "While sentiment analysis in English has achieved significant progress,\
    \ it remains a challenging task in Arabic given the rich morphology of the language.\
    \ It becomes more challenging when applied to Twitter data that comes with additional\
    \ sources of noise including dialects, misspellings, grammatical mistakes, code\
    \ switching and the use of non-textual objects to express sentiments. This paper\
    \ describes the \u201COMAM\u201D systems that we developed as part of SemEval-2017\
    \ task 4. We evaluate English state-of-the-art methods on Arabic tweets for subtask\
    \ A. As for the remaining subtasks, we introduce a topic-based approach that accounts\
    \ for topic specificities by predicting topics or domains of upcoming tweets,\
    \ and then using this information to predict their sentiment. Results indicate\
    \ that applying the English state-of-the-art method to Arabic has achieved solid\
    \ results without significant enhancements. Furthermore, the topic-based method\
    \ ranked 1st in subtasks C and E, and 2nd in subtask D."

  abstract: This paper describes our multi-view ensemble approach to SemEval-2017
    Task 4 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, specifically, the Message Polarity Classification
    subtask for English (subtask A). Our system is a voting ensemble, where each base
    classifier is trained in a different feature space. The first space is a bag-of-words
    model and has a Linear SVM as base classifier. The second and third spaces are

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our system implementation for sentiment analysis
    in Twitter. This system combines two models based on deep neural networks, namely
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent
    neural network, through interpolation. Distributed representation of words as
    vectors are input to the system, and the output is a sentiment class. The neural
    network models are trained exclusively with the data sets provided by the organizers
    of SemEval-2017 Task 4 Subtask A. Overall, this system has achieved 0.618 for
    the average recall rate, 0.587 for the average F1 score, and 0.618 for accuracy.

  abstract: Recently, neural twitter sentiment classification has become one of state-of-thearts,
    which relies less feature engineering work compared with traditional methods.
    In this paper, we propose a simple and effective ensemble method to further boost
    the performances of neural models. We collect several word embedding sets which
    are publicly released (often are learned on different corpus) or constructed by
    running Skip-gram on released large-scale corpus. We make an assumption that different
    word embeddings cover different words and encode different semantic knowledge,
    thus using them together can improve the generalizations and performances of neural
    models. In the SemEval 2017, our method ranks 1st in Accuracy, 5th in AverageR.
    Meanwhile, the additional comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our model
    over these ones based on only one word embedding set. We release our code for
    the method duplicability.

    \ is the embedded ability to detect sarcasm in order to enhance the performance\
    \ of sentiment classification. We first constructed an affect-cognition-sociolinguistics\

    \ expressions from general tweets. For sentiment prediction, we developed CrystalNest\u2013\
    \ a two-level cascade classification system using features combining sarcasm score\
    \ derived from our sarcasm classifier, sentiment scores from Alchemy, NRC lexicon,\
    \ n-grams, word embedding vectors, and part-of-speech features. We found that\

  abstract: 'We present a simple supervised text classification system that combines
    sparse and dense vector representations of words, and generalized representations
    of words via clusters. The sparse vectors are generated from word n-gram sequences
    (1-3). The dense vector representations of words (embeddings) are learned by training
    a neural network to predict neighboring words in a large unlabeled dataset. To
    classify a text segment, the different representations of it are concatenated,
    and the classification is performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our system
    is particularly intended for use by non-experts of natural language processing
    and machine learning, and, therefore, the system does not require any manual tuning
    of parameters or weights. Given a training set, the system automatically generates
    the training vectors, optimizes the relevant hyper-parameters for the SVM classifier,
    and trains the classification model. We evaluated this system on the SemEval-2017
    English sentiment analysis task. In terms of average F1-score, our system obtained
    8th position out of 39 submissions (F1-score: 0.632, average recall: 0.637, accuracy:
    0.646).'

  abstract: In many areas, such as social science, politics or market research, people
    need to deal with dataset shifting over time. Distribution drift phenomenon usually
    appears in the field of sentiment analysis, when proportions of instances are
    changing over time. In this case, the task is to correctly estimate proportions
    of each sentiment expressed in the set of documents (quantification task). Basically,
    our study was aimed to analyze the effectiveness of a mixture of quantification
    technique with one of deep learning architecture. All the techniques are evaluated
    using the SemEval-2017 Task4 dataset and source code, mentioned in this paper
    and available online in the Python programming language. The results of an application
    of the quantification techniques are discussed.

  abstract: A CNN method for sentiment classification task in Task 4A of SemEval 2017
    is presented. To solve the problem of word2vec training word vector slowly, a
    method of training word vector by integrating word2vec and Convolutional Neural
    Network (CNN) is proposed. This training method not only improves the training
    speed of word2vec, but also makes the word vector more effective for the target
    task. Furthermore, the word2vec adopts a full connection between the input layer
    and the projection layer of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) for acquiring the
    semantic information of the original sentence.

    of a convolutional layer followed by a fully-connected layer and a Softmax on
    top. Ten instances of this network are initialized with the same word embeddings
    as inputs but with different initializations for the network weights. We combine
    the results of all instances by selecting the sentiment label given by the majority
    of the ten voters. This system is ranked fourth in SemEval-2017 Task4 over 38
    systems with 67.4% average recall.

  abstract: The SSN MLRG1 team for Semeval-2017 task 4 has applied Gaussian Process,
    with bag of words feature vectors and fixed rule multi-kernel learning, for sentiment
    analysis of tweets. Since tweets on the same topic, made at different times, may
    exhibit different emotions, their properties such as smoothness and periodicity
    also vary with time. Our experiments show that, compared to single kernel, multiple
    kernels are effective in learning the simultaneous presence of multiple properties.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the central issues in Natural Language Processing
    and has become more and more important in many fields. Typical sentiment analysis
    classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes (e.g.,positive
    or negative). In this paper we describe our deep learning system(combining GRU
    and SVM) to solve both two-, three- and five-tweet polarity classifications. We
    first trained a gated recurrent neural network using pre-trained word embeddings,
    then we extracted features from GRU layer and input these features into support
    vector machine to fulfill both the classification and quantification subtasks.
    The proposed approach achieved 37th, 19th, and 14rd places in subtasks A, B and
    C, respectively.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the approach we used for SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment
    Analysis in Twitter. Topic-based (target-dependent) sentiment analysis has become
    attractive and been used in some applications recently, but it is still a challenging
    research task. In our approach, we take the left and right context of a target
    into consideration when generating polarity classification features. We use two
    types of word embeddings in our classifiers: the general word embeddings learned
    from 200 million tweets, and sentiment-specific word embeddings learned from 10
    million tweets using distance supervision. We also incorporate a text feature
    model in our algorithm. This model produces features based on text negation, tf.idf
    weighting scheme, and a Rocchio text classification method. We participated in
    four subtasks (B, C, D & E for English), all of which are about topic-based message
    polarity classification. Our team is ranked #6 in subtask B, #3 by MAEu and #9
    by MAEm in subtask C, #3 using RAE and #6 using KLD in subtask D, and #3 in subtask
    E.'

  abstract: This paper describes the system we submitted to SemEval-2017 Task 4 (Sentiment
    Analysis in Twitter), specifically subtasks A, B, and D. Our main focus was topic-based
    message polarity classification on a two-point scale (subtask B). The system we
    submitted uses a Support Vector Machine classifier with rich set of features,
    ranging from standard to more creative, task-specific features, including a series
    of rating-based features as well as features that account for sentimental reminiscence
    of past topics and deceased famous people. Our system ranked 14th out of 39 submissions
    in subtask A, 5th out of 24 submissions in subtask B, and 3rd out of 16 submissions
    in subtask D.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a multi-channel convolutional neural network-long
    short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model that consists of two parts: multi-channel CNN
    and LSTM to analyze the sentiments of short English messages from Twitter. Un-like
    a conventional CNN, the proposed model applies a multi-channel strategy that uses
    several filters of different length to extract active local n-gram features in
    different scales. This information is then sequentially composed using LSTM. By
    combining both CNN and LSTM, we can consider both local information within tweets
    and long-distance dependency across tweets in the classification process. Officially
    released results show that our system outperforms the baseline algo-rithm.'

  abstract: This paper describes the submission of team TSA-INF to SemEval-2017 Task
    4 Subtask A. The submitted system is an ensemble of three varying deep learning
    architectures for sentiment analysis. The core of the architecture is a convolutional
    neural network that performs well on text classification as is. The second subsystem
    is a gated recurrent neural network implementation. Additionally, the third system
    integrates opinion lexicons directly into a convolution neural network architecture.
    The resulting ensemble of the three architectures achieved a top ten ranking with
    a macro-averaged recall of 64.3%. Additional results comparing variations of the
    submitted system are not conclusive enough to determine a best architecture, but
    serve as a benchmark for further implementations.

    Analysis in Twitter developed by the UCSC-NLP team. We studied how relationships
    between sense n-grams and sentiment polarities can contribute to this task, i.e.
    co-occurrences of WordNet senses in the tweet, and the polarity. Furthermore,
    we evaluated the effect of discarding a large set of features based on char-grams
    reported in preceding works. Based on these elements, we developed a SVM system,
    which exploring SentiWordNet as a polarity lexicon. It achieves an F1=0.624of
    average. Among 39 submissions to this task, we ranked 10th. of average. Among
    39 submissions to this task, we ranked 10th.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe a methodology to infer Bullish or Bearish sentiment
    towards companies/brands. More specifically, our approach leverages affective
    lexica and word embeddings in combination with convolutional neural networks to
    infer the sentiment of financial news headlines towards a target company. Such
    architecture was used and evaluated in the context of the SemEval 2017 challenge
    (task 5, subtask 2), in which it obtained the best performance.

  abstract: The system developed by the SSN_MLRG1 team for Semeval-2017 task 5 on
    fine-grained sentiment analysis uses Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process for identifying
    the optimistic and pessimistic sentiments associated with companies and stocks.
    Since the comments made at different times about the same companies and stocks
    may display different emotions, their properties such as smoothness and periodicity
    may vary. Our experiments show that while single kernel Gaussian Process can learn
    certain properties well, Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process are effective in learning
    the presence of different properties simultaneously.

    Our system participated in both tracks. For microblogs track, a supervised learning
    approach was adopted and the regressor was trained using XgBoost regression algorithm
    on lexicon features. For news headlines track, an ensemble of regressors was used
    to predict sentiment score. One regressor was trained using TF-IDF features and
    another was trained using the n-gram features. The source code is available at

  abstract: In this Paper a system for solving SemEval-2017 Task 5 is presented. This
    task is divided into two tracks where the sentiment of microblog messages and
    news headlines has to be predicted. Since two submissions were allowed, two different
    machine learning methods were developed to solve this task, a support vector machine
    approach and a recurrent neural network approach. To feed in data for these approaches,
    different feature extraction methods are used, mainly word representations and
    lexica. The best submissions for both tracks are provided by the recurrent neural
    network which achieves a F1-score of 0.729 in track 1 and 0.702 in track 2.

  abstract: This paper describes a supervised solution for detecting the polarity
    scores of tweets or headline news in the financial domain, submitted to the SemEval
    2017 Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News Task. The
    premise is that it is possible to understand market reaction over a company stock
    by measuring the positive/negative sentiment contained in the financial tweets
    and news headlines, where polarity is measured in a continuous scale ranging from
    -1.0 (very bearish) to 1.0 (very bullish). Our system receives as input the textual
    content of tweets or news headlines, together with their ids, stock cashtag or
    name of target company, and the polarity score gold standard for the training
    dataset. Our solution retrieves features from these text instances using n-gram,
    hashtags, sentiment score calculated by a external APIs and others features to
    train a regression model capable to detect continuous score of these sentiments
    with precision.

  abstract: Task 5 of SemEval-2017 involves fine-grained sentiment analysis on financial
    microblogs and news. Our solution for determining the sentiment score extends
    an earlier convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis in several ways.
    We explicitly encode a focus on a particular company, we apply a data augmentation
    scheme, and use a larger data collection to complement the small training data
    provided by the task organizers. The best results were achieved by training a
    model on an external dataset and then tuning it using the provided training dataset.

  abstract: Short length, multi-targets, target relation-ship, monetary expressions,
    and outside reference are characteristics of financial tweets. This paper proposes
    methods to extract target spans from a tweet and its referencing web page. Total
    15 publicly available sentiment dictionaries and one sentiment dictionary constructed
    from training set, containing sentiment scores in binary or real numbers, are
    used to compute the sentiment scores of text spans. Moreover, the correlation
    coeffi-cients of the price return between any two stocks are learned with the
    price data from Bloomberg. They are used to capture the relationships between
    the interesting tar-get and other stocks mentioned in a tweet. The best result
    of our method in both sub-task are 56.68% and 55.43%, evaluated by evaluation
    method 2.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the opinion expressed
    in text. Recently it has been used to study behavioral finance, and in particular
    the effect of opinions and emotions on economic or financial decisions. SemEval-2017
    task 5 focuses on the financial market as the domain for sentiment analysis of
    text; specifically, task 5, subtask 1 focuses on financial tweets about stock
    symbols. In this paper, we describe a machine learning classifier for binary classification
    of financial tweets. We used natural language processing techniques and the random
    forest algorithm to train our model, and tuned it for the training dataset of
    Task 5, subtask 1. Our system achieves the 7th rank on the leaderboard of the
    task.

    Messages and News Statements & Headlines is based on linguistic preprocessing,
    feature engineering, and supervised machine learning techniques. To train our
    model, we used Neural Network Regression, Linear Regression, Boosted Decision
    Tree Regression and Decision Forrest Regression classifiers to forecast sentiment
    scores. At the end, we present an error measure, so as to improve the performance
    about forecasting methods of the system.

  abstract: This paper discusses the approach taken by the UWaterloo team to arrive
    at a solution for the Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis problem posed by Task 5
    of SemEval 2017. The paper describes the document vectorization and sentiment
    score prediction techniques used, as well as the design and implementation decisions
    taken while building the system for this task. The system uses text vectorization
    models, such as N-gram, TF-IDF and paragraph embeddings, coupled with regression
    model variants to predict the sentiment scores. Amongst the methods examined,
    unigrams and bigrams coupled with simple linear regression obtained the best baseline
    accuracy. The paper also explores data augmentation methods to supplement the
    training dataset. This system was designed for Subtask 2 (News Statements and
    Headlines).

    \ on which entity they are affecting (e.g., \u2018decreasing debt\u2019 is positive,\
    \ but \u2018decreasing profit\u2019 is negative). The presented approach yielded\

  abstract: This paper describes our systems submitted to the Fine-Grained Sentiment
    Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News task (i.e., Task 5) in SemEval-2017.
    This task includes two subtasks in microblogs and news headline domain respectively.
    To settle this problem, we extract four types of effective features, including
    linguistic features, sentiment lexicon features, domain-specific features and
    word embedding features. Then we employ these features to construct models by
    using ensemble regression algorithms. Our submissions rank 1st and rank 5th in
    subtask 1 and subtask 2 respectively.

    of the art deep learning sentiment analysis algorithms like Convolution Neural
    Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) along with feature based models
    to identify optimistic or pessimistic sentiments associated with companies and
    stocks in financial texts. We build our system to participate in a competition
    organized by Semantic Evaluation 2017 International Workshop. We combined predictions
    from various models using an artificial neural network to determine the opinion
    towards an entity in (a) Microblog Messages and (b) News Headlines data. Our models
    achieved a cosine similarity score of 0.751 and 0.697 for the above two tracks
    giving us the rank of 2nd and 7th best team respectively.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the approach developed at the Faculty of Engineering
    of University of Porto, to participate in SemEval 2017, Task 5: Fine-grained Sentiment
    Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News. The task consisted in predicting a
    real continuous variable from -1.0 to +1.0 representing the polarity and intensity
    of sentiment concerning companies/stocks mentioned in short texts. We modeled
    the task as a regression analysis problem and combined traditional techniques
    such as pre-processing short texts, bag-of-words representations and lexical-based
    features with enhanced financial specific bag-of-embeddings. We used an external
    collection of tweets and news headlines mentioning companies/stocks from S&P 500
    to create financial word embeddings which are able to capture domain-specific
    syntactic and semantic similarities. The resulting approach obtained a cosine
    similarity score of 0.69 in sub-task 5.1 - Microblogs and 0.68 in sub-task 5.2
    - News Headlines.'

  abstract: This paper describes the improvements that we have applied on CAMR baseline
    parser (Wang et al., 2016) at Task 8 of SemEval-2016. Our objective is to increase
    the performance of CAMR when parsing sentences from scientific articles, especially
    articles of biology domain more accurately. To achieve this goal, we built two
    wrapper layers for CAMR. The first layer, which covers the input data, will normalize,
    add necessary information to the input sentences to make the input dependency
    parser and the aligner better handle reference citations, scientific figures,
    formulas, etc. The second layer, which covers the output data, will modify and
    standardize output data based on a list of scientific concept fixing patterns.
    This will help CAMR better handle biological concepts which are not in the training
    dataset. Finally, after applying our approach, CAMR has scored 0.65 F-score on
    the test set of Biomedical training data and 0.61 F-score on the official blind
    test dataset.

  abstract: We present a neural encoder-decoder AMR parser that extends an attention-based
    model by predicting the alignment between graph nodes and sentence tokens explicitly
    with a pointer mechanism. Candidate lemmas are predicted as a pre-processing step
    so that the lemmas of lexical concepts, as well as constant strings, are factored
    out of the graph linearization and recovered through the predicted alignments.
    The approach does not rely on syntactic parses or extensive external resources.
    Our parser obtained 59% Smatch on the SemEval test set.

  abstract: By addressing both text-to-AMR parsing and AMR-to-text generation, SemEval-2017
    Task 9 established AMR as a powerful semantic interlingua. We strengthen the interlingual
    aspect of AMR by applying the multilingual Grammatical Framework (GF) for AMR-to-text
    generation. Our current rule-based GF approach completely covered only 12.3% of
    the test AMRs, therefore we combined it with state-of-the-art JAMR Generator to
    see if the combination increases or decreases the overall performance. The combined
    system achieved the automatic BLEU score of 18.82 and the human Trueskill score
    of 107.2, to be compared to the plain JAMR Generator results. As for AMR parsing,
    we added NER extensions to our SemEval-2016 general-domain AMR parser to handle
    the biomedical genre, rich in organic compound names, achieving Smatch F1=54.0%.

  abstract: We evaluate a semantic parser based on a character-based sequence-to-sequence
    model in the context of the SemEval-2017 shared task on semantic parsing for AMRs.
    With data augmentation, super characters, and POS-tagging we gain major improvements
    in performance compared to a baseline character-level model. Although we improve
    on previous character-based neural semantic parsing models, the overall accuracy
    is still lower than a state-of-the-art AMR parser. An ensemble combining our neural
    semantic parser with an existing, traditional parser, yields a small gain in performance.

  abstract: This paper describes the system presented by the LABDA group at SemEval
    2017 Task 10 ScienceIE, specifically for the subtasks of identification and classification
    of keyphrases from scientific articles. For the task of identification, we use
    the BANNER tool, a named entity recognition system, which is based on conditional
    random fields (CRF) and has obtained successful results in the biomedical domain.
    To classify keyphrases, we study the UMLS semantic network and propose a possible
    linking between the keyphrase types and the UMLS semantic groups. Based on this
    semantic linking, we create a dictionary for each keyphrase type. Then, a feature
    indicating if a token is found in one of these dictionaries is incorporated to
    feature set used by the BANNER tool. The final results on the test dataset show
    that our system still needs to be improved, but the conditional random fields
    and, consequently, the BANNER system can be used as a first approximation to identify
    and classify keyphrases.

  abstract: This study describes the design of the NTNU system for the ScienceIE task
    at the SemEval 2017 workshop. We use self-defined feature templates and multiple
    conditional random fields with extracted features to identify keyphrases along
    with categorized labels and their relations from scientific publications. A total
    of 16 teams participated in evaluation scenario 1 (subtasks A, B, and C), with
    only 7 teams competing in all sub-tasks. Our best micro-averaging F1 across the
    three subtasks is 0.23, ranking in the middle among all 16 submissions.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our participation at the subtask of extraction
    of relationships between two identified keyphrases. This task can be very helpful
    in improving search engines for scientific articles. Our approach is based on
    the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the training dataset.
    This deep learning model has already achieved successful results for the extraction
    relationships between named entities. Thus, our hypothesis is that this model
    can be also applied to extract relations between keyphrases. The official results
    of the task show that our architecture obtained an F1-score of 0.38% for Keyphrases
    Relation Classification. This performance is lower than the expected due to the
    generic preprocessing phase and the basic configuration of the CNN model, more
    complex architectures are proposed as future work to increase the classification
    rate.

  abstract: This paper describes our TTI-COIN system that participated in SemEval-2017
    Task 10. We investigated appropriate embeddings to adapt a neural end-to-end entity
    and relation extraction system LSTM-ER to this task. We participated in the full
    task setting of the entity segmentation, entity classification and relation classification
    (scenario 1) and the setting of relation classification only (scenario 3). The
    system was directly applied to the scenario 1 without modifying the codes thanks
    to its generality and flexibility. Our evaluation results show that the choice
    of appropriate pre-trained embeddings affected the performance significantly.
    With the best embeddings, our system was ranked third in the scenario 1 with the
    micro F1 score of 0.38. We also confirm that our system can produce the micro
    F1 score of 0.48 for the scenario 3 on the test data, and this score is close
    to the score of the 3rd ranked system in the task.

    only utilizing a transformed version of word embeddings trained at Wikipedia,
    our proposed system manages to perform among the best participating systems in

    extraction from clinical narratives in the context of the 2017 Clinical TempEval
    challenge. Clinical TempEval 2017 addressed the problem of temporal reasoning
    in the clinical domain by providing annotated clinical notes, pathology and radiology
    reports in line with Clinical TempEval challenges 2015/16, across two different
    evaluation phases focusing on cross domain adaptation. Our team focused on subtasks
    involving extractions of temporal spans and relations for which the developed
    systems showed average F-score of 0.45 and 0.47 across the two phases of evaluations.

  abstract: This study proposes a system to participate in the Clinical TempEval 2017
    shared task, a part of the SemEval 2017 Tasks. Domain adaptation was the main
    challenge this year. We took part in the supervised domain adaption where data
    of 591 records of colon cancer patients and 30 records of brain cancer patients
    from Mayo clinic were given and we are asked to analyze the records from brain
    cancer patients. Based on the THYME corpus released by the organizer of Clinical
    TempEval, we propose a framework that automatically analyzes clinical temporal
    events in a fine-grained level. Support vector machine (SVM) and conditional random
    field (CRF) were implemented in our system for different subtasks, including detecting
    clinical relevant events and time expression, determining their attributes, and
    identifying their relations with each other within the document. The results showed
    the capability of domain adaptation of our system.

  abstract: 'This paper presents our approach to participate in the SemEval 2017 Task
    12: Clinical TempEval challenge, specifically in the event and time expressions
    span and attribute identification subtasks (ES, EA, TS, TA). Our approach consisted
    in training Conditional Random Fields (CRF) classifiers using the provided annotations,
    and in creating manually curated rules to classify the attributes of each event
    and time expression. We used a set of common features for the event and time CRF
    classifiers, and a set of features specific to each type of entity, based on domain
    knowledge. Training only on the source domain data, our best F-scores were 0.683
    and 0.485 for event and time span identification subtasks. When adding target
    domain annotations to the training data, the best F-scores obtained were 0.729
    and 0.554, for the same subtasks. We obtained the second highest F-score of the
    challenge on the event polarity subtask (0.708). The source code of our system,
    Clinical Timeline Annotation (CiTA), is available at https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/CiTA.'

  abstract: Clinical TempEval 2017 (SemEval 2017 Task 12) addresses the task of cross-domain
    temporal extraction from clinical text. We present a system for this task that
    uses supervised learning for the extraction of temporal expression and event spans
    with corresponding attributes and narrative container relations. Approaches include
    conditional random fields and decision tree ensembles, using lexical, syntactic,
    semantic, distributional, and rule-based features. Our system received best or
    second best scores in TIMEX3 span, EVENT span, and CONTAINS relation extraction.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the system of the KULeuven-LIIR submission
    for Clinical TempEval 2017. We participated in all six subtasks, using a combination
    of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for event and temporal expression detection,
    and a structured perceptron for extracting temporal relations. Moreover, we present
    and analyze the results from our submissions, and verify the effectiveness of
    several system components. Our system performed above average for all subtasks
    in both phases.
