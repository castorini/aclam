  abstract: 'In this document we report on a user-scenario-based evaluation aiming
    at assessing the performance of machine translation (MT) systems in a real context
    of use. We describe a sequel of experiments that has been performed to estimate
    the usefulness of MT and to test if improvements of MT technology lead to better
    performance in the usage scenario. One goal is to find the best methodology for
    evaluating the eventual benefit of a machine translation system in an application.
    The evaluation is based on the QTLeap corpus, a novel multilingual language resource
    that was collected through a real-life support service via chat. It is composed
    of naturally occurring utterances produced by users while interacting with a human
    technician providing answers. The corpus is available in eight different languages:
    Basque, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English, German, Portuguese and Spanish.'

  abstract: "Out-of-vocabulary words (OOVs) are a ubiquitous and difficult problem\
    \ in statistical machine translation (SMT). This paper studies different strategies\
    \ of using BabelNet to alleviate the negative impact brought about by OOVs. BabelNet\
    \ is a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and a semantic network, which not\
    \ only includes lexicographic and encyclopedic terms, but connects concepts and\
    \ named entities in a very large network of semantic relations. By taking advantage\
    \ of the knowledge in BabelNet, three different methods \u2015 using direct training\
    \ data, domain-adaptation techniques and the BabelNet API \u2015 are proposed\
    \ in this paper to obtain translations for OOVs to improve system performance.\
    \ Experimental results on English\u2015Polish and English\u2015Chinese language\
    \ pairs show that domain adaptation can better utilize BabelNet knowledge and\
    \ performs better than other methods. The results also demonstrate that BabelNet\
    \ is a really useful tool for improving translation performance of SMT systems."

  abstract: While an increasing number of (automatic) metrics is available to assess
    the linguistic quality of machine translations, their interpretation remains cryptic
    to many users, specifically in the translation community. They are clearly useful
    for indicating certain overarching trends, but say little about actual improvements
    for translation buyers or post-editors. However, these metrics are commonly referenced
    when discussing pricing and models, both with translation buyers and service providers.
    With the aim of focusing on automatic metrics that are easier to understand for
    non-research users, we identified Edit Distance (or Post-Edit Distance) as a good
    fit. While Edit Distance as such does not express cognitive effort or time spent
    editing machine translation suggestions, we found that it correlates strongly
    with the productivity tests we performed, for various language pairs and domains.
    This paper aims to analyse Edit Distance and productivity data on a segment level
    based on data gathered over some years. Drawing from these findings, we want to
    then explore how Edit Distance could help in predicting productivity on new content.
    Some further analysis is proposed, with findings to be presented at the conference.

  abstract: We present a freely available corpus containing source language texts
    from different domains along with their automatically generated translations into
    several distinct morphologically rich languages, their post-edited versions, and
    error annotations of the performed post-edit operations. We believe that the corpus
    will be useful for many different applications. The main advantage of the approach
    used for creation of the corpus is the fusion of post-editing and error classification
    tasks, which have usually been seen as two independent tasks, although naturally
    they are not. We also show benefits of coupling automatic and manual error classification
    which facilitates the complex manual error annotation task as well as the development
    of automatic error classification tools. In addition, the approach facilitates
    annotation of language pair related issues.

  abstract: "Existing Arabic sentiment lexicons have low coverage\u2015with only a\
    \ few thousand entries. In this paper, we present several large sentiment lexicons\
    \ that were automatically generated using two different methods: (1) by using\
    \ distant supervision techniques on Arabic tweets, and (2) by translating English\
    \ sentiment lexicons into Arabic using a freely available statistical machine\
    \ translation system. We compare the usefulness of new and old sentiment lexicons\
    \ in the downstream application of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Our baseline\
    \ sentiment analysis system uses numerous surface form features. Nonetheless,\
    \ the system benefits from using additional features drawn from sentiment lexicons.\
    \ The best result is obtained using the automatically generated Dialectal Hashtag\
    \ Lexicon and the Arabic translations of the NRC Emotion Lexicon (accuracy of\
    \ 66.6%). Finally, we describe a qualitative study of the automatic translations\
    \ of English sentiment lexicons into Arabic, which shows that about 88% of the\
    \ automatically translated entries are valid for English as well. Close to 10%\
    \ of the invalid entries are caused by gross mistranslations, close to 40% by\
    \ translations into a related word, and about 50% by differences in how the word\
    \ is used in Arabic."

  abstract: Sentiment Analysis systems aims at detecting opinions and sentiments that
    are expressed in texts. Many approaches in literature are based on resources that
    model the prior polarity of words or multi-word expressions, i.e. a polarity lexicon.
    Such resources are defined by teams of annotators, i.e. a manual annotation is
    provided to associate emotional or sentiment facets to the lexicon entries. The
    development of such lexicons is an expensive and language dependent process, making
    them often not covering all the linguistic sentiment phenomena. Moreover, once
    a lexicon is defined it can hardly be adopted in a different language or even
    a different domain. In this paper, we present several Distributional Polarity
    Lexicons (DPLs), i.e. large-scale polarity lexicons acquired with an unsupervised
    methodology based on Distributional Models of Lexical Semantics. Given a set of
    heuristically annotated sentences from Twitter, we transfer the sentiment information
    from sentences to words. The approach is mostly unsupervised, and experimental
    evaluations on Sentiment Analysis tasks in two languages show the benefits of
    the generated resources. The generated DPLs are publicly available in English
    and Italian.

  abstract: A key point in Sentiment Analysis is to determine the polarity of the
    sentiment implied by a certain word or expression. In basic Sentiment Analysis
    systems this sentiment polarity of the words is accounted and weighted in different
    ways to provide a degree of positivity/negativity. Currently words are also modelled
    as continuous dense vectors, known as word embeddings, which seem to encode interesting
    semantic knowledge. With regard to Sentiment Analysis, word embeddings are used
    as features to more complex supervised classification systems to obtain sentiment
    classifiers. In this paper we compare a set of existing sentiment lexicons and
    sentiment lexicon generation techniques. We also show a simple but effective technique
    to calculate a word polarity value for each word in a domain using existing continuous
    word embeddings generation methods. Further, we also show that word embeddings
    calculated on in-domain corpus capture the polarity better than the ones calculated
    on general-domain corpus.

  abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is an important part of dialogue analysis which
    can be used in order to improve the quality of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs).
    The emotional hypothesis of the current response of an end-user might be utilised
    by the dialogue manager component in order to change the SDS strategy which could
    result in a quality enhancement. In this study additional speaker-related information
    is used to improve the performance of the speech-based ER process. The analysed
    information is the speaker identity, gender and age of a user. Two schemes are
    described here, namely, using additional information as an independent variable
    within the feature vector and creating separate emotional models for each speaker,
    gender or age-cluster independently. The performances of the proposed approaches
    were compared against the baseline ER system, where no additional information
    has been used, on a number of emotional speech corpora of German, English, Japanese
    and Russian. The study revealed that for some of the corpora the proposed approach
    significantly outperforms the baseline methods with a relative difference of up
    to 11.9%.

  abstract: 'We address the task of automatically estimating the missing values of
    linguistic features by making use of the fact that some linguistic features in
    typological databases are informative to each other. The questions to address
    in this work are (i) how much predictive power do features have on the value of
    another feature? (ii) to what extent can we attribute this predictive power to
    genealogical or areal factors, as opposed to being provided by tendencies or implicational
    universals? To address these questions, we conduct a discriminative or predictive
    analysis on the typological database. Specifically, we use a machine-learning
    classifier to estimate the value of each feature of each language using the values
    of the other features, under different choices of training data: all the other
    languages, or all the other languages except for the ones having the same origin
    or area with the target language.'

  abstract: We present a study of the adequacy of current methods that are used for
    POS-tagging historical Dutch texts, as well as an exploration of the influence
    of employing different techniques to improve upon the current practice. The main
    focus of this paper is on (unsupervised) methods that are easily adaptable for
    different domains without requiring extensive manual input. It was found that
    modernising the spelling of corpora prior to tagging them with a tagger trained
    on contemporary Dutch results in a large increase in accuracy, but that spelling
    normalisation alone is not sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art results. The
    best results were achieved by training a POS-tagger on a corpus automatically
    annotated by projecting (automatically assigned) POS-tags via word alignments
    from a contemporary corpus. This result is promising, as it was reached without
    including any domain knowledge or context dependencies. We argue that the insights
    of this study combined with semi-supervised learning techniques for domain adaptation
    can be used to develop a general-purpose diachronic tagger for Dutch.

  abstract: In this paper we present a language resource for German, composed of a
    list of 1,021 unique errors extracted from a collection of texts written by people
    with dyslexia. The errors were annotated with a set of linguistic characteristics
    as well as visual and phonetic features. We present the compilation and the annotation
    criteria for the different types of dyslexic errors. This language resource has
    many potential uses since errors written by people with dyslexia reflect their
    difficulties. For instance, it has already been used to design language exercises
    to treat dyslexia in German. To the best of our knowledge, this is first resource
    of this kind in German.

  abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research
    on unsupervised NLP. Various unsupervised and semi-supervised methods have been
    proposed to tag an unseen language. However, many of them require some partial
    understanding of the target language because they rely on dictionaries or parallel
    corpora such as the Bible. In this paper, we propose a different method named
    delexicalized tagging, for which we only need a raw corpus of the target language.
    We transfer tagging models trained on annotated corpora of one or more resource-rich
    languages. We employ language-independent features such as word length, frequency,
    neighborhood entropy, character classes (alphabetic vs. numeric vs. punctuation)
    etc. We demonstrate that such features can, to certain extent, serve as predictors
    of the part of speech, represented by the universal POS tag.

  abstract: 'This paper describes a method to automatically create dialogue resources
    annotated with dialogue act information by reusing existing dialogue corpora.
    Numerous dialogue corpora are available for research purposes and many of them
    are annotated with dialogue act information that captures the intentions encoded
    in user utterances. Annotated dialogue resources, however, differ in various respects:
    data collection settings and modalities used, dialogue task domains and scenarios
    (if any) underlying the collection, number and roles of dialogue participants
    involved and dialogue act annotation schemes applied. The presented study encompasses
    three phases of data-driven investigation. We, first, assess the importance of
    various types of features and their combinations for effective cross-domain dialogue
    act classification. Second, we establish the best predictive model comparing various
    cross-corpora training settings. Finally, we specify models adaptation procedures
    and explore late fusion approaches to optimize the overall classification decision
    taking process. The proposed methodology accounts for empirically motivated and
    technically sound classification procedures that may reduce annotation and training
    costs significantly.'

  abstract: In this paper, we present a taxonomy of stories told in dialogue. We based
    our scheme on prior work analyzing narrative structure and method of telling,
    relation to storyteller identity, as well as some categories particular to dialogue,
    such as how the story gets introduced. Our taxonomy currently has 5 major dimensions,
    with most having sub-dimensions - each dimension has an associated set of dimension-specific
    labels. We adapted an annotation tool for this taxonomy and have annotated portions
    of two different dialogue corpora, Switchboard and the Distress Analysis Interview
    Corpus. We present examples of some of the tags and concepts with stories from
    Switchboard, and some initial statistics of frequencies of the tags.

  abstract: PentoRef is a corpus of task-oriented dialogues collected in systematically
    manipulated settings. The corpus is multilingual, with English and German sections,
    and overall comprises more than 20000 utterances. The dialogues are fully transcribed
    and annotated with referring expressions mapped to objects in corresponding visual
    scenes, which makes the corpus a rich resource for research on spoken referring
    expressions in generation and resolution. The corpus includes several sub-corpora
    that correspond to different dialogue situations where parameters related to interactivity,
    visual access, and verbal channel have been manipulated in systematic ways. The
    corpus thus lends itself to very targeted studies of reference in spontaneous
    dialogue.

  abstract: "Spoken conversation corpora often adapt existing Dialogue Act (DA) annotation\
    \ specifications, such as DAMSL, DIT++, etc., to task specific needs, yielding\
    \ incompatible annotations; thus, limiting corpora re-usability. Recently accepted\
    \ ISO standard for DA annotation \u2013 Dialogue Act Markup Language (DiAML) \u2013\
    \ is designed as domain and application independent. Moreover, the clear separation\
    \ of dialogue dimensions and communicative functions, coupled with the hierarchical\
    \ organization of the latter, allows for classification at different levels of\
    \ granularity. However, re-annotating existing corpora with the new scheme might\
    \ require significant effort. In this paper we test the utility of the ISO standard\
    \ through comparative evaluation of the corpus-specific legacy and the semi-automatically\
    \ transferred DiAML DA annotations on supervised dialogue act classification task.\
    \ To test the domain independence of the resulting annotations, we perform cross-domain\
    \ and data aggregation evaluation. Compared to the legacy annotation scheme, on\
    \ the Italian LUNA Human-Human corpus, the DiAML annotation scheme exhibits better\

  abstract: This paper presents WikiCoref, an English corpus annotated for anaphoric
    relations, where all documents are from the English version of Wikipedia. Our
    annotation scheme follows the one of OntoNotes with a few disparities. We annotated
    each markable with coreference type, mention type and the equivalent Freebase
    topic. Since most similar annotation efforts concentrate on very specific types
    of written text, mainly newswire, there is a lack of resources for otherwise over-used
    Wikipedia texts. The corpus described in this paper addresses this issue. We present
    a freely available resource we initially devised for improving coreference resolution
    algorithms dedicated to Wikipedia texts. Our corpus has no restriction on the
    topics of the documents being annotated, and documents of various sizes have been
    considered for annotation.

  abstract: "The aim of distributional semantics is to model the similarity of the\
    \ meaning of words via the words they occur with. Thereby, it relies on the distributional\
    \ hypothesis implying that similar words have similar contexts. Deducing meaning\
    \ from the distribution of words is interesting as it can be done automatically\
    \ on large amounts of freely available raw text. It is because of this convenience\
    \ that most current state-of-the-art-models of distributional semantics operate\
    \ on raw text, although there have been successful attempts to integrate other\
    \ kinds of\u2015e.g., syntactic\u2015information to improve distributional semantic\
    \ models. In contrast, less attention has been paid to semantic information in\
    \ the research community. One reason for this is that the extraction of semantic\
    \ information from raw text is a complex, elaborate matter and in great parts\
    \ not yet satisfyingly solved. Recently, however, there have been successful attempts\
    \ to integrate a certain kind of semantic information, i.e., co-reference. Two\
    \ basically different kinds of information contributed by co-reference with respect\
    \ to the distribution of words will be identified. We will then focus on one of\
    \ these and examine its general potential to improve distributional semantic models\
    \ as well as certain more specific hypotheses."

  abstract: "We describe challenges and advantages unique to coreference resolution\
    \ in the biomedical domain, and a sieve-based architecture that leverages domain\
    \ knowledge for both entity and event coreference resolution. Domain-general coreference\
    \ resolution algorithms perform poorly on biomedical documents, because the cues\
    \ they rely on such as gender are largely absent in this domain, and because they\
    \ do not encode domain-specific knowledge such as the number and type of participants\
    \ required in chemical reactions. Moreover, it is difficult to directly encode\
    \ this knowledge into most coreference resolution algorithms because they are\
    \ not rule-based. Our rule-based architecture uses sequentially applied hand-designed\
    \ \u201Csieves\u201D, with the output of each sieve informing and constraining\
    \ subsequent sieves. This architecture provides a 3.2% increase in throughput\
    \ to our Reach event extraction system with precision parallel to that of the\
    \ stricter system that relies solely on syntactic patterns for extraction."

  abstract: 'Characters form the focus of various studies of literary works, including
    social network analysis, archetype induction, and plot comparison. The recent
    rise in the computational modelling of literary works has produced a proportional
    rise in the demand for character-annotated literary corpora. However, automatically
    identifying characters is an open problem and there is low availability of literary
    texts with manually labelled characters. To address the latter problem, this work
    presents three contributions: (1) a comprehensive scheme for manually resolving
    mentions to characters in texts. (2) A novel collaborative annotation tool, CHARLES
    (CHAracter Resolution Label-Entry System) for character annotation and similiar
    cross-document tagging tasks. (3) The character annotations resulting from a pilot
    study on the novel Pride and Prejudice, demonstrating the scheme and tool facilitate
    the efficient production of high-quality annotations. We expect this work to motivate
    the further production of annotated literary corpora to help meet the demand of
    the community.'

  abstract: In most international industries, English is the main language of communication
    for technical documents. These documents are designed to be as unambiguous as
    possible for their users. For international industries based in non-English speaking
    countries, the professionals in charge of writing requirements are often non-native
    speakers of English, who rarely receive adequate training in the use of English
    for this task. As a result, requirements can contain a relatively large diversity
    of lexical and grammatical errors, which are not eliminated by the use of guidelines
    from controlled languages. This article investigates the distribution of errors
    in a corpus of requirements written in English by native speakers of French. Errors
    are defined on the basis of grammaticality and acceptability principles, and classified
    using comparable categories. Results show a high proportion of errors in the Noun
    Phrase, notably through modifier stacking, and errors consistent with simplification
    strategies. Comparisons with similar corpora in other genres reveal the specificity
    of the distribution of errors in requirements. This research also introduces possible
    applied uses, in the form of strategies for the automatic detection of errors,
    and in-person training provided by certification boards in requirements authoring.

  abstract: We present a novel method to automatically improve the accurracy of part-of-speech
    taggers on learner language. The key idea underlying our approach is to exploit
    the structure of a typical language learner task and automatically induce POS
    information for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. To evaluate the effectiveness of
    our approach, we add manual POS and normalization information to an existing language
    learner corpus. Our evaluation shows an increase in accurracy from 72.4% to 81.5%
    on OOV words.

    \ Framework of Reference (CEFR). SweLL consists of three subcorpora \u2015 SpIn,\
    \ SW1203 and Tisus, collected from three different educational establishments.\
    \ The common metadata for all subcorpora includes age, gender, native languages,\
    \ time of residence in Sweden, type of written task. Depending on the subcorpus,\
    \ learner texts may contain additional information, such as text genres, topics,\
    \ grades. Five of the six CEFR levels are represented in the corpus: A1, A2, B1,\
    \ B2 and C1 comprising in total 339 essays. C2 level is not included since courses\
    \ at C2 level are not offered. The work flow consists of collection of essays\
    \ and permits, essay digitization and registration, meta-data annotation, automatic\
    \ linguistic annotation. Inter-rater agreement is presented on the basis of SW1203\
    \ subcorpus. The work on SweLL is still ongoing with more that 100 essays waiting\
    \ in the pipeline. This article both describes the resource and the \u201Chow-to\u201D\
    \ behind the compilation of SweLL."

  abstract: The paper introduces SVALex, a lexical resource primarily aimed at learners
    and teachers of Swedish as a foreign and second language that describes the distribution
    of 15,681 words and expressions across the Common European Framework of Reference
    (CEFR). The resource is based on a corpus of coursebook texts, and thus describes
    receptive vocabulary learners are exposed to during reading activities, as opposed
    to productive vocabulary they use when speaking or writing. The paper describes
    the methodology applied to create the list and to estimate the frequency distribution.
    It also discusses some characteristics of the resulting resource and compares
    it to other lexical resources for Swedish. An interesting feature of this resource
    is the possibility to separate the wheat from the chaff, identifying the core
    vocabulary at each level, i.e. vocabulary shared by several coursebook writers
    at each level, from peripheral vocabulary which is used by the minority of the
    coursebook writers.

  abstract: Automated grammatical error detection, which helps users improve their
    writing, is an important application in NLP. Recently more and more people are
    learning Chinese, and an automated error detection system can be helpful for the
    learners. This paper proposes n-gram features, dependency count features, dependency
    bigram features, and single-character features to determine if a Chinese sentence
    contains word usage errors, in which a word is written as a wrong form or the
    word selection is inappropriate. With marking potential errors on the level of
    sentence segments, typically delimited by punctuation marks, the learner can try
    to correct the problems without the assistant of a language teacher. Experiments
    on the HSK corpus show that the classifier combining all sets of features achieves
    an accuracy of 0.8423. By utilizing certain combination of the sets of features,
    we can construct a system that favors precision or recall. The best precision
    we achieve is 0.9536, indicating that our system is reliable and seldom produces
    misleading results.

  abstract: We present a light-weight machine learning tool for NLP research. The
    package supports operations on both discrete and dense vectors, facilitating implementation
    of linear models as well as neural models. It provides several basic layers which
    mainly aims for single-layer linear and non-linear transformations. By using these
    layers, we can conveniently implement linear models and simple neural models.
    Besides, this package also integrates several complex layers by composing those
    basic layers, such as RNN, Attention Pooling, LSTM and gated RNN. Those complex
    layers can be used to implement deep neural models directly.

  abstract: "This study examines two possibilities of using the FLELex graded lexicon\
    \ for the automated assessment of text complexity in French as a foreign language\
    \ learning. From the lexical frequency distributions described in FLELex, we derive\
    \ a single level of difficulty for each word in a parallel corpus of original\
    \ and simplified texts. We then use this data to automatically address the lexical\
    \ complexity of texts in two ways. On the one hand, we evaluate the degree of\
    \ lexical simplification in manually simplified texts with respect to their original\
    \ version. Our results show a significant simplification effect, both in the case\
    \ of French narratives simplified for non-native readers and in the case of simplified\
    \ Wikipedia texts. On the other hand, we define a predictive model which identifies\
    \ the number of words in a text that are expected to be known at a particular\
    \ learning level. We assess the accuracy with which these predictions are able\
    \ to capture actual word knowledge as reported by Dutch-speaking learners of French.\
    \ Our study shows that although the predictions seem relatively accurate in general\
    \ (87.4% to 92.3%), they do not yet seem to cover the learners\u2019 lack of knowledge\
    \ very well."

    \ is a modified version of the conventional readability formulas such as Flesch\

    \ which considers aspects of script usually dropped in informal Arabic writing.\
    \ To evaluate our methods we used Spearman\u2019s correlation metric to compare\
    \ text readability for 73,000 parallel sentences from English and Arabic UN documents.\
    \ The Arabic sentences were written with the absence of diacritics and in order\
    \ to count the number of syllables we added the diacritics in using an open source\

  abstract: Enabling users of intelligent systems to enhance the system performance
    by providing feedback on their errors is an important need. However, the ability
    of systems to learn from user feedback is difficult to evaluate in an objective
    and comparative way. Indeed, the involvement of real users in the adaptation process
    is an impediment to objective evaluation. This issue can be solved by using an
    oracle approach, where users are simulated by oracles having access to the reference
    test data. Another difficulty is to find a meaningful metric despite the fact
    that system improvements depend on the feedback provided and on the system itself.
    A solution is to measure the minimal amount of information needed to correct all
    system errors. It can be shown that for any well defined non interactive task,
    the interactively supervised version of the task can be evaluated by combining
    such an oracle-based approach and a minimum supervision rate metric. This new
    evaluation protocol for adaptive systems is not only expected to drive progress
    for such systems, but also to pave the way for a specialisation of actors along
    the value chain of their technological development.

  abstract: This paper addresses the problem of quantifying the differences between
    entity extraction systems, where in general only a small proportion a document
    should be selected. Comparing overall accuracy is not very useful in these cases,
    as small differences in accuracy may correspond to huge differences in selections
    over the target minority class. Conventionally, one may use per-token complementarity
    to describe these differences, but it is not very useful when the set is heavily
    skewed. In such situations, which are common in information retrieval and entity
    recognition, metrics like precision and recall are typically used to describe
    performance. However, precision and recall fail to describe the differences between
    sets of objects selected by different decision strategies, instead just describing
    the proportional amount of correct and incorrect objects selected. This paper
    presents a method for measuring complementarity for precision, recall and F-score,
    quantifying the difference between entity extraction approaches.

  abstract: Opinion Mining is a topic which attracted a lot of interest in the last
    years. By observing the literature, it is often hard to replicate system evaluation
    due to the unavailability of the data used for the evaluation or to the lack of
    details about the protocol used in the campaign. In this paper, we propose an
    evaluation protocol, called DRANZIERA, composed of a multi-domain dataset and
    guidelines allowing both to evaluate opinion mining systems in different contexts
    (Closed, Semi-Open, and Open) and to compare them to each other and to a number
    of baselines.

  abstract: Web corpora are often constructed automatically, and their contents are
    therefore often not well understood. One technique for assessing the composition
    of such a web corpus is to empirically measure its similarity to a reference corpus
    whose composition is known. In this paper we evaluate a number of measures of
    corpus similarity, including a method based on topic modelling which has not been
    previously evaluated for this task. To evaluate these methods we use known-similarity
    corpora that have been previously used for this purpose, as well as a number of
    newly-constructed known-similarity corpora targeting differences in genre, topic,
    time, and region. Our findings indicate that, overall, the topic modelling approach
    did not improve on a chi-square method that had previously been found to work
    well for measuring corpus similarity.

  abstract: This contribution presents the background, design and results of a study
    of users of three oral corpus platforms in Germany. Roughly 5.000 registered users
    of the Database for Spoken German (DGD), the GeWiss corpus and the corpora of
    the Hamburg Centre for Language Corpora (HZSK) were asked to participate in a
    user survey. This quantitative approach was complemented by qualitative interviews
    with selected users. We briefly introduce the corpus resources involved in the
    study in section 2. Section 3 describes the methods employed in the user studies.
    Section 4 summarizes results of the studies focusing on selected key topics. Section
    5 attempts a generalization of these results to larger contexts.

  abstract: 'In this paper we describe a corpus of automatic translations annotated
    with both error type and quality. The 300 sentences that we have selected were
    generated by Google Translate, Systran and two in-house Machine Translation systems
    that use Moses technology. The errors present on the translations were annotated
    with an error taxonomy that divides errors in five main linguistic categories
    (Orthography, Lexis, Grammar, Semantics and Discourse), reflecting the language
    level where the error is located. After the error annotation process, we accessed
    the translation quality of each sentence using a four point comprehension scale
    from 1 to 5. Both tasks of error and quality annotation were performed by two
    different annotators, achieving good levels of inter-annotator agreement. The
    creation of this corpus allowed us to use it as training data for a translation
    quality classifier. We concluded on error severity by observing the outputs of
    two machine learning classifiers: a decision tree and a regression model.'

  abstract: This paper presents an approach for automatic evaluation of the readability
    of text simplification output for readers with cognitive disabilities. First,
    we present our work towards the development of the EasyRead corpus, which contains
    easy-to-read documents created especially for people with cognitive disabilities.
    We then compare the EasyRead corpus to the simplified output contained in the
    LocalNews corpus (Feng, 2009), the accessibility of which has been evaluated through
    reading comprehension experiments including 20 adults with mild intellectual disability.
    This comparison is made on the basis of 13 disability-specific linguistic features.
    The comparison reveals that there are no major differences between the two corpora,
    which shows that the EasyRead corpus is to a similar reading level as the user-evaluated
    texts. We also discuss the role of Simple Wikipedia (Zhu et al., 2010) as a widely-used
    accessibility benchmark, in light of our finding that it is significantly more
    complex than both the EasyRead and the LocalNews corpora.

  abstract: Word embeddings have been successfully used in several natural language
    processing tasks (NLP) and speech processing. Different approaches have been introduced
    to calculate word embeddings through neural networks. In the literature, many
    studies focused on word embedding evaluation, but for our knowledge, there are
    still some gaps. This paper presents a study focusing on a rigorous comparison
    of the performances of different kinds of word embeddings. These performances
    are evaluated on different NLP and linguistic tasks, while all the word embeddings
    are estimated on the same training data using the same vocabulary, the same number
    of dimensions, and other similar characteristics. The evaluation results reported
    in this paper match those in the literature, since they point out that the improvements
    achieved by a word embedding in one task are not consistently observed across
    all tasks. For that reason, this paper investigates and evaluates approaches to
    combine word embeddings in order to take advantage of their complementarity, and
    to look for the effective word embeddings that can achieve good performances on
    all tasks. As a conclusion, this paper provides new perceptions of intrinsic qualities
    of the famous word embedding families, which can be different from the ones provided
    by works previously published in the scientific literature.

  abstract: In this paper, we claim that the CAMOMILE collaborative annotation platform
    (developed in the framework of the eponymous CHIST-ERA project) eases the organization
    of multimedia technology benchmarks, automating most of the campaign technical
    workflow and enabling collaborative (hence faster and cheaper) annotation of the
    evaluation data. This is demonstrated through the successful organization of a
    new multimedia task at MediaEval 2015, Multimodal Person Discovery in Broadcast
    TV.

  abstract: This paper discusses a methodology to measure the usability of machine
    translated content by end users, comparing lightly post-edited content with raw
    output and with the usability of source language content. The content selected
    consists of Online Help articles from a software company for a spreadsheet application,
    translated from English into German. Three groups of five users each used either
    the source text - the English version (EN) -, the raw MT version (DE_MT), or the
    light PE version (DE_PE), and were asked to carry out six tasks. Usability was
    measured using an eye tracker and cognitive, temporal and pragmatic measures of
    usability. Satisfaction was measured via a post-task questionnaire presented after
    the participants had completed the tasks.

  abstract: 'This project assesses the resources necessary to make oral history searchable
    by means of automatic speech recognition (ASR). There are many inherent challenges
    in applying ASR to conversational speech: smaller training set sizes and varying
    demographics, among others. We assess the impact of dataset size, word error rate
    and term-weighted value on human search capability through an information retrieval
    task on Mechanical Turk. We use English oral history data collected by StoryCorps,
    a national organization that provides all people with the opportunity to record,
    share and preserve their stories, and control for a variety of demographics including
    age, gender, birthplace, and dialect on four different training set sizes. We
    show comparable search performance using a standard speech recognition system
    as with hand-transcribed data, which is promising for increased accessibility
    of conversational speech and oral history archives.'

  abstract: Breaking news on economic events such as stock splits or mergers and acquisitions
    has been shown to have a substantial impact on the financial markets. As it is
    important to be able to automatically identify events in news items accurately
    and in a timely manner, we present in this paper proof-of-concept experiments
    for a supervised machine learning approach to economic event detection in newswire
    text. For this purpose, we created a corpus of Dutch financial news articles in
    which 10 types of company-specific economic events were annotated. We trained
    classifiers using various lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We obtain
    good results based on a basic set of shallow features, thus showing that this
    method is a viable approach for economic event detection in news text.

  abstract: "Predictive modeling, often called \u201Cpredictive analytics\u201D in\
    \ a commercial context, encompasses a variety of statistical techniques that analyze\
    \ historical and present facts to make predictions about unknown events. Often\
    \ the unknown events are in the future, but prediction can be applied to any type\
    \ of unknown whether it be in the past or future. In our case, we present some\
    \ experiments applying predictive modeling to the usage of technical terms within\
    \ the NLP domain."

  abstract: This paper presents the Gavagai Living Lexicon, which is an online distributional
    semantic model currently available in 20 different languages. We describe the
    underlying distributional semantic model, and how we have solved some of the challenges
    in applying such a model to large amounts of streaming data. We also describe
    the architecture of our implementation, and discuss how we deal with continuous
    quality assurance of the lexicon.

  abstract: Social media outlets are providing new opportunities for harvesting valuable
    resources. We present a novel approach for mining data from Twitter for the purpose
    of building transliteration resources and systems. Such resources are crucial
    in translation and retrieval tasks. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach
    on Arabic to English transliteration. The contribution of this approach includes
    the size of data that can be collected and exploited within the span of a limited
    time; the approach is very generic and can be adopted to other languages and the
    ability of the approach to cope with new transliteration phenomena and trends.
    A statistical transliteration system built using this data improved a comparable
    system built from Wikipedia wikilinks data.

  abstract: Many emerging documents usually contain temporal information. Because
    the temporal information is useful for various applications, it became important
    to develop a system of extracting the temporal information from the documents.
    Before developing the system, it first necessary to define or design the structure
    of temporal information. In other words, it is necessary to design a language
    which defines how to annotate the temporal information. There have been some studies
    about the annotation languages, but most of them was applicable to only a specific
    target language (e.g., English). Thus, it is necessary to design an individual
    annotation language for each language. In this paper, we propose a revised version
    of Koreain Time Mark-up Language (K-TimeML), and also introduce a dataset, named
    Korean TimeBank, that is constructed basd on the K-TimeML. We believe that the
    new K-TimeML and Korean TimeBank will be used in many further researches about
    extraction of temporal information.

  abstract: "Hypernymy relations (those where an hyponym term shares a \u201Cisa\u201D\
    \ relationship with his hypernym) play a key role for many Natural Language Processing\
    \ (NLP) tasks, e.g. ontology learning, automatically building or extending knowledge\

    \ we developed to iterate over the web corpus for extracting the hypernymy relations\
    \ and store them effectively into a large database. This collection of relations\

  abstract: 'The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of two statistical
    machine translation (SMT) systems within a cross-language information retrieval
    (CLIR) architecture and examine if there is a correlation between translation
    quality and CLIR performance. The SMT systems were KantanMT, a cloud-based machine
    translation (MT) platform, and Moses, an open-source MT application. First we
    trained both systems using the same language resources: the EMEA corpus for the
    translation model and language model and the QTLP corpus for tuning. Then we translated
    the 63 queries of the OHSUMED test collection from Greek into English using both
    MT systems. Next, we ran the queries on the document collection using Apache Solr
    to get a list of the top ten matches. The results were compared to the OHSUMED
    gold standard. KantanMT achieved higher average precision and F-measure than Moses,
    while both systems produced the same recall score. We also calculated the BLEU
    score for each system using the ECDC corpus. Moses achieved a higher BLEU score
    than KantanMT. Finally, we also tested the IR performance of the original English
    queries. This work overall showed that CLIR performance can be better even when
    BLEU score is worse.'

  abstract: "This work analyses a corpus made of the titles of research projects belonging\
    \ to the last four European Commission Framework Programmes (FP4, FP5, FP6, FP7)\
    \ during a time span of nearly two decades (1994-2012). The starting point is\
    \ the idea of creating a corpus of titles which would constitute a terminological\
    \ niche, a sort of \u201Ccluster map\u201D offering an overall vision on the terms\
    \ used and the links between them. Moreover, by performing a terminological comparison\
    \ over a period of time it is possible to trace the presence of obsolete words\
    \ in outdated research areas as well as of neologisms in the most recent fields.\
    \ Within this scenario, the minimal purpose is to build a corpus of titles of\
    \ European projects belonging to the several Framework Programmes in order to\
    \ obtain a terminological mapping of relevant words in the various research areas:\
    \ particularly significant would be those terms spread across different domains\
    \ or those extremely tied to a specific domain. A term could actually be found\
    \ in many fields and being able to acknowledge and retrieve this cross-presence\
    \ means being able to linking those different domains by means of a process of\
    \ terminological mapping."

  abstract: The paper investigates the extent of the support semi-automatic analysis
    can provide for the specific task of assigning Hohfeldian relations of Duty, using
    the General Architecture for Text Engineering tool for the automated extraction
    of Duty instances and the bearers of associated roles. The outcome of the analysis
    supports scholars in identifying Hohfeldian structures in legal text when performing
    close reading of the texts. A cyclic workflow involving automated annotation and
    expert feedback will incrementally increase the quality and coverage of the automatic
    extraction process, and increasingly reduce the amount of manual work required
    of the scholar.

  abstract: The emergence of the web has necessitated the need to detect and correct
    noisy consumer-generated texts. Most of the previous studies on English spelling-error
    extraction collected English spelling errors from web services such as Twitter
    by using the edit distance or from input logs utilizing crowdsourcing. However,
    in the former approach, it is not clear which word corresponds to the spelling
    error, and the latter approach requires an annotation cost for the crowdsourcing.
    One notable exception is Rodrigues and Rytting (2012), who proposed to extract
    English spelling errors by using a word-typing game. Their approach saves the
    cost of crowdsourcing, and guarantees an exact alignment between the word and
    the spelling error. However, they did not assert whether the extracted spelling
    error corpora reflect the usual writing process such as writing a document. Therefore,
    we propose a new correctable word-typing game that is more similar to the actual
    writing process. Experimental results showed that we can regard typing-game logs
    as a source of spelling errors.

  abstract: 'The paper describes automatic definition finding implemented within the
    leading corpus query and management tool, Sketch Engine. The implementation exploits
    complex pattern-matching queries in the corpus query language (CQL) and the indexing
    mechanism of word sketches for finding and storing definition candidates throughout
    the corpus. The approach is evaluated for Czech and English corpora, showing that
    the results are usable in practice: precision of the tool ranges between 30 and
    75 percent (depending on the major corpus text types) and we were able to extract
    nearly 2 million definition candidates from an English corpus with 1.4 billion
    words. The feature is embedded into the interface as a concordance filter, so
    that users can search for definitions of any query to the corpus, including very
    specific multi-word queries. The results also indicate that ordinary texts (unlike
    explanatory texts) contain rather low number of definitions, which is perhaps
    the most important problem with automatic definition finding in general.'

  abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the effect that the use of Basic English
    versus common English has on information extraction from online resources. The
    amount of online information available to the public grows exponentially, and
    is potentially an excellent resource for information extraction. The problem is
    that this information often comes in an unstructured format, such as plain text.
    In order to retrieve knowledge from this type of text, it must first be analysed
    to find the relevant details, and the nature of the language used can greatly
    impact the quality of the extracted information. In this paper, we compare triplets
    that represent definitions or properties of concepts obtained from three online
    collaborative resources (English Wikipedia, Simple English Wikipedia and Simple
    English Wiktionary) and study the differences in the results when Basic English
    is used instead of common English. The results show that resources written in
    Basic English produce less quantity of triplets, but with higher quality.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the evaluation of the translation quality and Cross-Lingual
    Information Retrieval (CLIR) performance when using session information as the
    context of queries. The hypothesis is that previous queries provide context that
    helps to solve ambiguous translations in the current query. We tested several
    strategies on the TREC 2010 Session track dataset, which includes query reformulations
    grouped by generalization, specification, and drifting types. We study the Basque
    to English direction, evaluating both the translation quality and CLIR performance,
    with positive results in both cases. The results show that the quality of translation
    improved, reducing error rate by 12% (HTER) when using session information, which
    improved CLIR results 5% (nDCG). We also provide an analysis of the improvements
    across the three kinds of sessions: generalization, specification, and drifting.
    Translation quality improved in all three types (generalization, specification,
    and drifting), and CLIR improved for generalization and specification sessions,
    preserving the performance in drifting sessions.'

  abstract: This paper presents a new Vietnamese text corpus which contains around
    4.05 billion words. It is a collection of Wikipedia texts, newspaper articles
    and random web texts. The paper describes the process of collecting, cleaning
    and creating the corpus. Processing Vietnamese texts faced several challenges,
    for example, different from many Latin languages, Vietnamese language does not
    use blanks for separating words, hence using common tokenizers such as replacing
    blanks with word boundary does not work. A short review about different approaches
    of Vietnamese tokenization is presented together with how the corpus has been
    processed and created. After that, some statistical analysis on this data is reported
    including the number of syllable, average word length, sentence length and topic
    analysis. The corpus is integrated into a framework which allows searching and
    browsing. Using this web interface, users can find out how many times a particular
    word appears in the corpus, sample sentences where this word occurs, its left
    and right neighbors.

  abstract: Text analysis methods for the automatic identification of emerging technologies
    by analyzing the scientific publications, are gaining attention because of their
    socio-economic impact. The approaches so far have been mainly focused on retrospective
    analysis by mapping scientific topic evolution over time. We propose regression
    based approaches to predict future keyword distribution. The prediction is based
    on historical data of the keywords, which in our case, are LREC conference proceedings.
    Considering the insufficient number of data points available from LREC proceedings,
    we do not employ standard time series forecasting methods. We form a dataset by
    extracting the keywords from previous year proceedings and quantify their yearly
    relevance using tf-idf scores. This dataset additionally contains ranked lists
    of related keywords and experts for each keyword.

  abstract: "Understanding the experimental results of a scientific paper is crucial\
    \ to understanding its contribution and to comparing it with related work. We\
    \ introduce a structured, queryable representation for experimental results and\
    \ a baseline system that automatically populates this representation. The representation\
    \ can answer compositional questions such as: \u201CWhich are the best published\
    \ results reported on the NIST 09 Chinese to English dataset?\u201D and \u201C\
    What are the most important methods for speeding up phrase-based decoding?\u201D\
    \ Answering such questions usually involves lengthy literature surveys. Current\
    \ machine reading for academic papers does not usually consider the actual experiments,\
    \ but mostly focuses on understanding abstracts. We describe annotation work to\
    \ create an initial hscientific paper; experimental results representationi corpus.\
    \ The corpus is composed of 67 papers which were manually annotated with a structured\
    \ representation of experimental results by domain experts. Additionally, we present\
    \ a baseline algorithm that characterizes the difficulty of the inference task."

  abstract: "Domain-specific annotations for NLP are often centered on real-world\
    \ applications of text, and incorrect annotations may be particularly unacceptable.\
    \ In medical text, the process of manual chart review (of a patient\u2019s medical\
    \ record) is error-prone due to its complexity. We propose a staggered NLP-assisted\
    \ approach to the refinement of clinical annotations, an interactive process that\
    \ allows initial human judgments to be verified or falsified by means of comparison\

  abstract: The Dictionaries division at Oxford University Press (OUP) is aiming to
    model, integrate, and publish lexical content for 100 languages focussing on digitally
    under-represented languages. While there are multiple ontologies designed for
    linguistic resources, none had adequate features for meeting our requirements,
    chief of which was the capability to losslessly capture diverse features of many
    different languages in a dictionary format, while supplying a framework for inferring
    relations like translation, derivation, etc., between the data. Building on valuable
    features of existing models, and working with OUP monolingual and bilingual dictionary
    datasets, we have designed and implemented a new linguistic ontology. The ontology
    has been reviewed by a number of computational linguists, and we are working to
    move more dictionary data into it. We have also developed APIs to surface the
    linked data to dictionary websites.

  abstract: 'Language resources (LR) are indispensable for the development of tools
    for machine translation (MT) or various kinds of computer-assisted translation
    (CAT). In particular language corpora, both parallel and monolingual are considered
    most important for instance for MT, not only SMT but also hybrid MT. The Language
    Technology Observatory will provide easy access to information about LRs deemed
    to be useful for MT and other translation tools through its LR Catalogue. In order
    to determine what aspects of an LR are useful for MT practitioners, a user study
    was made, providing a guide to the most relevant metadata and the most relevant
    quality criteria. We have seen that many resources exist which are useful for
    MT and similar work, but the majority are for (academic) research or educational
    use only, and as such not available for commercial use. Our work has revealed
    a list of gaps: coverage gap, awareness gap, quality gap, quantity gap. The paper
    ends with recommendations for a forward-looking strategy.'

  abstract: The NSF-SI2-funded LAPPS Grid project is a collaborative effort among
    Brandeis University, Vassar College, Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and the
    Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), which has developed an open, web-based infrastructure
    through which resources can be easily accessed and within which tailored language
    services can be efficiently composed, evaluated, disseminated and consumed by
    researchers, developers, and students across a wide variety of disciplines. The
    LAPPS Grid project recently adopted Galaxy (Giardine et al., 2005), a robust,
    well-developed, and well-supported front end for workflow configuration, management,
    and persistence. Galaxy allows data inputs and processing steps to be selected
    from graphical menus, and results are displayed in intuitive plots and summaries
    that encourage interactive workflows and the exploration of hypotheses. The Galaxy
    workflow engine provides significant advantages for deploying pipelines of LAPPS
    Grid web services, including not only means to create and deploy locally-run and
    even customized versions of the LAPPS Grid as well as running the LAPPS Grid in
    the cloud, but also access to a huge array of statistical and visualization tools
    that have been developed for use in genomics research.

  abstract: This paper presents an investigation of mirroring facial expressions and
    the emotions which they convey in dyadic naturally occurring first encounters.
    Mirroring facial expressions are a common phenomenon in face-to-face interactions,
    and they are due to the mirror neuron system which has been found in both animals
    and humans. Researchers have proposed that the mirror neuron system is an important
    component behind many cognitive processes such as action learning and understanding
    the emotions of others. Preceding studies of the first encounters have shown that
    overlapping speech and overlapping facial expressions are very frequent. In this
    study, we want to determine whether the overlapping facial expressions are mirrored
    or are otherwise correlated in the encounters, and to what extent mirroring facial
    expressions convey the same emotion. The results of our study show that the majority
    of smiles and laughs, and one fifth of the occurrences of raised eyebrows are
    mirrored in the data. Moreover some facial traits in co-occurring expressions
    co-occur more often than it would be expected by chance. Finally, amusement, and
    to a lesser extent friendliness, are often emotions shared by both participants,
    while other emotions indicating individual affective states such as uncertainty
    and hesitancy are never showed by both participants, but co-occur with complementary
    emotions such as friendliness and support. Whether these tendencies are specific
    to this type of conversations or are more common should be investigated further.

  abstract: The New Yorker publishes a weekly captionless cartoon. More than 5,000
    readers submit captions for it. The editors select three of them and ask the readers
    to pick the funniest one. We describe an experiment that compares a dozen automatic
    methods for selecting the funniest caption. We show that negative sentiment, human-centeredness,
    and lexical centrality most strongly match the funniest captions, followed by
    positive sentiment. These results are useful for understanding humor and also
    in the design of more engaging conversational agents in text and multimodal (vision+text)
    systems. As part of this work, a large set of cartoons and captions is being made
    available to the community.

  abstract: The paper presents a corpus of text data and its corresponding gaze fixations
    obtained from autistic and non-autistic readers. The data was elicited through
    reading comprehension testing combined with eye-tracking recording. The corpus
    consists of 1034 content words tagged with their POS, syntactic role and three
    gaze-based measures corresponding to the autistic and control participants. The
    reading skills of the participants were measured through multiple-choice questions
    and, based on the answers given, they were divided into groups of skillful and
    less-skillful readers. This division of the groups informs researchers on whether
    particular fixations were elicited from skillful or less-skillful readers and
    allows a fair between-group comparison for two levels of reading ability. In addition
    to describing the process of data collection and corpus development, we present
    a study on the effect that word length has on reading in autism. The corpus is
    intended as a resource for investigating the particular linguistic constructions
    which pose reading difficulties for people with autism and hopefully, as a way
    to inform future text simplification research intended for this population.

  abstract: "The ability to efficiently speak in public is an essential asset for\
    \ many professions and is used in everyday life. As such, tools enabling the improvement\
    \ of public speaking performance and the assessment and mitigation of anxiety\
    \ related to public speaking would be very useful. Multimodal interaction technologies,\
    \ such as computer vision and embodied conversational agents, have recently been\
    \ investigated for the training and assessment of interpersonal skills. Once central\
    \ requirement for these technologies is multimodal corpora for training machine\
    \ learning models. This paper addresses the need of these technologies by presenting\
    \ and sharing a multimodal corpus of public speaking presentations. These presentations\
    \ were collected in an experimental study investigating the potential of interactive\
    \ virtual audiences for public speaking training. This corpus includes audio-visual\
    \ data and automatically extracted features, measures of public speaking anxiety\
    \ and personality, annotations of participants\u2019 behaviors and expert ratings\
    \ of behavioral aspects and overall performance of the presenters. We hope this\

  abstract: This paper aims to implement what is referred to as the collocation of
    the Arabic keywords approach for extracting formulaic sequences (FSs) in the form
    of high frequency but semantically regular formulas that are not restricted to
    any syntactic construction or semantic domain. The study applies several distributional
    semantic models in order to automatically extract relevant FSs related to Arabic
    keywords. The data sets used in this experiment are rendered from a new developed
    corpus-based Arabic wordlist consisting of 5,189 lexical items which represent
    a variety of modern standard Arabic (MSA) genres and regions, the new wordlist
    being based on an overlapping frequency based on a comprehensive comparison of
    four large Arabic corpora with a total size of over 8 billion running words. Empirical
    n-best precision evaluation methods are used to determine the best association
    measures (AMs) for extracting high frequency and meaningful FSs. The gold standard
    reference FSs list was developed in previous studies and manually evaluated against
    well-established quantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate
    that the MI.log_f AM achieved the highest results in extracting significant FSs
    from the large MSA corpus, while the T-score association measure achieved the
    worst results.

  abstract: In this paper we present a rule-based method for multi-word term extraction
    that relies on extensive lexical resources in the form of electronic dictionaries
    and finite-state transducers for modelling various syntactic structures of multi-word
    terms. The same technology is used for lemmatization of extracted multi-word terms,
    which is unavoidable for highly inflected languages in order to pass extracted
    data to evaluators and subsequently to terminological e-dictionaries and databases.
    The approach is illustrated on a corpus of Serbian texts from the mining domain
    containing more than 600,000 simple word forms. Extracted and lemmatized multi-word
    terms are filtered in order to reject falsely offered lemmas and then ranked by
    introducing measures that combine linguistic and statistical information (C-Value,
    T-Score, LLR, and Keyness). Mean average precision for retrieval of MWU forms
    ranges from 0.789 to 0.804, while mean average precision of lemma production ranges
    from 0.956 to 0.960. The evaluation showed that 94% of distinct multi-word forms
    were evaluated as proper multi-word units, and among them 97% were associated
    with correct lemmas.

  abstract: "In this paper, we focus on Czech complex predicates formed by a light\
    \ verb and a predicative noun expressed as the direct object. Although Czech \u2015\
    \ as an inflectional language encoding syntactic relations via morphological cases\
    \ \u2015 provides an excellent opportunity to study the distribution of valency\
    \ complements in the syntactic structure with complex predicates, this distribution\
    \ has not been described so far. On the basis of a manual analysis of the richly\
    \ annotated data from the Prague Dependency Treebank, we thus formulate principles\
    \ governing this distribution. In an automatic experiment, we verify these principles\
    \ on well-formed syntactic structures from the Prague Dependency Treebank and\
    \ the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank with very satisfactory results:\
    \ the distribution of 97% of valency complements in the surface structure is governed\
    \ by the proposed principles. These results corroborate that the surface structure\
    \ formation of complex predicates is a regular process."

  abstract: 'A verb-noun Multi-Word Expression (MWE) is a combination of a verb and
    a noun with or without other words, in which the combination has a meaning different
    from the meaning of the words considered separately. In this paper, we present
    a new lexical resource of Hebrew Verb-Noun MWEs (VN-MWEs). The VN-MWEs of this
    resource were manually collected and annotated from five different web resources.
    In addition, we analyze the lexical properties of Hebrew VN-MWEs by classifying
    them to three types: morphological, syntactic, and semantic. These two contributions
    are essential for designing algorithms for automatic VN-MWEs extraction. The analysis
    suggests some interesting features of VN-MWEs for exploration. The lexical resource
    enables to sample a set of positive examples for Hebrew VN-MWEs. This set of examples
    can either be used for training supervised algorithms or as seeds in unsupervised
    bootstrapping algorithms. Thus, this resource is a first step towards automatic
    identification of Hebrew VN-MWEs, which is important for natural language understanding,
    generation and translation systems.'

  abstract: This paper presents SemLinker, an open source system that discovers named
    entities, connects them to a reference knowledge base, and clusters them semantically.
    SemLinker relies on several modules that perform surface form generation, mutual
    disambiguation, entity clustering, and make use of two annotation engines. SemLinker
    was evaluated in the English Entity Discovery and Linking track of the Text Analysis
    Conference on Knowledge Base Population, organized by the US National Institute
    of Standards and Technology. Along with the SemLinker source code, we release
    our annotation files containing the discovered named entities, their types, and
    position across processed documents.

  abstract: More and more knowledge bases are publicly available as linked data. Since
    these knowledge bases contain structured descriptions of real-world entities,
    they can be exploited by entity linking systems that anchor entity mentions from
    text to the most relevant resources describing those entities. In this paper,
    we investigate adaptation of the entity linking task using contextual knowledge.
    The key intuition is that entity linking can be customized depending on the textual
    content, as well as on the application that would make use of the extracted information.
    We present an adaptive approach that relies on contextual knowledge from text
    to enhance the performance of ADEL, a hybrid linguistic and graph-based entity
    linking system. We evaluate our approach on a domain-specific corpus consisting
    of annotated WikiNews articles.

  abstract: Recently, due to the increasing popularity of social media, the necessity
    for extracting information from informal text types, such as microblog texts,
    has gained significant attention. In this study, we focused on the Named Entity
    Recognition (NER) problem on informal text types for Turkish. We utilized a semi-supervised
    learning approach based on neural networks. We applied a fast unsupervised method
    for learning continuous representations of words in vector space. We made use
    of these obtained word embeddings, together with language independent features
    that are engineered to work better on informal text types, for generating a Turkish
    NER system on microblog texts. We evaluated our Turkish NER system on Twitter
    messages and achieved better F-score performances than the published results of
    previously proposed NER systems on Turkish tweets. Since we did not employ any
    language dependent features, we believe that our method can be easily adapted
    to microblog texts in other morphologically rich languages.

  abstract: "The task of Named Entity Linking is to link entity mentions in the document\
    \ to their correct entries in a knowledge base and to cluster NIL mentions. Ambiguous,\
    \ misspelled, and incomplete entity mention names are the main challenges in the\
    \ linking process. We propose a novel approach that combines two state-of-the-art\
    \ models \u2015 for entity disambiguation and for paraphrase detection \u2015\
    \ to overcome these challenges. We consider name variations as paraphrases of\
    \ the same entity mention and adopt a paraphrase model for this task. Our approach\
    \ utilizes a graph-based disambiguation model based on Personalized Page Rank,\
    \ and then refines and clusters its output using the paraphrase similarity between\
    \ entity mention strings. It achieves a competitive performance of 80.5% in B3+F\

  abstract: In this paper we explain how we created a labelled corpus in English for
    a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task from multi-source and multi-domain data,
    for an industrial partner. We explain the specificities of this corpus with examples
    and describe some baseline experiments. We present some results of domain adaptation
    on this corpus using a labelled Twitter corpus (Ritter et al., 2011). We tested
    a semi-supervised method from (Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2014) combined with a
    supervised domain adaptation approach proposed in (Raymond and Fayolle, 2010)
    for machine learning experiments with CRFs (Conditional Random Fields). We use
    the same technique to improve the NER results on the Twitter corpus (Ritter et
    al., 2011). Our contributions thus consist in an industrial corpus creation and
    NER performance improvements.

  abstract: We describe IRIS, a statistical machine translation (SMT) system for translating
    from English into Irish and vice versa. Since Irish is considered an under-resourced
    language with a limited amount of machine-readable text, building a machine translation
    system that produces reasonable translations is rather challenging. As translation
    is a difficult task, current research in SMT focuses on obtaining statistics either
    from a large amount of parallel, monolingual or other multilingual resources.
    Nevertheless, we collected available English-Irish data and developed an SMT system
    aimed at supporting human translators and enabling cross-lingual language technology
    tasks.

  abstract: "The present article reports on efforts to improve the translation accuracy\
    \ of a corpus\u2015based Machine Translation (MT) system. In order to achieve\
    \ that, an error analysis performed on past translation outputs has indicated\
    \ the likelihood of improving the translation accuracy by augmenting the coverage\
    \ of the Target-Language (TL) side language model. The method adopted for improving\
    \ the language model is initially presented, based on the concatenation of consecutive\
    \ phrases. The algorithmic steps are then described that form the process for\
    \ augmenting the language model. The key idea is to only augment the language\
    \ model to cover the most frequent cases of phrase sequences, as counted over\
    \ a TL-side corpus, in order to maximize the cases covered by the new language\
    \ model entries. Experiments presented in the article show that substantial improvements\
    \ in translation accuracy are achieved via the proposed method, when integrating\
    \ the grown language model to the corpus-based MT system."

  abstract: An open-source rule-based machine translation system is developed for
    Scots, a low-resourced minor language closely related to English and spoken in
    Scotland and Ireland. By concentrating on translation for assimilation (gist comprehension)
    from Scots to English, it is proposed that the development of dictionaries designed
    to be used with in the Apertium platform will be sufficient to produce translations
    that improve non-Scots speakers understanding of the language. Mono- and bilingual
    Scots dictionaries are constructed using lexical items gathered from a variety
    of resources across several domains. Although the primary goal of this project
    is translation for gisting, the system is evaluated for both assimilation and
    dissemination (publication-ready translations). A variety of evaluation methods

    results are comparable to, and in some cases superior to, those of other language
    pairs within the Apertium platform, room for improvement is identified in several

  abstract: "This paper describes a hybrid machine translation system that explores\
    \ a parser to acquire syntactic chunks of a source sentence, translates the chunks\
    \ with multiple online machine translation (MT) system application program interfaces\
    \ (APIs) and creates output by combining translated chunks to obtain the best\
    \ possible translation. The selection of the best translation hypothesis is performed\
    \ by calculating the perplexity for each translated chunk. The goal of this approach\
    \ is to enhance the baseline multi-system hybrid translation (MHyT) system that\
    \ uses only a language model to select best translation from translations obtained\
    \ with different APIs and to improve overall English \u2015 Latvian machine translation\
    \ quality over each of the individual MT APIs. The presented syntax-based multi-system\
    \ translation (SyMHyT) system demonstrates an improvement in terms of BLEU and\
    \ NIST scores compared to the baseline system. Improvements reach from 1.74 up\
    \ to 2.54 BLEU points."

  abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Machine Translation (MT) for
    a specialised domain in a language pair for which only a very small domain-specific
    parallel corpus is available. We conduct a series of experiments using a purely
    phrase-based SMT (PBSMT) system and a hybrid MT system (TectoMT), testing three
    different strategies to overcome the problem of the small amount of in-domain
    training data. Our results show that adding a small size in-domain bilingual terminology
    to the small in-domain training corpus leads to the best improvements of a hybrid
    MT system, while the PBSMT system achieves the best results by adding a combination
    of in-domain bilingual terminology and a larger out-of-domain corpus. We focus
    on qualitative human evaluation of the output of two best systems (one for each
    approach) and perform a systematic in-depth error analysis which revealed advantages
    of the hybrid MT system over the pure PBSMT system for this specific task.

    \ related to the collection and analysis of the data. The corpus design is inspired\
    \ by the HCRC Map Task Corpus which was initially designed to support the investigation\

    \ that used replications of the map task to investigate communication in computer\

  abstract: We propose named entity abstraction methods with fine-grained named entity
    labels for improving statistical machine translation (SMT). The methods are based
    on a bilingual named entity recognizer that uses a monolingual named entity recognizer
    with transliteration. Through experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained
    named entities into statistical machine translation improves the accuracy of SMT
    with more adequate granularity compared with the standard SMT, which is a non-named
    entity abstraction method.

  abstract: In this paper we present our work on the usage of lexical resources for
    the Machine Translation English and Malayalam. We describe a comparative performance
    between different Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems on top of phrase
    based SMT system as baseline. We explore different ways of utilizing lexical resources
    to improve the quality of English Malayalam statistical machine translation. In
    order to enrich the training corpus we have augmented the lexical resources in
    two ways (a) additional vocabulary and (b) inflected verbal forms. Lexical resources
    include IndoWordnet semantic relation set, lexical words and verb phrases etc.
    We have described case studies, evaluations and have given detailed error analysis
    for both Malayalam to English and English to Malayalam machine translation systems.
    We observed significant improvement in evaluations of translation quality. Lexical
    resources do help uplift performance when parallel corpora are scanty.

  abstract: 'We present PROTEST, a test suite for the evaluation of pronoun translation
    by MT systems. The test suite comprises 250 hand-selected pronoun tokens and an
    automatic evaluation method which compares the translations of pronouns in MT
    output with those in the reference translation. Pronoun translations that do not
    match the reference are referred for manual evaluation. PROTEST is designed to
    support analysis of system performance at the level of individual pronoun groups,
    rather than to provide a single aggregate measure over all pronouns. We wish to
    encourage detailed analyses to highlight issues in the handling of specific linguistic
    mechanisms by MT systems, thereby contributing to a better understanding of those
    problems involved in translating pronouns. We present two use cases for PROTEST:
    a) for measuring improvement/degradation of an incremental system change, and
    b) for comparing the performance of a group of systems whose design may be largely
    unrelated. Following the latter use case, we demonstrate the application of PROTEST
    to the evaluation of the systems submitted to the DiscoMT 2015 shared task on

  abstract: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word is a crucial problem in statistical machine
    translation (SMT) with low resources. OOV paraphrasing that augments the translation
    model for the OOV words by using the translation knowledge of their paraphrases
    has been proposed to address the OOV problem. In this paper, we propose using
    word embeddings and semantic lexicons for OOV paraphrasing. Experiments conducted
    on a low resource setting of the OLYMPICS task of IWSLT 2012 verify the effectiveness
    of our proposed method.

  abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to predict punctuation marks for
    unsegmented speech transcript. The approach is purely lexical, with pre-trained
    Word Vectors as the only input. A training model of Deep Neural Network (DNN)
    or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to classify whether a punctuation
    mark should be inserted after the third word of a 5-words sequence and which kind
    of punctuation mark the inserted one should be. TED talks within IWSLT dataset

    effectiveness by achieving better result than the state-of-the-art lexical solution
    which works with same type of data, especially when predicting puncuation position

  abstract: Greedy transition-based parsers are appealing for their very fast speed,
    with reasonably high accuracies. In this paper, we build a fast shift-reduce neural
    constituent parser by using a neural network to make local decisions. One challenge
    to the parsing speed is the large hidden and output layer sizes caused by the
    number of constituent labels and branching options. We speed up the parser by
    using a hierarchical output layer, inspired by the hierarchical log-bilinear neural
    language model. In standard WSJ experiments, the neural parser achieves an almost
    2.4 time speed up (320 sen/sec) compared to a non-hierarchical baseline without
    significant accuracy loss (89.06 vs 89.13 F-score).

  abstract: 'We focus on the improvement of accuracy of raw text parsing, from the
    viewpoint of language resource addition. In Japanese, the raw text parsing is
    divided into three steps: word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency
    parsing. We investigate the contribution of language resource addition in each
    of three steps to the improvement in accuracy for two domain corpora. The experimental
    results show that this improvement depends on the target domain. For example,
    when we handle well-written texts of limited vocabulary, white paper, an effective
    language resource is a word-POS pair sequence corpus for the parsing accuracy.
    So we conclude that it is important to check out the characteristics of the target
    domain and to choose a suitable language resource addition strategy for the parsing
    accuracy improvement.'

  abstract: 'We present E-TIPSY, a search query corpus annotated with named Entities,
    Term Importance, POS tags, and SYntactic parses. This corpus contains crowdsourced
    (gold) annotations of the three most important terms in each query. In addition,
    it contains automatically produced annotations of named entities, part-of-speech
    tags, and syntactic parses for the same queries. This corpus comes in two formats:
    (1) Sober Subset: annotations that two or more crowd workers agreed upon, and
    (2) Full Glass: all annotations. We analyze the strikingly low correlation between
    term importance and syntactic headedness, which invites research into effective
    ways of combining these different signals. Our corpus can serve as a benchmark
    for term importance methods aimed at improving search engine quality and as an
    initial step toward developing a dataset of gold linguistic analysis of web search
    queries. In addition, it can be used as a basis for linguistic inquiries into
    the kind of expressions used in search.'

  abstract: Compared to well-resourced languages such as English and Dutch, natural
    language processing (NLP) tools for Afrikaans are still not abundant. In the context
    of the AfriBooms project, KU Leuven and the North-West University collaborated
    to develop a first, small treebank, a dependency parser, and an easy to use online
    linguistic search engine for Afrikaans for use by researchers and students in
    the humanities and social sciences. The search tool is based on a similar development
    for Dutch, i.e. GrETEL, a user-friendly search engine which allows users to query
    a treebank by means of a natural language example instead of a formal search instruction.

  abstract: The Index Thomisticus Treebank is the largest available treebank for Latin;
    it contains Medieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas. After experimenting on its
    data with a number of dependency parsers based on different supervised machine
    learning techniques, we found that DeSR with a multilayer perceptron algorithm,
    a right-to-left transition, and a tailor-made feature model is the parser providing
    the highest accuracy rates. We improved the results further by using a technique
    that combines the output parses of DeSR with those provided by other parsers,
    outperforming the previous state of the art in parsing the Index Thomisticus Treebank.
    The key idea behind such improvement is to ensure a sufficient diversity and accuracy
    of the outputs to be combined; for this reason, we performed an in-depth evaluation
    of the results provided by the different parsers that we combined. Finally, we
    assessed that, although the general architecture of the parser is portable to
    Classical Latin, yet the model trained on Medieval Latin is inadequate for such
    purpose.

  abstract: Phrase chunking remains an important natural language processing (NLP)
    technique for intermediate syntactic processing. This paper describes the development
    of protocols, annotated phrase chunking data sets and automatic phrase chunkers
    for ten South African languages. Various problems with adapting the existing annotation
    protocols of English are discussed as well as an overview of the annotated data
    sets. Based on the annotated sets, CRF-based phrase chunkers are created and tested
    with a combination of different features, including part of speech tags and character
    n-grams. The results of the phrase chunking evaluation show that disjunctively
    written languages can achieve notably better results for phrase chunking with
    a limited data set than conjunctive languages, but that the addition of character
    n-grams improve the results for conjunctive languages.

  abstract: Continuous word representations appeared to be a useful feature in many
    natural language processing tasks. Using fixed-dimension pre-trained word embeddings
    allows avoiding sparse bag-of-words representation and to train models with fewer
    parameters. In this paper, we use fixed pre-trained word embeddings as additional
    features for a neural scoring function in the MST parser. With the multi-layer
    architecture of the scoring function we can avoid handcrafting feature conjunctions.
    The continuous word representations on the input also allow us to reduce the number
    of lexical features, make the parser more robust to out-of-vocabulary words, and
    reduce the total number of parameters of the model. Although its accuracy stays
    below the state of the art, the model size is substantially smaller than with
    the standard features set. Moreover, it performs well for languages where only
    a smaller treebank is available and the results promise to be useful in cross-lingual
    parsing.

    grammar into logical constraints that are analysed by a SAT-solver. We have evaluated
    our analysis on a number of non-trivial grammars and found inconsistencies.

    \ fast and accurate Information Retrieval (IR). Generally, an automated approach\
    \ to such task is considered faster and cheaper than manual systems. Nevertheless,\
    \ results do not seem have a high level of accuracy, indeed, as also Hjorland\
    \ (2007) states, using stochastic algorithms entails: \u2022 Low precision due\
    \ to the indexing of common Atomic Linguistic Units (ALUs) or sentences. \u2022\
    \ Low recall caused by the presence of synonyms. \u2022 Generic results arising\

    \ on invert text index, namely an index data structure storing a mapping from\
    \ content to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents.\
    \ In this paper we propose a system, by means of which we will develop a search\
    \ engine able to process online documents, starting from a natural language query,\
    \ and to return information to users. The proposed approach, based on the Lexicon-Grammar\

  abstract: "The Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging\
    \ (ILSE) was created to facilitate the study of challenges posed by rapidly aging\
    \ societies in developed countries such as Germany. ILSE contains over 8,000 hours\
    \ of biographic interviews recorded from more than 1,000 participants over the\
    \ course of 20 years. Investigations on various aspects of aging, such as cognitive\
    \ decline, often rely on the analysis of linguistic features which can be derived\
    \ from spoken content like these interviews. However, transcribing speech is a\
    \ time and cost consuming manual process and so far only 380 hours of ILSE interviews\
    \ have been transcribed. Thus, it is the aim of our work to establish technical\
    \ systems to fully automatically transcribe the ILSE interview data. The joint\
    \ occurrence of poor recording quality, long audio segments, erroneous transcriptions,\
    \ varying speaking styles & crosstalk, and emotional & dialectal speech in these\
    \ interviews presents challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We describe\
    \ our ongoing work towards the fully automatic transcription of all ILSE interviews\
    \ and the steps we implemented in preparing the transcriptions to meet the interviews\u2019\
    \ challenges. Using a recursive long audio alignment procedure 96 hours of the\

    \ who everyone has only one excerpt. The data were collected from 10 different\
    \ French radio and television shows where each utterance turns with a minimum\
    \ duration of 30s and has a good speech quality. The data set is mainly used for\
    \ investigating speaker factor in forensic voice comparison and interpreting some\
    \ unsolved issue such as the relationship between speaker characteristics and\
    \ system behavior. In this paper, we present FABIOLE database. Then, preliminary\

  abstract: Corpus design for speech synthesis is a well-researched topic in languages
    such as English compared to Modern Standard Arabic, and there is a tendency to
    focus on methods to automatically generate the orthographic transcript to be recorded
    (usually greedy methods). In this work, a study of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
    phonetics and phonology is conducted in order to create criteria for a greedy
    method to create a speech corpus transcript for recording. The size of the dataset
    is reduced a number of times using these optimisation methods with different parameters
    to yield a much smaller dataset with identical phonetic coverage than before the
    reduction, and this output transcript is chosen for recording. This is part of
    a larger work to create a completely annotated and segmented speech corpus for
    MSA.

  abstract: "With emerging conversational data, automated content analysis is needed\
    \ for better data interpretation, so that it is accurately understood and can\

    \ ICSI meeting corpus with a goal of deeply understanding meeting conversations,\
    \ where participant turns are annotated by actionable items that could be performed\
    \ by an automated meeting assistant. In addition to the user utterances that contain\
    \ an actionable item, annotations also include the arguments associated with the\
    \ actionable item. The set of actionable items are determined by aligning human-human\
    \ interactions to human-machine interactions, where a data annotation schema designed\
    \ for a virtual personal assistant (human-machine genre) is adapted to the meetings\
    \ domain (human-human genre). The data set is formed by annotating participants\u2019\
    \ utterances in meetings with potential intents/actions considering their contexts.\
    \ The set of actions target what could be accomplished by an automated meeting\
    \ assistant, such as taking a note of action items that a participant commits\
    \ to, or finding emails or topic related documents that were mentioned during\
    \ the meeting. A total of 10 defined intents/actions are considered as actionable\
    \ items in meetings. Turns that include actionable intents were annotated for\
    \ 22 public ICSI meetings, that include a total of 21K utterances, segmented by\
    \ speaker turns. Participants\u2019 spoken turns, possible actions along with\
    \ associated arguments and their vector representations as computed by convolutional\

  abstract: 'Current state-of-the-art speech synthesizers for domain-independent systems
    still struggle with the challenge of generating understandable and natural-sounding
    speech. This is mainly because the pronunciation of words of foreign origin, inflections
    and compound words often cannot be handled by rules. Furthermore there are too
    many of these for inclusion in exception dictionaries. We describe an approach
    to evaluating text-to-speech synthesizers with a subjective listening experiment.
    The focus is to differentiate between known problem classes for speech synthesizers.
    The target language is German but we believe that many of the described phenomena
    are not language specific. We distinguish the following problem categories: Normalization,
    Foreign linguistics, Natural writing, Language specific and General. Each of them
    is divided into five to three problem classes. Word lists for each of the above
    mentioned categories were compiled and synthesized by both a commercial and an
    open source synthesizer, both being based on the non-uniform unit-selection approach.
    The synthesized speech was evaluated by human judges using the Speechalyzer toolkit
    and the results are discussed. It shows that, as expected, the commercial synthesizer
    performs much better than the open-source one, and especially words of foreign
    origin were pronounced badly by both systems.'

  abstract: Recent spoken dialog systems have been able to recognize freely spoken
    user input in restricted domains thanks to statistical methods in the automatic
    speech recognition. These methods require a high number of natural language utterances
    to train the speech recognition engine and to assess the quality of the system.
    Since human speech offers many variants associated with a single intent, a high
    number of user utterances have to be elicited. Developers are therefore turning
    to crowdsourcing to collect this data. This paper compares three different methods
    to elicit multiple utterances for given semantics via crowd sourcing, namely with
    pictures, with text and with semantic entities. Specifically, we compare the methods
    with regard to the number of valid data and linguistic variance, whereby a quantitative
    and qualitative approach is proposed. In our study, the method with text led to
    a high variance in the utterances and a relatively low rate of invalid data.

  abstract: This paper describes the characteristics and structure of a Basque singing
    voice database of bertsolaritza. Bertsolaritza is a popular singing style from
    Basque Country sung exclusively in Basque that is improvised and a capella. The
    database is designed to be used in statistical singing voice synthesis for bertsolaritza
    style. Starting from the recordings and transcriptions of numerous singers, diarization
    and phoneme alignment experiments have been made to extract the singing voice
    from the recordings and create phoneme alignments. This labelling processes have
    been performed applying standard speech processing techniques and the results
    prove that these techniques can be used in this specific singing style.

  abstract: Auditory voice quality judgements are used intensively for the clinical
    assessment of pathological voice. Voice quality concepts are fuzzily defined and
    poorly standardized however, which hinders scientific and clinical communication.
    The described database documents a wide variety of pathologies and is used to
    investigate auditory voice quality concepts with regard to phonation mechanisms.
    The database contains 375 laryngeal high-speed videos and simultaneous high-quality
    audio recordings of sustained phonations of 80 pathological and 40 non-pathological
    subjects. Interval wise annotations regarding video and audio quality, as well
    as voice quality ratings are provided. Video quality is annotated for the visibility
    of anatomical structures and artefacts such as blurring or reduced contrast. Voice
    quality annotations include ratings on the presence of dysphonia and diplophonia.
    The purpose of the database is to aid the formulation of observationally well-founded
    models of phonation and the development of model-based automatic detectors for
    distinct types of phonation, especially for clinically relevant nonmodal voice
    phenomena. Another application is the training of audio-based fundamental frequency
    extractors on video-based reference fundamental frequencies.

  abstract: In this paper the authors present a speech corpus designed and created
    for the development and evaluation of dictation systems in Latvian. The corpus
    consists of over nine hours of orthographically annotated speech from 30 different
    speakers. The corpus features spoken commands that are common for dictation systems
    for text editors. The corpus is evaluated in an automatic speech recognition scenario.
    Evaluation results in an ASR dictation scenario show that the addition of the
    corpus to the acoustic model training data in combination with language model
    adaptation allows to decrease the WER by up to relative 41.36% (or 16.83% in absolute
    numbers) compared to a baseline system without language model adaptation. Contribution
    of acoustic data augmentation is at relative 12.57% (or 3.43% absolute).

  abstract: 'This paper introduces the LetsRead Corpus of European Portuguese read
    speech from 6 to 10 years old children. The motivation for the creation of this
    corpus stems from the inexistence of databases with recordings of reading tasks
    of Portuguese children with different performance levels and including all the
    common reading aloud disfluencies. It is also essential to develop techniques
    to fulfill the main objective of the LetsRead project: to automatically evaluate
    the reading performance of children through the analysis of reading tasks. The
    collected data amounts to 20 hours of speech from 284 children from private and
    public Portuguese schools, with each child carrying out two tasks: reading sentences
    and reading a list of pseudowords, both with varying levels of difficulty throughout
    the school grades. In this paper, the design of the reading tasks presented to
    children is described, as well as the collection procedure. Manually annotated
    data is analyzed according to disfluencies and reading performance. The considered
    word difficulty parameter is also confirmed to be suitable for the pseudoword
    reading tasks.'

  abstract: Language resources, such as corpora, are important for various natural
    language processing tasks. Urdu has millions of speakers around the world but
    it is under-resourced in terms of standard evaluation resources. This paper reports
    the construction of a benchmark corpus for Urdu summaries (abstracts) to facilitate
    the development and evaluation of single document summarization systems for Urdu
    language. In Urdu, space does not always mark word boundary. Therefore, we created
    two versions of the same corpus. In the first version, words are separated by
    space. In contrast, proper word boundaries are manually tagged in the second version.
    We further apply normalization, part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis,
    lemmatization, and stemming for the articles and their summaries in both versions.
    In order to apply these annotations, we re-implemented some NLP tools for Urdu.
    We provide Urdu Summary Corpus, all these annotations and the needed software
    tools (as open-source) for researchers to run experiments and to evaluate their
    work including but not limited to single-document summarization task.

  abstract: In this paper we report our effort to construct the first ever Indonesian
    corpora for chat summarization. Specifically, we utilized documents of multi-participant
    chat from a well known online instant messaging application, WhatsApp. We construct
    the gold standard by asking three native speakers to manually summarize 300 chat
    sections (152 of them contain images). As result, three reference summaries in
    extractive and either abstractive form are produced for each chat sections. The
    corpus is still in its early stage of investigation, yielding exciting possibilities
    of future works.

  abstract: "Evaluation of text summarization approaches have been mostly based on\
    \ metrics that measure similarities of system generated summaries with a set of\
    \ human written gold-standard summaries. The most widely used metric in summarization\
    \ evaluation has been the ROUGE family. ROUGE solely relies on lexical overlaps\
    \ between the terms and phrases in the sentences; therefore, in cases of terminology\
    \ variations and paraphrasing, ROUGE is not as effective. Scientific article summarization\
    \ is one such case that is different from general domain summarization (e.g. newswire\
    \ data). We provide an extensive analysis of ROUGE\u2019s effectiveness as an\
    \ evaluation metric for scientific summarization; we show that, contrary to the\
    \ common belief, ROUGE is not much reliable in evaluating scientific summaries.\
    \ We furthermore show how different variants of ROUGE result in very different\
    \ correlations with the manual Pyramid scores. Finally, we propose an alternative\
    \ metric for summarization evaluation which is based on the content relevance\
    \ between a system generated summary and the corresponding human written summaries.\
    \ We call our metric SERA (Summarization Evaluation by Relevance Analysis). Unlike\
    \ ROUGE, SERA consistently achieves high correlations with manual scores which\
    \ shows its effectiveness in evaluation of scientific article summarization."

  abstract: WordNet represents a cornerstone in the Computational Linguistics field,
    linking words to meanings (or senses) through a taxonomical representation of
    synsets, i.e., clusters of words with an equivalent meaning in a specific context
    often described by few definitions (or glosses) and examples. Most of the approaches
    to the Word Sense Disambiguation task fully rely on these short texts as a source
    of contextual information to match with the input text to disambiguate. This paper
    presents the first attempt to enrich synsets data with common-sense definitions,
    automatically retrieved from ConceptNet 5, and disambiguated accordingly to WordNet.
    The aim was to exploit the shared- and immediate-thinking nature of common-sense
    knowledge to extend the short but incredibly useful contextual information of
    the synsets. A manual evaluation on a subset of the entire result (which counts
    a total of almost 600K synset enrichments) shows a very high precision with an
    estimated good recall.

    \ of the German lexical substitution data set used at the GermEval 2015: LexSub\
    \ shared task. Using the two annotation layers, we conduct the first known empirical\
    \ study of the relationship between manually applied word senses and lexical substitutions.\
    \ We find that synonymy and hypernymy/hyponymy are the only semantic relations\
    \ directly linking targets to their substitutes, and that substitutes in the target\u2019\
    s hypernymy/hyponymy taxonomy closely align with the synonyms of a single GermaNet\
    \ synset. Despite this, these substitutes account for a minority of those provided\
    \ by the annotators. The results of our analysis accord with those of a previous\
    \ study on English-language data (albeit with automatically induced word senses),\
    \ leading us to suspect that the sense\u2015substitution relations we discovered\
    \ may be of a universal nature. We also tentatively conclude that relatively cheap\
    \ lexical substitution annotations can be used as a knowledge source for automatic\
    \ WSD. Also introduced in this paper is Ubyline, the web application used to produce\
    \ the sense annotations. Ubyline presents an intuitive user interface optimized\
    \ for annotating lexical sample data, and is readily adaptable to sense inventories\
    \ other than GermaNet."

  abstract: We present an annotation study on a representative dataset of literal
    and idiomatic uses of German infinitive-verb compounds in newspaper and journal
    texts. Infinitive-verb compounds form a challenge for writers of German, because
    spelling regulations are different for literal and idiomatic uses. Through the
    participation of expert lexicographers we were able to obtain a high-quality corpus
    resource which offers itself as a testbed for automatic idiomaticity detection
    and coarse-grained word-sense disambiguation. We trained a classifier on the corpus
    which was able to distinguish literal and idiomatic uses with an accuracy of 85
    %.

  abstract: 'We launch the SemDaX corpus which is a recently completed Danish human-annotated
    corpus available through a CLARIN academic license. The corpus includes approx.
    90,000 words, comprises six textual domains, and is annotated with sense inventories
    of different granularity. The aim of the developed corpus is twofold: i) to assess
    the reliability of the different sense annotation schemes for Danish measured
    by qualitative analyses and annotation agreement scores, and ii) to serve as training
    and test data for machine learning algorithms with the practical purpose of developing
    sense taggers for Danish. To these aims, we take a new approach to human-annotated
    corpus resources by double annotating a much larger part of the corpus than what
    is normally seen: for the all-words task we double annotated 60% of the material
    and for the lexical sample task 100%. We include in the corpus not only the adjucated
    files, but also the diverging annotations. In other words, we consider not all
    disagreement to be noise, but rather to contain valuable linguistic information
    that can help us improve our annotation schemes and our learning algorithms.'

  abstract: We present a pilot analysis of a new linguistic resource, VPS-GradeUp
    (available at http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1585). The resource contains 11,400
    graded human decisions on usage patterns of 29 English lexical verbs, randomly
    selected from the Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs (Hanks, 2000 2014) based
    on their frequency and the number of senses their lemmas have in PDEV. This data
    set has been created to observe the interannotator agreement on PDEV patterns
    produced using the Corpus Pattern Analysis (Hanks, 2013). Apart from the graded
    decisions, the data set also contains traditional Word-Sense-Disambiguation (WSD)
    labels. We analyze the associations between the graded annotation and WSD annotation.
    The results of the respective annotations do not correlate with the size of the
    usage pattern inventory for the respective verbs lemmas, which makes the data
    set worth further linguistic analysis.

  abstract: Chinese sentences are written as sequences of characters, which are elementary
    units of syntax and semantics. Characters are highly polysemous in forming words.
    We present a position-sensitive skip-gram model to learn multi-prototype Chinese
    character embeddings, and explore the usefulness of such character embeddings
    to Chinese NLP tasks. Evaluation on character similarity shows that multi-prototype
    embeddings are significantly better than a single-prototype baseline. In addition,
    used as features in the Chinese NER task, the embeddings result in a 1.74% F-score
    improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

  abstract: Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) is the task of linking a named-entity
    mention to an instance in a knowledge-base, typically Wikipedia-derived resources
    like DBpedia. This task is closely related to word-sense disambiguation (WSD),
    where the mention of an open-class word is linked to a concept in a knowledge-base,
    typically WordNet. This paper analyzes the relation between two annotated datasets
    on NED and WSD, highlighting the commonalities and differences. We detail the
    methods to construct a NED system following the WSD word-expert approach, where
    we need a dictionary and one classifier is built for each target entity mention
    string. Constructing a dictionary for NED proved challenging, and although similarity
    and ambiguity are higher for NED, the results are also higher due to the larger
    number of training data, and the more crisp and skewed meaning differences.

    \ addressed in this paper. Two \u2018massive\u2019 experiments are reported: in\
    \ the first one, the original EN-ES translation set was removed from the Apertium\

    \ the previously removed EN-ES data and against the Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary.\
    \ In the second experiment, a new non-existent EN-FR translation set was generated.\
    \ In this case the results were compared against a converted wiktionary English-French\
    \ file. The results we got are really good and perform well for the extreme case\
    \ of correlated polysemy. This lead us to address the possibility to use cycles\
    \ and nodes degree to identify potential oddities in the source data. If cycle\

  abstract: The development of standard models for describing general lexical resources
    has led to the emergence of numerous lexical datasets of various languages in
    the Semantic Web. However, equivalent models covering the linguistic domain of
    morphology do not exist. As a result, there are hardly any language resources
    of morphemic data available in RDF to date. This paper presents the creation of
    the Hebrew Morpheme Inventory from a manually compiled tabular dataset comprising
    around 52.000 entries. It is an ongoing effort of representing the lexemes, word-forms
    and morphologigal patterns together with their underlying relations based on the
    newly created Multilingual Morpheme Ontology (MMoOn). It will be shown how segmented
    Hebrew language data can be granularly described in a Linked Data format, thus,
    serving as an exemplary case for creating morpheme inventories of any inflectional
    language with MMoOn. The resulting dataset is described a) according to the structure
    of the underlying data format, b) with respect to the Hebrew language characteristic
    of building word-forms directly from roots, c) by exemplifying how inflectional

  abstract: We present a new collection of multilingual corpora automatically created
    from the content available in the Global Voices websites, where volunteers have
    been posting and translating citizen media stories since 2004. We describe how
    we crawled and processed this content to generate parallel resources comprising
    302.6K document pairs and 8.36M segment alignments in 756 language pairs. For
    some language pairs, the segment alignments in this resource are the first open
    examples of their kind. In an initial use of this resource, we discuss how a set
    of document pair detection algorithms performs on the Greek-English corpus.

  abstract: High accuracy for automated translation and information retrieval calls
    for linguistic annotations at various language levels. The plethora of informal
    internet content sparked the demand for porting state-of-art natural language
    processing (NLP) applications to new social media as well as diverse language
    adaptation. Effort launched by the BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation)
    program at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) successfully addressed
    the internet information with enhanced NLP systems. BOLT aims for automated translation
    and linguistic analysis for informal genres of text and speech in online and in-person
    communication. As a part of this program, the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)
    developed valuable linguistic resources in support of the training and evaluation
    of such new technologies. This paper focuses on methodologies, infrastructure,
    and procedure for developing linguistic annotation at various language levels,
    including Treebank (TB), word alignment (WA), PropBank (PB), and co-reference
    (CoRef). Inspired by the OntoNotes approach with adaptations to the tasks to reflect
    the goals and scope of the BOLT project, this effort has introduced more annotation
    types of informal and free-style genres in English, Chinese and Egyptian Arabic.
    The corpus produced is by far the largest multi-lingual, multi-level and multi-genre
    annotation corpus of informal text and speech.

  abstract: Large Web corpora containing full documents with permissive licenses are
    crucial for many NLP tasks. In this article we present the construction of 12
    million-pages Web corpus (over 10 billion tokens) licensed under CreativeCommons
    license family in 50+ languages that has been extracted from CommonCrawl, the
    largest publicly available general Web crawl to date with about 2 billion crawled
    URLs. Our highly-scalable Hadoop-based framework is able to process the full CommonCrawl
    corpus on 2000+ CPU cluster on the Amazon Elastic Map/Reduce infrastructure. The
    processing pipeline includes license identification, state-of-the-art boilerplate
    removal, exact duplicate and near-duplicate document removal, and language detection.
    The construction of the corpus is highly configurable and fully reproducible,
    and we provide both the framework (DKPro C4CorpusTools) and the resulting data
    (C4Corpus) to the research community.

  abstract: This paper introduces LexFr, a corpus-based French lexical resource built
    by adapting the framework LexIt, originally developed to describe the combinatorial
    potential of Italian predicates. As in the original framework, the behavior of
    a group of target predicates is characterized by a series of syntactic (i.e.,
    subcategorization frames) and semantic (i.e., selectional preferences) statistical
    information (a.k.a. distributional profiles) whose extraction process is mostly
    unsupervised. The first release of LexFr includes information for 2,493 verbs,
    7,939 nouns and 2,628 adjectives. In these pages we describe the adaptation process
    and evaluated the final resource by comparing the information collected for 20
    test verbs against the information available in a gold standard dictionary. In
    the best performing setting, we obtained 0.74 precision, 0.66 recall and 0.70
    F-measure.

  abstract: 'Polarity lexicons are a basic resource for analyzing the sentiments and
    opinions expressed in texts in an automated way. This paper explores three methods
    to construct polarity lexicons: translating existing lexicons from other languages,
    extracting polarity lexicons from corpora, and annotating sentiments Lexical Knowledge
    Bases. Each of these methods require a different degree of human effort. We evaluate
    how much manual effort is needed and to what extent that effort pays in terms
    of performance improvement. Experiment setup includes generating lexicons for
    Basque, and evaluating them against gold standard datasets in different domains.
    Results show that extracting polarity lexicons from corpora is the best solution
    for achieving a good performance with reasonable human effort.'

  abstract: In this work we introduce and describe a language resource composed of
    lists of simpler synonyms for Spanish. The synonyms are divided in different senses
    taken from the Spanish OpenThesaurus, where context disambiguation was performed
    by using statistical information from the Web and Google Books Ngrams. This resource
    is freely available online and can be used for different NLP tasks such as lexical
    simplification. Indeed, so far it has been already integrated into four tools.

  abstract: A trend to digitize historical paper-based archives has emerged in recent
    years, with the advent of digital optical scanners. A lot of paper-based books,
    textbooks, magazines, articles, and documents are being transformed into electronic
    versions that can be manipulated by a computer. For this purpose, Optical Character
    Recognition (OCR) systems have been developed to transform scanned digital text
    into editable computer text. However, different kinds of errors in the OCR system
    output text can be found, but Automatic Error Correction tools can help in performing
    the quality of electronic texts by cleaning and removing noises. In this paper,
    we perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of several error-correction
    techniques for historical French documents. Experimentation shows that our Machine
    Translation for Error Correction method is superior to other Language Modelling

  abstract: We present further work on evaluation of the fully automatic post-correction
    of Early Dutch Books Online, a collection of 10,333 18th century books. In prior
    work we evaluated the new implementation of Text-Induced Corpus Clean-up (TICCL)
    on the basis of a single book Gold Standard derived from this collection. In the
    current paper we revisit the same collection on the basis of a sizeable 1020 item
    random sample of OCR post-corrected strings from the full collection. Both evaluations
    have their own stories to tell and lessons to teach.

  abstract: Crowdsourcing approaches for post-correction of OCR output (Optical Character
    Recognition) have been successfully applied to several historic text collections.
    We report on our crowd-correction platform Kokos, which we built to improve the
    OCR quality of the digitized yearbooks of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from the
    19th century. This multilingual heritage corpus consists of Alpine texts mainly
    written in German and French, all typeset in Antiqua font. Finding and engaging
    volunteers for correcting large amounts of pages into high quality text requires
    a carefully designed user interface, an easy-to-use workflow, and continuous efforts
    for keeping the participants motivated. More than 180,000 characters on about
    21,000 pages were corrected by volunteers in about 7 month, achieving an OCR gold
    standard with a systematically evaluated accuracy of 99.7% on the word level.
    The crowdsourced OCR gold standard and the corresponding original OCR recognition
    results from Abby FineReader 7 for each page are available as a resource. Additionally,
    the scanned images (300dpi) of all pages are included in order to facilitate tests
    with other OCR software.

  abstract: 'Given a controversial issue, argument mining from natural language texts
    (news papers, and any form of text on the Internet) is extremely challenging:
    domain knowledge is often required together with appropriate forms of inferences
    to identify arguments. This contribution explores the types of knowledge that
    are required and how they can be paired with reasoning schemes, language processing
    and language resources to accurately mine arguments. We show via corpus analysis
    that the Generative Lexicon, enhanced in different manners and viewed as both
    a lexicon and a domain knowledge representation, is a relevant approach. In this
    paper, corpus annotation for argument mining is first developed, then we show
    how the generative lexicon approach must be adapted and how it can be paired with
    language processing patterns to extract and specify the nature of arguments. Our
    approach to argument mining is thus knowledge driven.'

  abstract: In the present paper, we analyse variation of discourse phenomena in two
    typologically different languages, i.e. in German and Czech. The novelty of our
    approach lies in the nature of the resources we are using. Advantage is taken
    of existing resources, which are, however, annotated on the basis of two different
    frameworks. We use an interoperable scheme unifying discourse phenomena in both
    frameworks into more abstract categories and considering only those phenomena
    that have a direct match in German and Czech. The discourse properties we focus
    on are relations of identity, semantic similarity, ellipsis and discourse relations.
    Our study shows that the application of interoperable schemes allows an exploitation
    of discourse-related phenomena analysed in different projects and on the basis
    of different frameworks. As corpus compilation and annotation is a time-consuming
    task, positive results of this experiment open up new paths for contrastive linguistics,
    translation studies and NLP, including machine translation.

  abstract: In sources used in oral history research (such as interviews with eye
    witnesses), passages where the degree of personal emotional involvement is found
    to be high can be of particular interest, as these may give insight into how historical
    events were experienced, and what moral dilemmas and psychological or religious
    struggles were encountered. In a pilot study involving a large corpus of interview
    recordings with Dutch war veterans, we have investigated if it is possible to
    develop a method for automatically identifying those passages where the degree
    of personal emotional involvement is high. The method is based on the automatic
    detection of exceptionally large silences and filled pause segments (using Automatic
    Speech Recognition), and cues taken from specific n-grams. The first results appear
    to be encouraging enough for further elaboration of the method.

  abstract: Existing discourse research only focuses on the monolingual languages
    and the inconsistency between languages limits the power of the discourse theory
    in multilingual applications such as machine translation. To address this issue,
    we design and build a bilingual discource corpus in which we are currently defining
    and annotating the bilingual elementary discourse units (BEDUs). The BEDUs are
    then organized into hierarchical structures. Using this discourse style, we have
    annotated nearly 20K LDC sentences. Finally, we design a bilingual discourse based
    method for machine translation evaluation and show the effectiveness of our bilingual
    discourse annotations.

  abstract: DiMLex is a lexicon of German connectives that can be used for various
    language understanding purposes. We enhanced the coverage to 275 connectives,
    which we regard as covering all known German discourse connectives in current
    use. In this paper, we consider the task of adding the semantic relations that
    can be expressed by each connective. After discussing different approaches to
    retrieving semantic information, we settle on annotating each connective with
    senses from the new PDTB 3.0 sense hierarchy. We describe our new implementation
    in the extended DiMLex, which will be available for research purposes.

  abstract: Dispute mediation is a growing activity in the resolution of conflicts,
    and more and more research emerge to enhance and better understand this (until
    recently) understudied practice. Corpus analyses are necessary to study discourse
    in this context; yet, little data is available, mainly because of its confidentiality
    principle. After proposing hints and avenues to acquire transcripts of mediation
    sessions, this paper presents the Dispute Mediation Corpus, which gathers annotated
    excerpts of mediation dialogues. Although developed as part of a project on argumentation,
    it is freely available and the text data can be used by anyone. This first-ever
    open corpus of mediation interactions can be of interest to scholars studying
    discourse, but also conflict resolution, argumentation, linguistics, communication,
    etc. We advocate for using and extending this resource that may be valuable to
    a large variety of domains of research, particularly those striving to enhance
    the study of the rapidly growing activity of dispute mediation.

  abstract: This paper presents the creation of a corpus of labeled disabilities in
    scientific papers. The identification of medical concepts in documents and, especially,
    the identification of disabilities, is a complex task mainly due to the variety
    of expressions that can make reference to the same problem. Currently there is
    not a set of documents manually annotated with disabilities with which to evaluate
    an automatic detection system of such concepts. This is the reason why this corpus
    arises, aiming to facilitate the evaluation of systems that implement an automatic
    annotation tool for extracting biomedical concepts such as disabilities. The result
    is a set of scientific papers manually annotated. For the selection of these scientific
    papers has been conducted a search using a list of rare diseases, since they generally
    have associated several disabilities of different kinds.

    representation of the content of a story. We describe the topics of the stories
    and the basis of the Story Intention Graph representation, as well as the process
    of annotating the stories to produce the Story Intention Graphs and the challenges
    of adapting the tool to this new personal narrative domain. We also discuss how
    the corpus can be used in applications that retell the story using different styles
    of tellings, co-tellings, or as a content planner.

  abstract: This paper explores several aspects together for a fine-grained Chinese
    discourse analysis. We deal with the issues of ambiguous discourse markers, ambiguous
    marker linkings, and more than one discourse marker. A universal feature representation
    is proposed. The pair-once postulation, cross-discourse-unit-first rule and word-pair-marker-first
    rule select a set of discourse markers from ambiguous linkings. Marker-Sum feature
    considers total contribution of markers and Marker-Preference feature captures
    the probability distribution of discourse functions of a representative marker
    by using preference rule. The HIT Chinese discourse relation treebank (HIT-CDTB)
    is used to evaluate the proposed models. The 25-way classifier achieves 0.57 micro-averaged
    F-score.

  abstract: In discourse relation annotation, there is currently a variety of different
    frameworks being used, and most of them have been developed and employed mostly
    on written data. This raises a number of questions regarding interoperability
    of discourse relation annotation schemes, as well as regarding differences in
    discourse annotation for written vs. spoken domains. In this paper, we describe
    ouron annotating two spoken domains from the SPICE Ireland corpus (telephone conversations
    and broadcast interviews) according todifferent discourse annotation schemes,
    PDTB 3.0 and CCR. We show that annotations in the two schemes can largely be mappedone
    another, and discuss differences in operationalisations of discourse relation
    schemes which present a challenge to automatic mapping. We also observe systematic
    differences in the prevalence of implicit discourse relations in spoken data compared
    to written texts,find that there are also differences in the types of causal relations
    between the domains. Finally, we find that PDTB 3.0 addresses many shortcomings
    of PDTB 2.0 wrt. the annotation of spoken discourse, and suggest further extensions.
    The new corpus has roughly theof the CoNLL 2015 Shared Task test set, and we hence
    hope that it will be a valuable resource for the evaluation of automatic discourse
    relation labellers.

    the size of the corpus with manual transcriptions from a new operational day;
    secondly we have added new linguistic annotations to the whole corpus (either
    manually or through an automatic processing) in order to perform various linguistic

  abstract: We present the first corpus of texts annotated with two alternative approaches
    to discourse structure, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988)
    and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). 112
    short argumentative texts have been analyzed according to these two theories.
    Furthermore, in previous work, the same texts have already been annotated for
    their argumentation structure, according to the scheme of Peldszus and Stede (2013).
    This corpus therefore enables studies of correlations between the two accounts
    of discourse structure, and between discourse and argumentation. We converted
    the three annotation formats to a common dependency tree format that enables to
    compare the structures, and we describe some initial findings.

  abstract: We propose a scheme for annotating direct speech in literary texts, based
    on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and the coreference annotation guidelines
    from the Message Understanding Conference (MUC). The scheme encodes the speakers
    and listeners of utterances in a text, as well as the quotative verbs that reports
    the utterances. We measure inter-annotator agreement on this annotation task.
    We then present statistics on a manually annotated corpus that consists of books
    from the New Testament. Finally, we visualize the corpus as a conversational network.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a method for the normalization of historical texts
    using a combination of weighted finite-state transducers and language models.
    We have extended our previous work on the normalization of dialectal texts and
    tested the method against a 17th century literary work in Basque. This preprocessed
    corpus is made available in the LREC repository. The performance of this method
    for learning relations between historical and contemporary word forms is evaluated
    against resources in three languages. The method we present learns to map phonological
    changes using a noisy channel model. The model is based on techniques commonly
    used for phonological inference and producing Grapheme-to-Grapheme conversion
    systems encoded as weighted transducers and produces F-scores above 80% in the
    task for Basque. A wider evaluation shows that the approach performs equally well
    with all the languages in our evaluation suite: Basque, Spanish and Slovene. A
    comparison against other methods that address the same task is also provided.'

    suffixes, and their combination; presence in lexicons containing valid stems and
    named entities; and underlying stem templates. Farasa outperforms or equalizes
    state-of-the-art Arabic segmenters, namely QATARA and MADAMIRA. Meanwhile, Farasa
    is nearly one order of magnitude faster than QATARA and two orders of magnitude
    faster than MADAMIRA. The segmenter should be able to process one billion words
    in less than 5 hours. Farasa is written entirely in native Java, with no external
    dependencies, and is open-source.'

  abstract: This paper discusses the internal structure of complex Esperanto words
    (CWs). Using a morphological analyzer, possible affixation and compounding is
    checked for over 50,000 Esperanto lexemes against a list of 17,000 root words.
    Morpheme boundaries in the resulting analyses were then checked manually, creating
    a CW dictionary of 28,000 words, representing 56.4% of the lexicon, or 19.4% of
    corpus tokens. The error percentage of the EspGram morphological analyzer for
    new corpus CWs was 4.3% for types and 6.4% for tokens, with a recall of almost
    100%, and wrong/spurious boundaries being more common than missing ones. For pedagogical
    purposes a morpheme frequency dictionary was constructed for a 16 million word
    corpus, confirming the importance of agglutinative derivational morphemes in the
    Esperanto lexicon. Finally, as a means to reduce the morphological ambiguity of
    CWs, we provide POS likelihoods for Esperanto suffixes.

  abstract: 'Vietnamese word segmentation (VWS) is a challenging basic issue for natural
    language processing. This paper addresses the problem of how does dictionary size
    influence VWS performance, proposes two novel measures: square overlap ratio (SOR)
    and relaxed square overlap ratio (RSOR), and validates their effectiveness. The
    SOR measure is the product of dictionary overlap ratio and corpus overlap ratio,
    and the RSOR measure is the relaxed version of SOR measure under an unsupervised
    condition. The two measures both indicate the suitable degree between segmentation
    dictionary and object corpus waiting for segmentation. The experimental results
    show that the more suitable, neither smaller nor larger, dictionary size is better
    to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for dictionary-based Vietnamese word
    segmenters.'

  abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses serious challenges for Natural Language Processing
    (NLP). The number and sophistication of tools and datasets in DA are very limited
    in comparison to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and other languages. MSA tools do
    not effectively model DA which makes the direct use of MSA NLP tools for handling
    dialects impractical. This is particularly a challenge for the creation of tools
    to support learning Arabic as a living language on the web, where authentic material
    can be found in both MSA and DA. In this paper, we present the Dialectal Arabic
    Linguistic Learning Assistant (DALILA), a Chrome extension that utilizes cutting-edge
    Arabic dialect NLP research to assist learners and non-native speakers in understanding
    text written in either MSA or DA. DALILA provides dialectal word analysis and

  abstract: "The CELEX database is one of the standard lexical resources for German.\
    \ It yields a wealth of data especially for phonological and morphological applications.\
    \ The morphological part comprises deep-structure morphological analyses of German.\
    \ However, as it was developed in the Nineties, both encoding and spelling are\
    \ outdated. About one fifth of over 50,000 datasets contain umlauts and signs\
    \ such as \xDF. Changes to a modern version cannot be obtained by simple substitution.\
    \ In this paper, we shortly describe the original content and form of the orthographic\
    \ and morphological database for German in CELEX. Then we present our work on\
    \ modernizing the linguistic data. Lemmas and morphological analyses are transferred\
    \ to a modern standard of encoding by first merging orthographic and morphological\
    \ information of the lemmas and their entries and then performing a second substitution\
    \ for the morphs within their morphological analyses. Changes to modern German\
    \ spelling are performed by substitution rules according to orthographical standards.\
    \ We show an example of the use of the data for the disambiguation of morphological\
    \ structures. The discussion describes prospects of future work on this or similar\
    \ lexicons. The Perl script is publicly available on our website."

  abstract: "We propose an automatic approach towards determining the relative location\
    \ of adjectives on a common scale based on their strength. We focus on adjectives\
    \ expressing different degrees of goodness occurring in French product (perfumes)\
    \ reviews. Using morphosyntactic patterns, we extract from the reviews short phrases\
    \ consisting of a noun that encodes a particular aspect of the perfume and an\
    \ adjective modifying that noun. We then associate each such n-gram with the corresponding\
    \ product aspect and its related star rating. Next, based on the star scores,\
    \ we generate adjective scales reflecting the relative strength of specific adjectives\
    \ associated with a shared attribute of the product. An automatic ordering of\
    \ the adjectives \u201Ccorrect\u201D (correct), \u201Csympa\u201D (nice), \u201C\
    bon\u201D (good) and \u201Cexcellent\u201D (excellent) according to their score\
    \ in our resource is consistent with an intuitive scale based on human judgments.\
    \ Our long-term objective is to generate different adjective scales in an empirical\
    \ manner, which could allow the enrichment of lexical resources."

  abstract: The automatic analysis of texts containing opinions of users about, e.g.,
    products or political views has gained attention within the last decades. However,
    previous work on the task of analyzing user reviews about mobile applications
    in app stores is limited. Publicly available corpora do not exist, such that a
    comparison of different methods and models is difficult. We fill this gap by contributing
    the Sentiment Corpus of App Reviews (SCARE), which contains fine-grained annotations
    of application aspects, subjective (evaluative) phrases and relations between
    both. This corpus consists of 1,760 annotated application reviews from the Google
    Play Store with 2,487 aspects and 3,959 subjective phrases. We describe the process
    and methodology how the corpus was created. The Fleiss Kappa between four annotators
    reveals an agreement of 0.72. We provide a strong baseline with a linear-chain
    conditional random field and word-embedding features with a performance of 0.62
    for aspect detection and 0.63 for the extraction of subjective phrases. The corpus
    is available to the research community to support the development of sentiment
    analysis methods on mobile application reviews.

  abstract: 'In this article we describe our method of automatically expanding an
    existing lexicon of words with affective valence scores. The automatic expansion
    process was done in English. In addition, we describe our procedure for automatically
    creating lexicons in languages where such resources may not previously exist.
    The foreign languages we discuss in this paper are Spanish, Russian and Farsi.
    We also describe the procedures to systematically validate our newly created resources.
    The main contributions of this work are: 1) A general method for expansion and
    creation of lexicons with scores of words on psychological constructs such as
    valence, arousal or dominance; and 2) a procedure for ensuring validity of the
    newly constructed resources.'

    \ Various inter-annotator agreement studies, which were carried out at different\

    \ in microblogs is an inherently difficult task even for professional coders.\
    \ These difficulties, however, can be alleviated by letting the annotators revise\
    \ each other\u2019s decisions. Once rechecked, the experts can proceed with the\

  abstract: This paper discusses the challenges in carrying out fair comparative evaluations
    of sentiment analysis systems. Firstly, these are due to differences in corpus
    annotation guidelines and sentiment class distribution. Secondly, different systems
    often make different assumptions about how to interpret certain statements, e.g.
    tweets with URLs. In order to study the impact of these on evaluation results,
    this paper focuses on tweet sentiment analysis in particular. One existing and
    two newly created corpora are used, and the performance of four different sentiment
    analysis systems is reported; we make our annotated datasets and sentiment analysis
    applications publicly available. We see considerable variations in results across
    the different corpora, which calls into question the validity of many existing
    annotated datasets and evaluations, and we make some observations about both the
    systems and the datasets as a result.

    tweets annotated with 28 emotion categories for the purpose of training and evaluating
    machine learning models for emotion classification. EmoTweet-28 is, to date, the
    largest tweet corpus annotated with fine-grained emotion categories. The corpus
    contains annotations for four facets of emotion: valence, arousal, emotion category
    and emotion cues. We first used small-scale content analysis to inductively identify
    a set of emotion categories that characterize the emotions expressed in microblog
    text. We then expanded the size of the corpus using crowdsourcing. The corpus
    encompasses a variety of examples including explicit and implicit expressions
    of emotions as well as tweets containing multiple emotions. EmoTweet-28 represents
    an important resource to advance the development and evaluation of more emotion-sensitive
    systems.'

    \ for the adaptation and integration in the environment, offering, most of the\
    \ time together with the cognitive system, the appropriate responses to stimuli\
    \ in the environment. As such, they are an important component in decision-making\
    \ processes. In today\u2019s society, the avalanche of stimuli present in the\

  abstract: 'The paper describes the new Russian sentiment lexicon - RuSentiLex. The
    lexicon was gathered from several sources: opinionated words from domain-oriented
    Russian sentiment vocabularies, slang and curse words extracted from Twitter,
    objective words with positive or negative connotations from a news collection.
    The words in the lexicon having different sentiment orientations in specific senses
    are linked to appropriate concepts of the thesaurus of Russian language RuThes.
    All lexicon entries are classified according to four sentiment categories and
    three sources of sentiment (opinion, emotion, or fact). The lexicon can serve
    as the first version for the construction of domain-specific sentiment lexicons
    or can be used for feature generation in machine-learning approaches. In this
    role, the RuSentiLex lexicon was utilized by the participants of the SentiRuEval-2016
    Twitter reputation monitoring shared task and allowed them to achieve high results.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a framework and methodology for the annotation of
    perspectives in text. In the last decade, different aspects of linguistic encoding
    of perspectives have been targeted as separated phenomena through different annotation
    initiatives. We propose an annotation scheme that integrates these different phenomena.
    We use a multilayered annotation approach, splitting the annotation of different
    aspects of perspectives into small subsequent subtasks in order to reduce the
    complexity of the task and to better monitor interactions between layers. Currently,
    we have included four layers of perspective annotation: events, attribution, factuality
    and opinion. The annotations are integrated in a formal model called GRaSP, which
    provides the means to represent instances (e.g. events, entities) and propositions
    in the (real or assumed) world in relation to their mentions in text. Then, the
    relation between the source and target of a perspective is characterized by means
    of perspective annotations. This enables us to place alternative perspectives
    on the same entity, event or proposition next to each other.'

  abstract: 'With the explosive growth of online social media (forums, blogs, and
    social networks), exploitation of these new information sources has become essential.
    Our work is based on the sud4science project. The goal of this project is to perform
    multidisciplinary work on a corpus of authentic SMS, in French, collected in 2011
    and anonymised (88milSMS corpus: http://88milsms.huma-num.fr). This paper highlights
    a new method to integrate opinion detection knowledge from an SMS corpus by combining
    lexical and semantic information. More precisely, our approach gives more weight
    to words with a sentiment (i.e. presence of words in a dedicated dictionary) for
    a classification task based on three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.
    The experiments were conducted on two corpora: an elongated SMS corpus (i.e. repetitions
    of characters in messages) and a non-elongated SMS corpus. We noted that non-elongated
    SMS were much better classified than elongated SMS. Overall, this study highlighted
    that the integration of semantic knowledge always improves classification.'

  abstract: This paper presents some experiments for specialising Paragraph Vectors,
    a new technique for creating text fragment (phrase, sentence, paragraph, text,
    ...) embedding vectors, for text polarity detection. The first extension regards
    the injection of polarity information extracted from a polarity lexicon into embeddings
    and the second extension aimed at inserting word order information into Paragraph
    Vectors. These two extensions, when training a logistic-regression classifier
    on the combined embeddings, were able to produce a relevant gain in performance
    when compared to the standard Paragraph Vector methods proposed by Le and Mikolov
    (2014).

  abstract: In this article, we propose to evaluate the lexical similarity information
    provided by word representations against several opinion resources using traditional
    Information Retrieval tools. Word representation have been used to build and to
    extend opinion resources such as lexicon, and ontology and their performance have
    been evaluated on sentiment analysis tasks. We question this method by measuring
    the correlation between the sentiment proximity provided by opinion resources
    and the semantic similarity provided by word representations using different correlation
    coefficients. We also compare the neighbors found in word representations and
    list of similar opinion words. Our results show that the proximity of words in
    state-of-the-art word representations is not very effective to build sentiment
    similarity.

  abstract: Vector space models and distributional information are widely used in
    NLP. The models typically rely on complex, high-dimensional objects. We present
    an interactive visualisation tool to explore salient lexical-semantic features
    of high-dimensional word objects and word similarities. Most visualisation tools
    provide only one low-dimensional map of the underlying data, so they are not capable
    of retaining the local and the global structure. We overcome this limitation by
    providing an additional trust-view to obtain a more realistic picture of the actual
    object distances. Additional tool options include the reference to a gold standard
    classification, the reference to a cluster analysis as well as listing the most
    salient (common) features for a selected subset of the words.

  abstract: This paper introduces a ruled-based method and software tool, called SemAligner,
    for aligning chunks across texts in a given pair of short English texts. The tool,
    based on the top performing method at the Interpretable Short Text Similarity
    shared task at SemEval 2015, where it was used with human annotated (gold) chunks,
    can now additionally process plain text-pairs using two powerful chunkers we developed,
    e.g. using Conditional Random Fields. Besides aligning chunks, the tool automatically
    assigns semantic relations to the aligned chunks (such as EQUI for equivalent
    and OPPO for opposite) and semantic similarity scores that measure the strength
    of the semantic relation between the aligned chunks. Experiments show that SemAligner
    performs competitively for system generated chunks and that these results are
    also comparable to results obtained on gold chunks. SemAligner has other capabilities
    such as handling various input formats and chunkers as well as extending lookup
    resources.

    cosine distance between the MWE vector and the composition of the vectors of its
    member words. Our generic system can handle several types of word embeddings and
    MWE lists, and may combine individual word representations using several composition
    techniques. We evaluate our implementation on a dataset of 1042 English noun compounds,
    comparing different configurations of the underlying word embeddings and word-composition
    models. We show that our vector-based scores model non-compositionality better

  abstract: Although meaning is at the core of human cognition, state-of-the-art distributional
    semantic models (DSMs) are often agnostic to the findings in the area of semantic
    cognition. In this work, we present a novel type of DSMs motivated by the dual-processing
    cognitive perspective that is triggered by lexico-semantic activations in the
    short-term human memory. The proposed model is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art
    models for computing semantic similarity between words. The fusion of different
    types of DSMs is also investigated achieving results that are comparable or better
    than the state-of-the-art. The used corpora along with a set of tools, as well
    as large repositories of vectorial word representations are made publicly available
    for four languages (English, German, Italian, and Greek).

  abstract: We describe resources aimed at increasing the usability of the semantic
    representations utilized within the DELPH-IN (Deep Linguistic Processing with
    HPSG) consortium. We concentrate in particular on the Dependency Minimal Recursion
    Semantics (DMRS) formalism, a graph-based representation designed for compositional
    semantic representation with deep grammars. Our main focus is on English, and
    specifically English Resource Semantics (ERS) as used in the English Resource
    Grammar. We first give an introduction to ERS and DMRS and a brief overview of
    some existing resources and then describe in detail a new repository which has
    been developed to simplify the use of ERS/DMRS. We explain a number of operations
    on DMRS graphs which our repository supports, with sketches of the algorithms,
    and illustrate how these operations can be exploited in application building.
    We believe that this work will aid researchers to exploit the rich and effective
    but complex DELPH-IN resources.

  abstract: "How-knowledge is indispensable in daily life, but has relatively less\
    \ quantity and poorer quality than what-knowledge in publicly available knowledge\
    \ bases. This paper first extracts task-subtask pairs from wikiHow, then mines\
    \ linguistic patterns from search query logs, and finally applies the mined patterns\
    \ to extract subtasks to complete given how-to tasks. To evaluate the proposed\
    \ methodology, we group tasks and the corresponding recommended subtasks into\
    \ pairs, and evaluate the results automatically and manually. The automatic evaluation\
    \ shows the accuracy of 0.4494. We also classify the mined patterns based on prepositions\
    \ and find that the prepositions like \u201Con\u201D, \u201Cto\u201D, and \u201C\
    with\u201D have the better performance. The results can be used to accelerate\

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a novel application of compositional distributional
    semantic models (CDSMs): prediction of lexical typology. The paper introduces
    the notion of typological closeness, which is a novel rigorous formalization of
    semantic similarity based on comparison of multilingual data. Starting from the
    Moscow Database of Qualitative Features for adjective typology, we create four
    datasets of typological closeness, on which we test a range of distributional
    semantic models. We show that, on the one hand, vector representations of phrases
    based on data from one language can be used to predict how words within the phrase
    translate into different languages, and, on the other hand, that typological data
    can serve as a semantic benchmark for distributional models. We find that compositional
    distributional models, especially parametric ones, perform way above non-compositional
    alternatives on the task.'

  abstract: 'The problem of understanding the stream of messages exchanged on social
    media such as Facebook and Twitter is becoming a major challenge for automated
    systems. The tremendous amount of data exchanged on these platforms as well as
    the specific form of language adopted by social media users constitute a new challenging
    context for existing argument mining techniques. In this paper, we describe a
    resource of natural language arguments called DART (Dataset of Arguments and their
    Relations on Twitter) where the complete argument mining pipeline over Twitter
    messages is considered: (i) we identify which tweets can be considered as arguments
    and which cannot, and (ii) we identify what is the relation, i.e., support or
    attack, linking such tweets to each other.'

  abstract: 'This paper introduces Port4NooJ v3.0, the latest version of the Portuguese
    module for NooJ, highlights its main features, and details its three main new
    components: (i) a lexicon-grammar based dictionary of 5,177 human intransitive
    adjectives, and a set of local grammars that use the distributional properties
    of those adjectives for paraphrasing (ii) a polarity dictionary with 9,031 entries
    for sentiment analysis, and (iii) a set of priority dictionaries and local grammars
    for named entity recognition. These new components were derived and/or adapted
    from publicly available resources. The Port4NooJ v3.0 resource is innovative in
    terms of the specificity of the linguistic knowledge it incorporates. The dictionary
    is bilingual Portuguese-English, and the semantico-syntactic information assigned
    to each entry validates the linguistic relation between the terms in both languages.
    These characteristics, which cannot be found in any other public resource for
    Portuguese, make it a valuable resource for translation and paraphrasing. The
    paper presents the current statistics and describes the different complementary
    and synergic components and integration efforts.'

  abstract: This paper describes corpora collection activity for building large machine
    translation systems for Latvian e-Government platform. We describe requirements
    for corpora, selection and assessment of data sources, collection of the public
    corpora and creation of new corpora from miscellaneous sources. Methodology, tools
    and assessment methods are also presented along with the results achieved, challenges
    faced and conclusions made. Several approaches to address the data scarceness
    are discussed. We summarize the volume of obtained corpora and provide quality
    metrics of MT systems trained on this data. Resulting MT systems for English-Latvian,
    Latvian English and Latvian Russian are integrated in the Latvian e-service portal
    and are freely available on website HUGO.LV. This paper can serve as a guidance
    for similar activities initiated in other countries, particularly in the context
    of European Language Resource Coordination action.

  abstract: 'In most of the research studies on Author Profiling, large quantities
    of correctly labeled data are used to train the models. However, this does not
    reflect the reality in forensic scenarios: in practical linguistic forensic investigations,
    the resources that are available to profile the author of a text are usually scarce.
    To pay tribute to this fact, we implemented a Semi-Supervised Learning variant
    of the k nearest neighbors algorithm that uses small sets of labeled data and
    a larger amount of unlabeled data to classify the authors of texts by gender (man
    vs woman). We describe the enriched KNN algorithm and show that the use of unlabeled
    instances improves the accuracy of our gender identification model. We also present
    a feature set that facilitates the use of a very small number of instances, reaching
    accuracies higher than 70% with only 113 instances to train the model. It is also
    shown that the algorithm also performs well using publicly available data.'

  abstract: Classifying research grants into useful categories is a vital task for
    a funding body to give structure to the portfolio for analysis, informing strategic
    planning and decision-making. Automating this classification process would save
    time and effort, providing the accuracy of the classifications is maintained.
    We employ five classification models to classify a set of BBSRC-funded research
    grants in 21 research topics based on unigrams, technical terms and Latent Dirichlet
    Allocation models. To boost precision, we investigate methods for combining their
    predictions into five aggregate classifiers. Evaluation confirmed that ensemble
    classification models lead to higher precision.It was observed that there is not
    a single best-performing aggregate method for all research topics. Instead, the
    best-performing method for a research topic depends on the number of positive
    training instances available for this topic. Subject matter experts considered
    the predictions of aggregate models to correct erroneous or incomplete manual
    assignments.

  abstract: The paper deals with merging two complementary resources of morphological
    data previously existing for Czech, namely the inflectional dictionary MorfFlex
    CZ and the recently developed lexical network DeriNet. The MorfFlex CZ dictionary
    has been used by a morphological analyzer capable of analyzing/generating several
    million Czech word forms according to the rules of Czech inflection. The DeriNet
    network contains several hundred thousand Czech lemmas interconnected with links
    corresponding to derivational relations (relations between base words and words
    derived from them). After summarizing basic characteristics of both resources,
    the process of merging is described, focusing on both rather technical aspects
    (growth of the data, measuring the quality of newly added derivational relations)
    and linguistic issues (treating lexical homonymy and vowel/consonant alternations).
    The resulting resource contains 970 thousand lemmas connected with 715 thousand
    derivational relations and is publicly available on the web under the CC-BY-NC-SA
    license. The data were incorporated in the MorphoDiTa library version 2.0 (which
    provides morphological analysis, generation, tagging and lemmatization for Czech)
    and can be browsed and searched by two web tools (DeriNet Viewer and DeriNet Search
    tool).

  abstract: The goal of a Hungarian research project has been to create an integrated
    Hungarian natural language processing framework. This infrastructure includes
    tools for analyzing Hungarian texts, integrated into a standardized environment.
    The morphological analyzer is one of the core components of the framework. The
    goal of this paper is to describe a fast and customizable morphological analyzer
    and its development framework, which synthesizes and further enriches the morphological
    knowledge implemented in previous tools existing for Hungarian. In addition, we
    present the method we applied to add semantic knowledge to the lexical database
    of the morphology. The method utilizes neural word embedding models and morphological
    and shallow syntactic knowledge.

  abstract: The Mixer series of speech corpora were collected over several years,
    principally to support annual NIST evaluations of speaker recognition (SR) technologies.
    These evaluations focused on conversational speech over a variety of channels
    and recording conditions. One of the series, Mixer-6, added a new condition, read
    speech, to support basic scientific research on speaker characteristics, as well
    as technology evaluation. With read speech it is possible to make relatively precise
    measurements of phonetic events and features, which can be correlated with the
    performance of speaker recognition algorithms, or directly used in phonetic analysis
    of speaker variability. The read speech, as originally recorded, was adequate
    for large-scale evaluations (e.g., fixed-text speaker ID algorithms) but only
    marginally suitable for acoustic-phonetic studies. Numerous errors due largely
    to speaker behavior remained in the corpus, with no record of their locations
    or rate of occurrence. We undertook the effort to correct this situation with
    automatic methods supplemented by human listening and annotation. The present
    paper describes the tools and methods, resulting corrections, and some examples
    of the kinds of research studies enabled by these enhancements.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe a new database with audio recordings of non-native
    (L2) speakers of English, and the perceptual evaluation experiment conducted with
    native English speakers for assessing the prosody of each recording. These annotations
    are then used to compute the gold standard using different methods, and a series
    of regression experiments is conducted to evaluate their impact on the performance
    of a regression model predicting the degree of naturalness of L2 speech. Further,
    we compare the relevance of different feature groups modelling prosody in general
    (without speech tempo), speech rate and pauses modelling speech tempo (fluency),
    voice quality, and a variety of spectral features. We also discuss the impact
    of various fusion strategies on performance.Overall, our results demonstrate that
    the prosody of non-native speakers of English as L2 can be reliably assessed using
    supra-segmental audio features; prosodic features seem to be the most important
    ones.

  abstract: The IFCASL corpus is a French-German bilingual phonetic learner corpus
    designed, recorded and annotated in a project on individualized feedback in computer-assisted
    spoken language learning. The motivation for setting up this corpus was that there
    is no phonetically annotated and segmented corpus for this language pair of comparable
    of size and coverage. In contrast to most learner corpora, the IFCASL corpus incorporate
    data for a language pair in both directions, i.e. in our case French learners
    of German, and German learners of French. In addition, the corpus is complemented
    by two sub-corpora of native speech by the same speakers. The corpus provides
    spoken data by about 100 speakers with comparable productions, annotated and segmented
    on the word and the phone level, with more than 50% manually corrected data. The
    paper reports on inter-annotator agreement and the optimization of the acoustic
    models for forced speech-text alignment in exercises for computer-assisted pronunciation
    training. Example studies based on the corpus data with a phonetic focus include
    topics such as the realization of /h/ and glottal stop, final devoicing of obstruents,
    vowel quantity and quality, pitch range, and tempo.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate some language acquisition facets of an
    auto-adaptative system that can automatically acquire most of the relevant lexical
    knowledge and authoring practices for an application in a given domain. This is
    the LELIO project: producing customized LELIE solutions. Our goal, within the
    framework of LELIE (a system that tags language uses that do not follow the Constrained
    Natural Language principles), is to automate the long, costly and error prone
    lexical customization of LELIE to a given application domain. Technical texts
    being relatively restricted in terms of syntax and lexicon, results obtained show
    that this approach is feasible and relatively reliable. By auto-adaptative, we
    mean that the system learns from a sample of the application corpus the various
    lexical terms and uses crucial for LELIE to work properly (e.g. verb uses, fuzzy
    terms, business terms, stylistic patterns). A technical writer validation method
    is developed at each step of the acquisition.'

  abstract: The fact that Japanese employs scriptio continua, or a writing system
    without spaces, complicates the first step of an NLP pipeline. Word segmentation
    is widely used in Japanese language processing, and lexical knowledge is crucial
    for reliable identification of words in text. Although external lexical resources
    like Wikipedia are potentially useful, segmentation mismatch prevents them from
    being straightforwardly incorporated into the word segmentation task. If we intentionally
    violate segmentation standards with the direct incorporation, quantitative evaluation
    will be no longer feasible. To address this problem, we propose to define a separate
    task that directly links given texts to an external resource, that is, wikification
    in the case of Wikipedia. By doing so, we can circumvent segmentation mismatch
    that may not necessarily be important for downstream applications. As the first
    step to realize the idea, we design the task of Japanese wikification and construct
    wikification corpora. We annotated subsets of the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary
    Written Japanese plus Twitter short messages. We also implement a simple wikifier
    and investigate its performance on these corpora.

  abstract: This article presents Walenty - a new valence dictionary of Polish predicates,
    concentrating on its creation process and access via Internet browser. The dictionary
    contains two layers, syntactic and semantic. The syntactic layer describes syntactic
    and morphosyntactic constraints predicates put on their dependants. The semantic
    layer shows how predicates and their arguments are involved in a situation described
    in an utterance. These two layers are connected, representing how semantic arguments
    can be realised on the surface. Walenty also contains a powerful phraseological
    (idiomatic) component. Walenty has been created and can be accessed remotely with
    a dedicated tool called Slowal. In this article, we focus on most important functionalities
    of this system. First, we will depict how to access the dictionary and how built-in
    filtering system (covering both syntactic and semantic phenomena) works. Later,
    we will describe the process of creating dictionary by Slowal tool that both supports
    and controls the work of lexicographers.

  abstract: 'Language models are used in applications as diverse as speech recognition,
    optical character recognition and information retrieval. They are used to predict
    word appearance, and to weight the importance of words in these applications.
    One basic element of language models is the list of words in a language. Another
    is the unigram frequency of each word. But this basic information is not available
    for most languages in the world. Since the multilingual Wikipedia project encourages
    the production of encyclopedic-like articles in many world languages, we can find
    there an ever-growing source of text from which to extract these two language
    modelling elements: word list and frequency. Here we present a simple technique
    for converting this Wikipedia text into lexicons of weighted unigrams for the
    more than 280 languages present currently present in Wikipedia. The lexicons produced,
    and the source code for producing them in a Linux-based system are here made available
    for free on the Web.'

  abstract: GLAWI is a free, large-scale and versatile Machine-Readable Dictionary
    (MRD) that has been extracted from the French language edition of Wiktionary,
    called Wiktionnaire. In (Sajous and Hathout, 2015), we introduced GLAWI, gave
    the rationale behind the creation of this lexicographic resource and described
    the extraction process, focusing on the conversion and standardization of the
    heterogeneous data provided by this collaborative dictionary. In the current article,
    we describe the content of GLAWI and illustrate how it is structured. We also
    suggest various applications, ranging from linguistic studies, NLP applications
    to psycholinguistic experimentation. They all can take advantage of the diversity
    of the lexical knowledge available in GLAWI. Besides this diversity and extensive
    lexical coverage, GLAWI is also remarkable because it is the only free lexical
    resource of contemporary French that contains definitions. This unique material
    opens way to the renewal of MRD-based methods, notably the automated extraction
    and acquisition of semantic relations.

  abstract: "In recent years, several datasets have been released that include images\
    \ and text, giving impulse to new methods that combine natural language processing\
    \ and computer vision. However, there is a need for datasets of images in their\
    \ natural textual context. The ION corpus contains 300K news articles published\
    \ between August 2014 - 2015 in five online newspapers from two countries. The\
    \ 1-year coverage over multiple publishers ensures a broad scope in terms of topics,\
    \ image quality and editorial viewpoints. The corpus consists of JSON-LD files\
    \ with the following data about each article: the original URL of the article\
    \ on the news publisher\u2019s website, the date of publication, the headline\
    \ of the article, the URL of the image displayed with the article (if any), and\
    \ the caption of that image. Neither the article text nor the images themselves\
    \ are included in the corpus. Instead, the images are distributed as high-dimensional\
    \ feature vectors extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network, anticipating\
    \ their use in computer vision tasks. The article text is represented as a list\
    \ of automatically generated entity and topic annotations in the form of Wikipedia/DBpedia\
    \ pages. This facilitates the selection of subsets of the corpus for separate\
    \ analysis or evaluation."

  abstract: There are as many sign languages as there are deaf communities in the
    world. Linguists have been collecting corpora of different sign languages and
    annotating them extensively in order to study and understand their properties.
    On the other hand, the field of computer vision has approached the sign language
    recognition problem as a grand challenge and research efforts have intensified
    in the last 20 years. However, corpora collected for studying linguistic properties
    are often not suitable for sign language recognition as the statistical methods
    used in the field require large amounts of data. Recently, with the availability
    of inexpensive depth cameras, groups from the computer vision community have started
    collecting corpora with large number of repetitions for sign language recognition
    research. In this paper, we present the BosphorusSign Turkish Sign Language corpus,
    which consists of 855 sign and phrase samples from the health, finance and everyday
    life domains. The corpus is collected using the state-of-the-art Microsoft Kinect
    v2 depth sensor, and will be the first in this sign language research field. Furthermore,
    there will be annotations rendered by linguists so that the corpus will appeal
    both to the linguistic and sign language recognition research communities.

  abstract: Speech data currently receives a growing attention and is an important
    source of information. We still lack suitable corpora of transcribed speech annotated
    with semantic roles that can be used for semantic role labeling (SRL), which is
    not the case for written data. Semantic role labeling in speech data is a challenging
    and complex task due to the lack of sentence boundaries and the many transcription
    errors such as insertion, deletion and misspellings of words. In written data,
    SRL evaluation is performed at the sentence level, but in speech data sentence
    boundaries identification is still a bottleneck which makes evaluation more complex.
    In this work, we semi-automatically align the predicates found in transcribed
    speech obtained with an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) with the predicates
    found in the corresponding written documents of the OntoNotes corpus and manually
    align the semantic roles of these predicates thus obtaining annotated semantic
    frames in the speech data. This data can serve as gold standard alignments for
    future research in semantic role labeling of speech data.

    \ prosessing related to the real world, such as symbol grounding, language generation,\
    \ and nonlinguistic data search by natural language queries. In order to concentrate\
    \ on language ambiguities, we propose to use a well-defined \u201Creal world,\u201D\
    \ that is game states. We built a corpus consisting of pairs of sentences and\
    \ a game state. The game we focus on is shogi (Japanese chess). We collected 742,286\
    \ commentary sentences in Japanese. They are spontaneously generated contrary\
    \ to natural language annotations in many image datasets provided by human workers\
    \ on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We defined domain specific named entities and we\
    \ segmented 2,508 sentences into words manually and annotated each word with a\
    \ named entity tag. We describe a detailed definition of named entities and show\
    \ some statistics of our game commentary corpus. We also show the results of the\
    \ experiments of word segmentation and named entity recognition. The accuracies\
    \ are as high as those on general domain texts indicating that we are ready to\

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the organization and the implementation of
    the CAMOMILE collaborative annotation framework for multimodal, multimedia, multilingual
    (3M) data. Given the versatile nature of the analysis which can be performed on
    3M data, the structure of the server was kept intentionally simple in order to
    preserve its genericity, relying on standard Web technologies. Layers of annotations,
    defined as data associated to a media fragment from the corpus, are stored in
    a database and can be managed through standard interfaces with authentication.
    Interfaces tailored specifically to the needed task can then be developed in an
    agile way, relying on simple but reliable services for the management of the centralized
    annotations. We then present our implementation of an active learning scenario
    for person annotation in video, relying on the CAMOMILE server; during a dry run
    experiment, the manual annotation of 716 speech segments was thus propagated to
    3504 labeled tracks. The code of the CAMOMILE framework is distributed in open
    source.

  abstract: The Frankfurt Image GestURE corpus (FIGURE) is introduced. The corpus
    data is collected in an experimental setting where 50 naive participants spontaneously
    produced gestures in response to five to six terms from a total of 27 stimulus
    terms. The stimulus terms have been compiled mainly from image schemata from psycholinguistics,
    since such schemata provide a panoply of abstract contents derived from natural
    language use. The gestures have been annotated for kinetic features. FIGURE aims
    at finding (sets of) stable kinetic feature configurations associated with the
    stimulus terms. Given such configurations, they can be used for designing HCI
    gestures that go beyond pre-defined gesture vocabularies or touchpad gestures.
    It is found, for instance, that movement trajectories are far more informative
    than handshapes, speaking against purely handshape-based HCI vocabularies. Furthermore,
    the mean temporal duration of hand and arm movements associated vary with the
    stimulus terms, indicating a dynamic dimension not covered by vocabulary-based
    approaches. Descriptive results are presented and related to findings from gesture
    studies and natural language dialogue.

  abstract: "The term smart home refers to a living environment that by its connected\
    \ sensors and actuators is capable of providing intelligent and contextualised\
    \ support to its user. This may result in automated behaviors that blends into\
    \ the user\u2019s daily life. However, currently most smart homes do not provide\
    \ such intelligent support. A first step towards such intelligent capabilities\
    \ lies in learning automation rules by observing the user\u2019s behavior. We\
    \ present a new type of corpus for learning such rules from user behavior as observed\
    \ from the events in a smart homes sensor and actuator network. The data contains\
    \ information about intended tasks by the users and synchronized events from this\
    \ network. It is derived from interactions of 59 users with the smart home in\
    \ order to solve five tasks. The corpus contains recordings of more than 40 different\
    \ types of data streams and has been segmented and pre-processed to increase signal\
    \ quality. Overall, the data shows a high noise level on specific data types that\
    \ can be filtered out by a simple smoothing approach. The resulting data provides\
    \ insights into event patterns resulting from task specific user behavior and\
    \ thus constitutes a basis for machine learning approaches to learn automation\
    \ rules."

  abstract: In this paper we describe our work in building an online tool for manually
    annotating texts in any spoken language with SignWriting in any sign language.
    The existence of such tool will allow the creation of parallel corpora between
    spoken and sign languages that can be used to bootstrap the creation of efficient
    tools for the Deaf community. As an example, a parallel corpus between English
    and American Sign Language could be used for training Machine Learning models
    for automatic translation between the two languages. Clearly, this kind of tool
    must be designed in a way that it eases the task of human annotators, not only
    by being easy to use, but also by giving smart suggestions as the annotation progresses,
    in order to save time and effort. By building a collaborative, online, easy to
    use annotation tool for building parallel corpora between spoken and sign languages
    we aim at helping the development of proper resources for sign languages that
    can then be used in state-of-the-art models currently used in tools for spoken
    languages. There are several issues and difficulties in creating this kind of
    resource, and our presented tool already deals with some of them, like adequate
    text representation of a sign and many to many alignments between words and signs.

  abstract: In South-Asian languages such as Hindi and Urdu, action verbs having compound
    constructions and serial verbs constructions pose serious problems for natural
    language processing and other linguistic tasks. Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language
    spoken by 51, 500, 0001 speakers in India. Action verbs that occur spontaneously
    in day-to-day communication are highly ambiguous in nature semantically and as
    a consequence cause disambiguation issues that are relevant and applicable to
    Language Technologies (LT) like Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language
    Processing (NLP). IMAGACT4ALL is an ontology-driven web-based platform developed
    by the University of Florence for storing action verbs and their inter-relations.
    This group is currently collaborating with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in
    India to connect Indian languages on this platform. Action verbs are frequently
    used in both written and spoken discourses and refer to various meanings because
    of their polysemic nature. The IMAGACT4ALL platform stores each 3d animation image,
    each one of them referring to a variety of possible ontological types, which in
    turn makes the annotation task for the annotator quite challenging with regard
    to selecting verb argument structure having a range of probability distribution.
    The authors, in this paper, discuss the issues and challenges such as complex
    predicates (compound and conjunct verbs), ambiguously animated video illustrations,
    semantic discrepancies, and the factors of verb-selection preferences that have
    produced significant problems in annotating Urdu verbs on the IMAGACT ontology.

  abstract: 'Ontologies are powerful to support semantic based applications and intelligent
    systems. While ontology learning are challenging due to its bottleneck in handcrafting
    structured knowledge sources and training data. To address this difficulty, many
    researchers turn to ontology enrichment and population using external knowledge
    sources such as DBpedia. In this paper, we propose a method using DBpedia in a
    different manner. We utilize relation instances in DBpedia to supervise the ontology
    learning procedure from unstructured text, rather than populate the ontology structure
    as a post-processing step. We construct three language resources in areas of computer
    science: enriched Wikipedia concept tree, domain ontology, and gold standard from
    NSFC taxonomy. Experiment shows that the result of ontology learning from corpus
    of computer science can be improved via the relation instances extracted from
    DBpedia in the same field. Furthermore, making distinction between the relation
    instances and applying a proper weighting scheme in the learning procedure lead
    to even better result.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents the Event and Implied Situation Ontology (ESO), a
    manually constructed resource which formalizes the pre and post situations of
    events and the roles of the entities affected by an event. The ontology is built
    on top of existing resources such as WordNet, SUMO and FrameNet. The ontology
    is injected to the Predicate Matrix, a resource that integrates predicate and
    role information from amongst others FrameNet, VerbNet, PropBank, NomBank and
    WordNet. We illustrate how these resources are used on large document collections
    to detect information that otherwise would have remained implicit. The ontology
    is evaluated on two aspects: recall and precision based on a manually annotated
    corpus and secondly, on the quality of the knowledge inferred by the situation
    assertions in the ontology. Evaluation results on the quality of the system show
    that 50% of the events typed and enriched with ESO assertions are correct.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe experiments on the morphosyntactic annotation
    of historical language varieties for the example of Middle Low German (MLG), the
    official language of the German Hanse during the Middle Ages and a dominant language
    around the Baltic Sea by the time. To our best knowledge, this is the first experiment
    in automatically producing morphosyntactic annotations for Middle Low German,
    and accordingly, no part-of-speech (POS) tagset is currently agreed upon. In our
    experiment, we illustrate how ontology-based specifications of projected annotations
    can be employed to circumvent this issue: Instead of training and evaluating against
    a given tagset, we decomponse it into independent features which are predicted
    independently by a neural network. Using consistency constraints (axioms) from
    an ontology, then, the predicted feature probabilities are decoded into a sound
    ontological representation. Using these representations, we can finally bootstrap
    a POS tagset capturing only morphosyntactic features which could be reliably predicted.
    In this way, our approach is capable to optimize precision and recall of morphosyntactic
    annotations simultaneously with bootstrapping a tagset rather than performing
    iterative cycles.'

  abstract: "As part of a human-robot interaction project, we are interested by gestural\
    \ modality as one of many ways to communicate. In order to develop a relevant\
    \ gesture recognition system associated to a smart home butler robot. Our methodology\
    \ is based on an IQ game-like Wizard of Oz experiment to collect spontaneous and\
    \ implicitly produced gestures in an ecological context. During the experiment,\
    \ the subject has to use non-verbal cues (i.e. gestures) to interact with a robot\
    \ that is the referee. The subject is unaware that his gestures will be the focus\
    \ of our study. In the second part of the experiment, we asked the subjects to\
    \ do the gestures he had produced in the experiment, those are the explicit gestures.\
    \ The implicit gestures are compared with explicitly produced ones to determine\
    \ a relevant ontology. This preliminary qualitative analysis will be the base\
    \ to build a big data corpus in order to optimize acceptance of the gesture dictionary\
    \ in coherence with the \u201Csocio-affective glue\u201D dynamics."

  abstract: In this paper we describe our work in progress in the automatic development
    of a taxonomy of Spanish nouns, we offer the Perl implementation we have so far,
    and we discuss the different problems that still need to be addressed. We designed
    a statistically-based taxonomy induction algorithm consisting of a combination
    of different strategies not involving explicit linguistic knowledge. Being all
    quantitative, the strategies we present are however of different nature. Some
    of them are based on the computation of distributional similarity coefficients
    which identify pairs of sibling words or co-hyponyms, while others are based on
    asymmetric co-occurrence and identify pairs of parent-child words or hypernym-hyponym
    relations. A decision making process is then applied to combine the results of
    the previous steps, and finally connect lexical units to a basic structure containing
    the most general categories of the language. We evaluate the quality of the taxonomy
    both manually and also using Spanish Wordnet as a gold-standard. We estimate an
    average of 89.07% precision and 25.49% recall considering only the results which
    the algorithm presents with high degree of certainty, or 77.86% precision and
    33.72% recall considering all results.

  abstract: Part-of-Speech(POS) tagging is a key step in many NLP algorithms. However,
    tweets are difficult to POS tag because they are short, are not always written
    maintaining formal grammar and proper spelling, and abbreviations are often used
    to overcome their restricted lengths. Arabic tweets also show a further range
    of linguistic phenomena such as usage of different dialects, romanised Arabic
    and borrowing foreign words. In this paper, we present an evaluation and a detailed
    error analysis of state-of-the-art POS taggers for Arabic when applied to Arabic
    tweets. On the basis of this analysis, we combine normalisation and external knowledge
    to handle the domain noisiness and exploit bootstrapping to construct extra training
    data in order to improve POS tagging for Arabic tweets. Our results show significant
    improvements over the performance of a number of well-known taggers for Arabic.

  abstract: "This paper relates to the challenge of morphological tagging and lemmatization\
    \ in morphologically rich languages by example of German and Latin. We focus on\
    \ the question what a practitioner can expect when using state-of-the-art solutions\
    \ out of the box. Moreover, we contrast these with old(er) methods and implementations\
    \ for POS tagging. We examine to what degree recent efforts in tagger development\
    \ are reflected by improved accuracies \u2015 and at what cost, in terms of training\
    \ and processing time. We also conduct in-domain vs. out-domain evaluation. Out-domain\
    \ evaluations are particularly insightful because the distribution of the data\
    \ which is being tagged by a user will typically differ from the distribution\
    \ on which the tagger has been trained. Furthermore, two lemmatization techniques\
    \ are evaluated. Finally, we compare pipeline tagging vs. a tagging approach that\
    \ acknowledges dependencies between inflectional categories."

  abstract: We present a morphological tagger for Latin, called TTLab Latin Tagger
    based on Conditional Random Fields (TLT-CRF) which uses a large Latin lexicon.
    Beyond Part of Speech (PoS), TLT-CRF tags eight inflectional categories of verbs,
    adjectives or nouns. It utilizes a statistical model based on CRFs together with
    a rule interpreter that addresses scenarios of sparse training data. We present
    results of evaluating TLT-CRF to answer the question what can be learnt following
    the paradigm of 1st order CRFs in conjunction with a large lexical resource and
    a rule interpreter. Furthermore, we investigate the contigency of representational
    features and targeted parts of speech to learn about selective features.

  abstract: Because of the small size of Romanian corpora, the performance of a PoS
    tagger or a dependency parser trained with the standard supervised methods fall
    far short from the performance achieved in most languages. That is why, we apply
    state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual transfer on Romanian tagging and parsing,
    from English and several Romance languages. We compare the performance with monolingual
    systems trained with sets of different sizes and establish that training on a
    few sentences in target language yields better results than transferring from
    large datasets in other languages.

  abstract: In this paper we present a tagger developed for inflectionally rich languages
    for which both a training corpus and a lexicon are available. We do not constrain
    the tagger by the lexicon entries, allowing both for lexicon incompleteness and
    noisiness. By using the lexicon indirectly through features we allow for known
    and unknown words to be tagged in the same manner. We test our tagger on Slovene
    data, obtaining a 25% error reduction of the best previous results both on known
    and unknown words. Given that Slovene is, in comparison to some other Slavic languages,
    a well-resourced language, we perform experiments on the impact of token (corpus)
    vs. type (lexicon) supervision, obtaining useful insights in how to balance the
    effort of extending resources to yield better tagging results.

  abstract: 'Treebanks are important resources for researchers in natural language
    processing, speech recognition, theoretical linguistics, etc. To strengthen the
    automatic processing of the Vietnamese language, a Vietnamese treebank has been
    built. However, the quality of this treebank is not satisfactory and is a possible
    source for the low performance of Vietnamese language processing. We have been
    building a new treebank for Vietnamese with about 40,000 sentences annotated with
    three layers: word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and bracketing. In this
    paper, we describe several challenges of Vietnamese language and how we solve
    them in developing annotation guidelines. We also present our methods to improve
    the quality of the annotation guidelines and ensure annotation accuracy and consistency.
    Experiment results show that inter-annotator agreement ratios and accuracy are
    higher than 90% which is satisfactory.'

  abstract: This paper provides a new method to correct annotation errors in a treebank.
    The previous error correction method constructs a pseudo parallel corpus where
    incorrect partial parse trees are paired with correct ones, and extracts error
    correction rules from the parallel corpus. By applying these rules to a treebank,
    the method corrects errors. However, this method does not achieve wide coverage
    of error correction. To achieve wide coverage, our method adopts a different approach.
    In our method, we consider that an infrequent pattern which can be transformed
    to a frequent one is an annotation error pattern. Based on a tree mining technique,
    our method seeks such infrequent tree patterns, and constructs error correction
    rules each of which consists of an infrequent pattern and a corresponding frequent
    pattern. We conducted an experiment using the Penn Treebank. We obtained 1,987
    rules which are not constructed by the previous method, and the rules achieved
    good precision.

  abstract: 'The question of the type of text used as primary data in treebanks is
    of certain importance. First, it has an influence at the discourse level: an article
    is not organized in the same way as a novel or a technical document. Moreover,
    it also has consequences in terms of semantic interpretation: some types of texts
    can be easier to interpret than others. We present in this paper a new type of
    treebank which presents the particularity to answer to specific needs of experimental
    linguistic. It is made of short texts (book backcovers) that presents a strong
    coherence in their organization and can be rapidly interpreted. This type of text
    is adapted to short reading sessions, making it easy to acquire physiological
    data (e.g. eye movement, electroencepholagraphy). Such a resource offers reliable
    data when looking for correlations between computational models and human language
    processing.'

  abstract: This paper presents a new linguistic resource for the study and computational
    processing of Portuguese. CINTIL DependencyBank PREMIUM is a corpus of Portuguese
    news text, accurately manually annotated with a wide range of linguistic information
    (morpho-syntax, named-entities, syntactic function and semantic roles), making
    it an invaluable resource specially for the development and evaluation of data-driven
    natural language processing tools. The corpus is under active development, reaching
    4,000 sentences in its current version. The paper also reports on the training
    and evaluation of a dependency parser over this corpus. CINTIL DependencyBank
    PREMIUM is freely-available for research purposes through META-SHARE.

  abstract: This paper presents the first version of Estonian Universal Dependencies
    Treebank which has been semi-automatically acquired from Estonian Dependency Treebank
    and comprises ca 400,000 words (ca 30,000 sentences) representing the genres of
    fiction, newspapers and scientific writing. Article analyses the differences between
    two annotation schemes and the conversion procedure to Universal Dependencies
    format. The conversion has been conducted by manually created Constraint Grammar
    transfer rules. As the rules enable to consider unbounded context, include lexical
    information and both flat and tree structure features at the same time, the method
    has proved to be reliable and flexible enough to handle most of transformations.
    The automatic conversion procedure achieved LAS 95.2%, UAS 96.3% and LA 98.4%.
    If punctuation marks were excluded from the calculations, we observed LAS 96.4%,
    UAS 97.7% and LA 98.2%. Still the refinement of the guidelines and methodology
    is needed in order to re-annotate some syntactic phenomena, e.g. inter-clausal
    relations. Although automatic rules usually make quite a good guess even in obscure
    conditions, some relations should be checked and annotated manually after the
    main conversion.

  abstract: This paper presents the construction of an open-source dependency treebank
    of spoken Slovenian, the first syntactically annotated collection of spontaneous
    speech in Slovenian. The treebank has been manually annotated using the Universal
    Dependencies annotation scheme, a one-layer syntactic annotation scheme with a
    high degree of cross-modality, cross-framework and cross-language interoperability.
    In this original application of the scheme to spoken language transcripts, we
    address a wide spectrum of syntactic particularities in speech, either by extending
    the scope of application of existing universal labels or by proposing new speech-specific
    extensions. The initial analysis of the resulting treebank and its comparison
    with the written Slovenian UD treebank confirms significant syntactic differences
    between the two language modalities, with spoken data consisting of shorter and
    more elliptic sentences, less and simpler nominal phrases, and more relations
    marking disfluencies, interaction, deixis and modality.

  abstract: This paper introduces the ALT project initiated by the Advanced Speech
    Translation Research and Development Promotion Center (ASTREC), NICT, Kyoto, Japan.
    The aim of this project is to accelerate NLP research for Asian languages such
    as Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Laos, Malay, Myanmar, Philippine, Thai and Vietnamese.
    The original resource for this project was English articles that were randomly
    selected from Wikinews. The project has so far created a corpus for Myanmar and
    will extend in scope to include other languages in the near future. A 20000-sentence
    corpus of Myanmar that has been manually translated from an English corpus has
    been word segmented, word aligned, part-of-speech tagged and constituency parsed
    by human annotators. In this paper, we present the implementation steps for creating
    the treebank in detail, including a description of the ALT web-based treebanking
    tool. Moreover, we report statistics on the annotation quality of the Myanmar
    treebank created so far.

  abstract: META-NET is a European network of excellence, founded in 2010, that consists
    of 60 research centres in 34 European countries. One of the key visions and goals
    of META-NET is a truly multilingual Europe, which is substantially supported and
    realised through language technologies. In this article we provide an overview
    of recent developments around the multilingual Europe topic, we also describe
    recent and upcoming events as well as recent and upcoming strategy papers. Furthermore,
    we provide overviews of two new emerging initiatives, the CEF.AT and ELRC activity
    on the one hand and the Cracking the Language Barrier federation on the other.
    The paper closes with several suggested next steps in order to address the current
    challenges and to open up new opportunities.

    \ in the field concerning ethical issues, which translates into a willingness\

    \ see ethics be included in major conferences themes. We finally discuss the limits\

  abstract: "This article presents the latest dissemination activities and technical\
    \ developments that were carried out for the International Standard Language Resource\
    \ Number (ISLRN) service. It also recalls the main principle and submission process\
    \ for providers to obtain their 13-digit ISLRN identifier. Up to March 2016, 2100\
    \ Language Resources were allocated an ISLRN number, not only ELRA\u2019s and\
    \ LDC\u2019s catalogued Language Resources, but also the ones from other important\
    \ organisations like the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the Resource Management\
    \ Agency (RMA) who expressed their strong support to this initiative.In the research\
    \ field, not only assigning a unique identification number is important, but also\
    \ referring to a Language Resource as an object per se (like publications) has\
    \ now become an obvious requirement. The ISLRN could also become an important\
    \ parameter to be considered to compute a Language Resource Impact Factor (LRIF)\
    \ in order to recognize the merits of the producers of Language Resources. Integrating\
    \ the ISLRN number into a LR-oriented bibliographical reference is thus part of\
    \ the objective. The idea is to make use of a BibTeX entry that would take into\
    \ account Language Resources items, including ISLRN.The ISLRN being a requested\
    \ field within the LREC 2016 submission, we expect that several other LRs will\
    \ be allocated an ISLRN number by the conference date. With this expansion, this\
    \ number aims to be a spreadly-used LR citation instrument within works referring\
    \ to LRs."

  abstract: The paper introduces a new annotated French data set for Sentiment Analysis,
    which is a currently missing resource. It focuses on the collection from Twitter
    of data related to the socio-political debate about the reform of the bill for
    wedding in France. The design of the annotation scheme is described, which extends
    a polarity label set by making available tags for marking target semantic areas
    and figurative language devices. The annotation process is presented and the disagreement
    discussed, in particular, in the perspective of figurative language use and in
    that of the semantic oriented annotation, which are open challenges for NLP systems.

  abstract: Personality profiling is the task of detecting personality traits of authors
    based on writing style. Several personality typologies exist, however, the Briggs-Myer
    Type Indicator (MBTI) is particularly popular in the non-scientific community,
    and many people use it to analyse their own personality and talk about the results
    online. Therefore, large amounts of self-assessed data on MBTI are readily available
    on social-media platforms such as Twitter. We present a novel corpus of tweets
    annotated with the MBTI personality type and gender of their author for six Western
    European languages (Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish). We
    outline the corpus creation and annotation, show statistics of the obtained data
    distributions and present first baselines on Myers-Briggs personality profiling
    and gender prediction for all six languages.

  abstract: Microblogging platforms such as Twitter provide active communication channels
    during mass convergence and emergency events such as earthquakes, typhoons. During
    the sudden onset of a crisis situation, affected people post useful information
    on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other humanitarian disaster
    response efforts, if processed timely and effectively. Processing social media
    information pose multiple challenges such as parsing noisy, brief and informal
    messages, learning information categories from the incoming stream of messages
    and classifying them into different classes among others. One of the basic necessities
    of many of these tasks is the availability of data, in particular human-annotated
    data. In this paper, we present human-annotated Twitter corpora collected during
    19 different crises that took place between 2013 and 2015. To demonstrate the
    utility of the annotations, we train machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we
    publish first largest word2vec word embeddings trained on 52 million crisis-related
    tweets. To deal with tweets language issues, we present human-annotated normalized
    lexical resources for different lexical variations.

  abstract: Code-Switching (CS) between two languages is extremely common in communities
    with societal multilingualism where speakers switch between two or more languages
    when interacting with each other. CS has been extensively studied in spoken language
    by linguists for several decades but with the popularity of social-media and less
    formal Computer Mediated Communication, we now see a big rise in the use of CS
    in the text form. This poses interesting challenges and a need for computational
    processing of such code-switched data. As with any Computational Linguistic analysis
    and Natural Language Processing tools and applications, we need annotated data
    for understanding, processing, and generation of code-switched language. In this
    study, we focus on CS between English and Hindi Tweets extracted from the Twitter
    stream of Hindi-English bilinguals. We present an annotation scheme for annotating
    the pragmatic functions of CS in Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-switched tweets based
    on a linguistic analysis and some initial experiments.

  abstract: We present an attempt to port the international syntactic annotation scheme,
    Universal Dependencies, to the Japanese language in this paper. Since the Japanese
    syntactic structure is usually annotated on the basis of unique chunk-based dependencies,
    we first introduce word-based dependencies by using a word unit called the Short
    Unit Word, which usually corresponds to an entry in the lexicon UniDic. Porting
    is done by mapping the part-of-speech tagset in UniDic to the universal part-of-speech
    tagset, and converting a constituent-based treebank to a typed dependency tree.
    The conversion is not straightforward, and we discuss the problems that arose
    in the conversion and the current solutions. A treebank consisting of 10,000 sentences
    was built by converting the existent resources and currently released to the public.

  abstract: Cross-linguistically consistent annotation is necessary for sound comparative
    evaluation and cross-lingual learning experiments. It is also useful for multilingual
    system development and comparative linguistic studies. Universal Dependencies
    is an open community effort to create cross-linguistically consistent treebank
    annotation for many languages within a dependency-based lexicalist framework.
    In this paper, we describe v1 of the universal guidelines, the underlying design
    principles, and the currently available treebanks for 33 languages.

  abstract: 'The recognition of multiword expressions (MWEs) in a sentence is important
    for such linguistic analyses as syntactic and semantic parsing, because it is
    known that combining an MWE into a single token improves accuracy for various
    NLP tasks, such as dependency parsing and constituency parsing. However, MWEs
    are not annotated in Penn Treebank. Furthermore, when converting word-based dependency
    to MWE-aware dependency directly, one could combine nodes in an MWE into a single
    node. Nevertheless, this method often leads to the following problem: A node derived
    from an MWE could have multiple heads and the whole dependency structure including
    MWE might be cyclic. Therefore we converted a phrase structure to a dependency
    structure after establishing an MWE as a single subtree. This approach can avoid
    an occurrence of multiple heads and/or cycles. In this way, we constructed an
    English dependency corpus taking into account compound function words, which are
    one type of MWEs that serve as functional expressions. In addition, we report
    experimental results of dependency parsing using a constructed corpus.'

  abstract: TANL is a suite of tools for text analytics based on the software architecture
    paradigm of data driven pipelines. The strategies for upgrading TANL to the use
    of Universal Dependencies range from a minimalistic approach consisting of introducing
    pre/post-processing steps into the native pipeline to revising the whole pipeline.
    We explore the issue in the context of the Italian Treebank, considering both
    the efforts involved, how to avoid losing linguistically relevant information
    and the loss of accuracy in the process. In particular we compare different strategies
    for parsing and discuss the implications of simplifying the pipeline when detailed
    part-of-speech and morphological annotations are not available, as it is the case
    for less resourceful languages. The experiments are relative to the Italian linguistic
    pipeline, but the use of different parsers in our evaluations and the avoidance
    of language specific tagging make the results general enough to be useful in helping
    the transition to UD for other languages.

  abstract: We present a dependency treebank of the Chinese Buddhist Canon, which
    contains 1,514 texts with about 50 million Chinese characters. The treebank was
    created by an automatic parser trained on a smaller treebank, containing four
    manually annotated sutras (Lee and Kong, 2014). We report results on word segmentation,
    part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing, and discuss challenges posed by
    the processing of medieval Chinese. In a case study, we exploit the treebank to
    examine verbs frequently associated with Buddha, and to analyze usage patterns
    of quotative verbs in direct speech. Our results suggest that certain quotative
    verbs imply status differences between the speaker and the listener.

  abstract: 'Polysemy is the capacity for a word to have multiple meanings. Polysemy
    detection is a first step for Word Sense Induction (WSI), which allows to find
    different meanings for a term. The polysemy detection is also important for information
    extraction (IE) systems. In addition, the polysemy detection is important for
    building/enriching terminologies and ontologies. In this paper, we present a novel
    approach to detect if a biomedical term is polysemic, with the long term goal
    of enriching biomedical ontologies. This approach is based on the extraction of
    new features. In this context we propose to extract features following two manners:
    (i) extracted directly from the text dataset, and (ii) from an induced graph.
    Our method obtains an Accuracy and F-Measure of 0.978.'

  abstract: 'We introduce Cro36WSD, a freely-available medium-sized lexical sample
    for Croatian word sense disambiguation (WSD).Cro36WSD comprises 36 words: 12 adjectives,
    12 nouns, and 12 verbs, balanced across both frequency bands and polysemy levels.
    We adopt the multi-label annotation scheme in the hope of lessening the drawbacks
    of discrete sense inventories and obtaining more realistic annotations from human
    experts. Sense-annotated data is collected through multiple annotation rounds
    to ensure high-quality annotations: with a 115 person-hours effort we reached
    an inter-annotator agreement score of 0.877. We analyze the obtained data and
    perform a correlation analysis between several relevant variables, including word
    frequency, number of senses, sense distribution skewness, average annotation time,
    and the observed inter-annotator agreement (IAA). Using the obtained data, we
    compile multi- and single-labeled dataset variants using different label aggregation
    schemes. Finally, we evaluate three different baseline WSD models on both dataset
    variants and report on the insights gained. We make both dataset variants freely
    available.'

  abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems tend to have a strong bias towards
    assigning the Most Frequent Sense (MFS), which results in high performance on
    the MFS but in a very low performance on the less frequent senses. We addressed
    the MFS bias in WSD systems by combining the output from a WSD system with a set
    of mostly static features to create a MFS classifier to decide when to and not
    to choose the MFS. The output from this MFS classifier, which is based on the
    Random Forest algorithm, is then used to modify the output from the original WSD
    system. We applied our classifier to one of the state-of-the-art supervised WSD
    systems, i.e. IMS, and to of the best state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD systems,
    i.e. UKB. Our main finding is that we are able to improve the system output in
    terms of choosing between the MFS and the less frequent senses. When we apply
    the MFS classifier to fine-grained WSD, we observe an improvement on the less
    frequent sense cases, whereas we maintain the overall recall.

  abstract: Linking concepts and named entities to knowledge bases has become a crucial
    Natural Language Understanding task. In this respect, recent works have shown
    the key advantage of exploiting textual definitions in various Natural Language
    Processing applications. However, to date there are no reliable large-scale corpora
    of sense-annotated textual definitions available to the research community. In
    this paper we present a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated glosses
    in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both concepts and named
    entities from a unified sense inventory. Our approach for the construction and
    disambiguation of the corpus builds upon the structure of a large multilingual
    semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system; first, we gather
    complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages
    to provide context for disambiguation, and then we combine it with a semantic
    similarity-based refinement. As a result we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual
    definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we make
    it freely available at http://lcl.uniroma1.it/disambiguated-glosses. Experiments
    on Open Information Extraction and Sense Clustering show how two state-of-the-art
    approaches improve their performance by integrating our disambiguated corpus into
    their pipeline.

  abstract: We propose an unsupervised system for a variant of cross-lingual lexical
    substitution (CLLS) to be used in a reading scenario in computer-assisted language
    learning (CALL), in which single-word translations provided by a dictionary are
    ranked according to their appropriateness in context. In contrast to most alternative
    systems, ours does not rely on either parallel corpora or machine translation
    systems, making it suitable for low-resource languages as the language to be learned.
    This is achieved by a graph-based scoring mechanism which can deal with ambiguous
    translations of context words provided by a dictionary. Due to this decoupling
    from the source language, we need monolingual corpus resources only for the target
    language, i.e. the language of the translation candidates. We evaluate our approach
    for the language pair Norwegian Nynorsk-English on an exploratory manually annotated
    gold standard and report promising results. When running our system on the original
    SemEval CLLS task, we rank 6th out of 18 (including 2 baselines and our 2 system
    variants) in the best evaluation.

  abstract: In this paper we present the Corpus of REcommendation STrength (CREST),
    a collection of HTML-formatted clinical guidelines annotated with the location
    of recommendations. Recommendations are labelled with an author-provided indicator
    of their strength of importance. As data was drawn from many disparate authors,
    we define a unified scheme of importance labels, and provide a mapping for each
    guideline. We demonstrate the utility of the corpus and its annotations in some
    initial measurements investigating the type of language constructions associated
    with strong and weak recommendations, and experiments into promising features
    for recommendation classification, both with respect to strong and weak labels,
    and to all labels of the unified scheme. An error analysis indicates that, while
    there is a strong relationship between lexical choices and strength labels, there
    can be substantial variance in the choices made by different authors.

  abstract: Using the Methodius Natural Language Generation (NLG) System, we have
    created a corpus which consists of a collection of generated texts which describe
    ancient Greek artefacts. Each text is linked to two representations created as
    part of the NLG process. The first is a content plan, which uses rhetorical relations
    to describe the high-level discourse structure of the text, and the second is
    a logical form describing the syntactic structure, which is sent to the OpenCCG
    surface realization module to produce the final text output. In recent work, White
    and Howcroft (2015) have used the SPaRKy restaurant corpus, which contains similar
    combination of texts and representations, for their research on the induction
    of rules for the combination of clauses. In the first instance this corpus will
    be used to test their algorithms on an additional domain, and extend their work
    to include the learning of referring expression generation rules. As far as we
    know, the SPaRKy restaurant corpus is the only existing corpus of this type, and
    we hope that the creation of this new corpus in a different domain will provide
    a useful resource to the Natural Language Generation community.

  abstract: The task of recommending relevant scientific literature for a draft academic
    paper has recently received significant interest. In our effort to ease the discovery
    of scientific literature and augment scientific writing, we aim to improve the
    relevance of results based on a shallow semantic analysis of the source document
    and the potential documents to recommend. We investigate the utility of automatic
    argumentative and rhetorical annotation of documents for this purpose. Specifically,
    we integrate automatic Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSC) classification into a
    prototype context-based citation recommendation system and investigate its usefulness
    to the task. We frame citation recommendation as an information retrieval task
    and we use the categories of the annotation schemes to apply different weights
    to the similarity formula. Our results show interesting and consistent correlations
    between the type of citation and the type of sentence containing the relevant
    information.

  abstract: 'This paper presents SciCorp, a corpus of full-text English scientific
    papers of two disciplines, genetics and computational linguistics. The corpus
    comprises co-reference and bridging information as well as information status
    labels. Since SciCorp is annotated with both labels and the respective co-referent
    and bridging links, we believe it is a valuable resource for NLP researchers working
    on scientific articles or on applications such as co-reference resolution, bridging
    resolution or information status classification. The corpus has been reliably
    annotated by independent human coders with moderate inter-annotator agreement
    (average kappa = 0.71). In total, we have annotated 14 full papers containing
    61,045 tokens and marked 8,708 definite noun phrases. The paper describes in detail
    the annotation scheme as well as the resulting corpus. The corpus is available
    for download in two different formats: in an offset-based format and for the co-reference
    annotations in the widely-used, tabular CoNLL-2012 format.'

  abstract: Discourse parsing is a challenging task in NLP and plays a crucial role
    in discourse analysis. To enable discourse analysis for Hindi, Hindi Discourse
    Relations Bank was created on a subset of Hindi TreeBank. The benefits of a discourse
    analyzer in automated discourse analysis, question summarization and question
    answering domains has motivated us to begin work on a discourse analyzer for Hindi.
    In this paper, we focus on discourse connective identification for Hindi. We explore
    various available syntactic features for this task. We also explore the use of
    dependency tree parses present in the Hindi TreeBank and study the impact of the
    same on the performance of the system. We report that the novel dependency features
    introduced have a higher impact on precision, in comparison to the syntactic features
    previously used for this task. In addition, we report a high accuracy of 96% for
    this task.

  abstract: This paper contributes to the limited body of empirical research in the
    domain of discourse structure of information seeking queries. We describe the
    development of an annotation schema for coding topic development in information
    seeking queries and the initial observations from a pilot sample of query sessions.
    The main idea that we explore is the relationship between constant and variable
    discourse entities and their role in tracking changes in the topic progression.
    We argue that the topicalized entities remain stable across development of the
    discourse and can be identified by a simple mechanism where anaphora resolution
    is a precursor. We also claim that a corpus annotated in this framework can be
    used as training data for dialogue management and computational semantics systems.

  abstract: 'This study describes a new corpus of over 60,000 hand-annotated metadiscourse
    acts from 106 OpenCourseWare lectures, from two different disciplines: Physics
    and Economics. Metadiscourse is a set of linguistic expressions that signal different
    functions in the discourse. This type of language is hypothesised to be helpful
    in finding a structure in unstructured text, such as lectures discourse. A brief
    summary is provided about the annotation scheme and labelling procedures, inter-annotator
    reliability statistics, overall distributional statistics, a description of auxiliary
    data that will be distributed with the corpus, and information relating to how
    to obtain the data. The results provide a deeper understanding of lecture structure
    and confirm the reliable coding of metadiscursive acts in academic lectures across
    different disciplines. The next stage of our research will be to build a classification
    model to automate the tagging process, instead of manual annotation, which take
    time and efforts. This is in addition to the use of these tags as indicators of
    the higher level structure of lecture discourse.'

  abstract: 'The paper steps outside the comfort-zone of the traditional NLP tasks
    like automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) to addresses
    two novel problems arising in the automated multilingual news monitoring: segmentation
    of the TV and radio program ASR transcripts into individual stories, and clustering
    of the individual stories coming from various sources and languages into storylines.
    Storyline clustering of stories covering the same events is an essential task
    for inquisitorial media monitoring. We address these two problems jointly by engaging
    the low-dimensional semantic representation capabilities of the sequence to sequence
    neural translation models. To enable joint multi-task learning for multilingual
    neural translation of morphologically rich languages we replace the attention
    mechanism with the sliding-window mechanism and operate the sequence to sequence
    neural translation model on the character-level rather than on the word-level.
    The story segmentation and storyline clustering problem is tackled by examining
    the low-dimensional vectors produced as a side-product of the neural translation
    process. The results of this paper describe a novel approach to the automatic
    story segmentation and storyline clustering problem.'

  abstract: Handling figurative language like irony is currently a challenging task
    in natural language processing. Since irony is commonly used in user-generated
    content, its presence can significantly undermine accurate analysis of opinions
    and sentiment in such texts. Understanding irony is therefore important if we
    want to push the state-of-the-art in tasks such as sentiment analysis. In this
    research, we present the construction of a Twitter dataset for two languages,
    being English and Dutch, and the development of new guidelines for the annotation
    of verbal irony in social media texts. Furthermore, we present some statistics
    on the annotated corpora, from which we can conclude that the detection of contrasting
    evaluations might be a good indicator for recognizing irony.

  abstract: We introduce a framework for quality assurance of corpora, and apply it
    to the Reuters Multilingual Corpus (RCV2). The results of this quality assessment
    of this standard newsprint corpus reveal a significant duplication problem and,
    to a lesser extent, a problem with corrupted articles. From the raw collection
    of some 487,000 articles, almost one tenth are trivial duplicates. A smaller fraction
    of articles appear to be corrupted and should be excluded for that reason. The
    detailed results are being made available as on-line appendices to this article.
    This effort also demonstrates the beginnings of a constraint-based methodological
    framework for quality assessment and quality assurance for corpora. As a first
    implementation of this framework, we have investigated constraints to verify sample
    integrity, and to diagnose sample duplication, entropy aberrations, and tagging
    inconsistencies. To help identify near-duplicates in the corpus, we have employed
    both entropy measurements and a simple byte bigram incidence digest.

  abstract: Attribution bias refers to the tendency of people to attribute successes
    to their own abilities but failures to external factors. In a business context
    an internal factor might be the restructuring of the firm and an external factor
    might be an unfavourable change in exchange or interest rates. In accounting research,
    the presence of an attribution bias has been demonstrated for the narrative sections
    of the annual financial reports. Previous studies have applied manual content
    analysis to this problem but in this paper we present novel work to automate the
    analysis of attribution bias through using machine learning algorithms. Previous
    studies have only applied manual content analysis on a small scale to reveal such
    a bias in the narrative section of annual financial reports. In our work a group
    of experts in accounting and finance labelled and annotated a list of 32,449 sentences
    from a random sample of UK Preliminary Earning Announcements (PEAs) to allow us
    to examine whether sentences in PEAs contain internal or external attribution
    and which kinds of attributions are linked to positive or negative performance.
    We wished to examine whether human annotators could agree on coding this difficult
    task and whether Machine Learning (ML) could be applied reliably to replicate
    the coding process on a much larger scale. Our best machine learning algorithm
    correctly classified performance sentences with 70% accuracy and detected tone
    and attribution in financial PEAs with accuracy of 79%.

  abstract: 'The paper describes a comparative study of existing and novel text preprocessing
    and classification techniques for domain detection of user utterances. Two corpora
    are considered. The first one contains customer calls to a call centre for further
    call routing; the second one contains answers of call centre employees with different
    kinds of customer orientation behaviour. Seven different unsupervised and supervised
    term weighting methods were applied. The collective use of term weighting methods
    is proposed for classification effectiveness improvement. Four different dimensionality
    reduction methods were applied: stop-words filtering with stemming, feature selection
    based on term weights, feature transformation based on term clustering, and a
    novel feature transformation method based on terms belonging to classes. As classification
    algorithms we used k-NN and a SVM-based algorithm. The numerical experiments have
    shown that the simultaneous use of the novel proposed approaches (collectives
    of term weighting methods and the novel feature transformation method) allows
    reaching the high classification results with very small number of features.'

  abstract: Paraphrase plagiarism is a significant and widespread problem and research
    shows that it is hard to detect. Several methods and automatic systems have been
    proposed to deal with it. However, evaluation and comparison of such solutions
    is not possible because of the unavailability of benchmark corpora with manual
    examples of paraphrase plagiarism. To deal with this issue, we present the novel
    development of a paraphrase plagiarism corpus containing simulated (manually created)
    examples in the Urdu language - a language widely spoken around the world. This
    resource is the first of its kind developed for the Urdu language and we believe
    that it will be a valuable contribution to the evaluation of paraphrase plagiarism
    detection systems.

  abstract: Assessing the suitability of an Open Source Software project for adoption
    requires not only an analysis of aspects related to the code, such as code quality,
    frequency of updates and new version releases, but also an evaluation of the quality
    of support offered in related online forums and issue trackers. Understanding
    the content types of forum messages and issue trackers can provide information
    about the extent to which requests are being addressed and issues are being resolved,
    the percentage of issues that are not being fixed, the cases where the user acknowledged
    that the issue was successfully resolved, etc. These indicators can provide potential
    adopters of the OSS with estimates about the level of available support. We present
    a detailed hierarchy of content types of online forum messages and issue tracker
    comments and a corpus of messages annotated accordingly. We discuss our experiments
    to classify forum messages and issue tracker comments into content-related classes,
    i.e.~to assign them to nodes of the hierarchy. The results are very encouraging.

  abstract: The availability of labelled corpus is of great importance for supervised
    learning in emotion classification tasks. Because it is time-consuming to manually
    label text, hashtags have been used as naturally annotated labels to obtain a
    large amount of labelled training data from microblog. However, natural hashtags
    contain too much noise for it to be used directly in learning algorithms. In this
    paper, we design a three-stage semi-automatic method to construct an emotion corpus
    from microblogs. Firstly, a lexicon based voting approach is used to verify the
    hashtag automatically. Secondly, a SVM based classifier is used to select the
    data whose natural labels are consistent with the predicted labels. Finally, the
    remaining data will be manually examined to filter out the noisy data. Out of
    about 48K filtered Chinese microblogs, 39k microblogs are selected to form the
    final corpus with the Kappa value reaching over 0.92 for the automatic parts and
    over 0.81 for the manual part. The proportion of automatic selection reaches 54.1%.
    Thus, the method can reduce about 44.5% of manual workload for acquiring quality
    data. Experiment on a classifier trained on this corpus shows that it achieves
    comparable results compared to the manually annotated NLP&CC2013 corpus.

  abstract: Social media texts are often fairly informal and conversational, and when
    produced by bilinguals tend to be written in several different languages simultaneously,
    in the same way as conversational speech. The recent availability of large social
    media corpora has thus also made large-scale code-switched resources available
    for research. The paper addresses the issues of evaluation and comparison these
    new corpora entail, by defining an objective measure of corpus level complexity
    of code-switched texts. It is also shown how this formal measure can be used in
    practice, by applying it to several code-switched corpora.

  abstract: To attract foreign students is among the goals of the Karlsruhe Institute
    of Technology (KIT). One obstacle to achieving this goal is that lectures at KIT
    are usually held in German which many foreign students are not sufficiently proficient
    in, as, e.g., opposed to English. While the students from abroad are learning
    German during their stay at KIT, it is challenging to become proficient enough
    in it in order to follow a lecture. As a solution to this problem we offer our
    automatic simultaneous lecture translation. It translates German lectures into
    English in real time. While not as good as human interpreters, the system is available
    at a price that KIT can afford in order to offer it in potentially all lectures.
    In order to assess whether the quality of the system we have conducted a user
    study. In this paper we present this study, the way it was conducted and its results.
    The results indicate that the quality of the system has passed a threshold as
    to be able to support students in their studies. The study has helped to identify
    the most crucial weaknesses of the systems and has guided us which steps to take
    next.

  abstract: We present our guidelines and annotation procedure to create a human corrected
    machine translated post-edited corpus for the Modern Standard Arabic. Our overarching
    goal is to use the annotated corpus to develop automatic machine translation post-editing
    systems for Arabic that can be used to help accelerate the human revision process
    of translated texts. The creation of any manually annotated corpus usually presents
    many challenges. In order to address these challenges, we created comprehensive
    and simplified annotation guidelines which were used by a team of five annotators
    and one lead annotator. In order to ensure a high annotation agreement between
    the annotators, multiple training sessions were held and regular inter-annotator
    agreement measures were performed to check the annotation quality. The created
    corpus of manual post-edited translations of English to Arabic articles is the
    largest to date for this language pair.

  abstract: Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) is one of the most widely used components
    in spoken language processing applications. ASR errors are of varying importance
    with respect to the application, making error analysis keys to improving speech
    processing applications. Knowing the most serious errors for the applicative case
    is critical to build better systems. In the context of Automatic Speech Recognition
    (ASR) used as a first step towards Named Entity Recognition (NER) in speech, error
    seriousness is usually determined by their frequency, due to the use of the WER
    as metric to evaluate the ASR output, despite the emergence of more relevant measures
    in the literature. We propose to use a different evaluation metric form the literature
    in order to classify ASR errors according to their seriousness for NER. Our results
    show that the ASR errors importance is ranked differently depending on the used
    evaluation metric. A more detailed analysis shows that the estimation of the error
    impact given by the ATENE metric is more adapted to the NER task than the estimation
    based only on the most used frequency metric WER.

  abstract: The aim of this experiment is to present an easy way to compare fragments
    of texts in order to detect (supposed) results of copy & paste operations between
    articles in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The search space
    of the comparisons is a corpus labeled as NLP4NLP gathering a large part of the
    NLP field. The study is centered on LREC papers in both directions, first with
    an LREC paper borrowing a fragment of text from the collection, and secondly in
    the reverse direction with fragments of LREC documents borrowed and inserted in
    the collection.

  abstract: "Motivated by the adage that a \u201Cpicture is worth a thousand words\u201D\
    \ it can be reasoned that automatically enriching the textual content of a document\
    \ with relevant images can increase the readability of a document. Moreover, features\
    \ extracted from the additional image data inserted into the textual content of\
    \ a document may, in principle, be also be used by a retrieval engine to better\
    \ match the topic of a document with that of a given query. In this paper, we\
    \ describe our approach of building a ground truth dataset to enable further research\
    \ into automatic addition of relevant images to text documents. The dataset is\
    \ comprised of the official ImageCLEF 2010 collection (a collection of images\
    \ with textual metadata) to serve as the images available for automatic enrichment\
    \ of text, a set of 25 benchmark documents that are to be enriched, which in this\
    \ case are children\u2019s short stories, and a set of manually judged relevant\
    \ images for each query story obtained by the standard procedure of depth pooling.\
    \ We use this benchmark dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of standard information\
    \ retrieval methods as simple baselines for this task. The results indicate that\
    \ using the whole story as a weighted query, where the weight of each query term\
    \ is its tf-idf value, achieves an precision of 0:1714 within the top 5 retrieved\
    \ images on an average."

  abstract: Text analysis methods widely used in digital humanities often involve
    word co-occurrence, e.g. concept co-occurrence networks. These methods provide
    a useful corpus overview, but cannot determine the predicates that relate co-occurring
    concepts. Our goal was identifying propositions expressing the points supported
    or opposed by participants in international climate negotiations. Word co-occurrence
    methods were not sufficient, and an analysis based on open relation extraction
    had limited coverage for nominal predicates. We present a pipeline which identifies
    the points that different actors support and oppose, via a domain model with support/opposition
    predicates, and analysis rules that exploit the output of semantic role labelling,
    syntactic dependencies and anaphora resolution. Entity linking and keyphrase extraction
    are also performed on the propositions related to each actor. A user interface
    allows examining the main concepts in points supported or opposed by each participant,
    which participants agree or disagree with each other, and about which issues.
    The system is an example of tools that digital humanities scholars are asking
    for, to render rich textual information (beyond word co-occurrence) more amenable
    to quantitative treatment. An evaluation of the tool was satisfactory.

  abstract: The task of Relation Extraction from texts is one of the main challenges
    in the area of Information Extraction, considering the required linguistic knowledge
    and the sophistication of the language processing techniques employed. This task
    aims at identifying and classifying semantic relations that occur between entities
    recognized in a given text. In this paper, we evaluated a Conditional Random Fields
    classifier for the extraction of any relation descriptor occurring between named
    entities (Organisation, Person and Place categories), as well as pre-defined relation
    types between these entities in Portuguese texts.

  abstract: This work proposes an information retrieval evaluation set for the Slovak
    language. A set of 80 queries written in the natural language is given together
    with the set of relevant documents. The document set contains 3980 newspaper articles
    sorted into 6 categories. Each document in the result set is manually annotated
    for relevancy with its corresponding query. The evaluation set is mostly compatible
    with the Cranfield test collection using the same methodology for queries and
    annotation of relevancy. In addition to that it provides annotation for document
    title, author, publication date and category that can be used for evaluation of
    automatic document clustering and categorization.

  abstract: This paper proposes how to utilize a search engine in order to predict
    market shares. We propose to compare rates of concerns of those who search for
    Web pages among several companies which supply products, given a specific products
    domain. We measure concerns of those who search for Web pages through search engine
    suggests. Then, we analyze whether rates of concerns of those who search for Web
    pages have certain correlation with actual market share. We show that those statistics
    have certain correlations. We finally propose how to predict the market share
    of a specific product genre based on the rates of concerns of those who search
    for Web pages.

  abstract: Keyphrase extraction is the task of finding phrases that represent the
    important content of a document. The main aim of keyphrase extraction is to propose
    textual units that represent the most important topics developed in a document.
    The output keyphrases of automatic keyphrase extraction methods for test documents
    are typically evaluated by comparing them to manually assigned reference keyphrases.
    Each output keyphrase is considered correct if it matches one of the reference
    keyphrases. However, the choice of the appropriate textual unit (keyphrase) for
    a topic is sometimes subjective and evaluating by exact matching underestimates
    the performance. This paper presents a dataset of evaluation scores assigned to
    automatically extracted keyphrases by human evaluators. Along with the reference
    keyphrases, the manual evaluations can be used to validate new evaluation measures.
    Indeed, an evaluation measure that is highly correlated to the manual evaluation
    is appropriate for the evaluation of automatic keyphrase extraction methods.

  abstract: This article presents a corpus for development and testing of event schema
    induction systems in English. Schema induction is the task of learning templates
    with no supervision from unlabeled texts, and to group together entities corresponding
    to the same role in a template. Most of the previous work on this subject relies
    on the MUC-4 corpus. We describe the limits of using this corpus (size, non-representativeness,
    similarity of roles across templates) and propose a new, partially-annotated corpus
    in English which remedies some of these shortcomings. We make use of Wikinews
    to select the data inside the category Laws & Justice, and query Google search
    engine to retrieve different documents on the same events. Only Wikinews documents
    are manually annotated and can be used for evaluation, while the others can be
    used for unsupervised learning. We detail the methodology used for building the
    corpus and evaluate some existing systems on this new data.

  abstract: 'The current study focuses on optimization of Levenshtein algorithm for
    the purpose of computing the optimal alignment between two phoneme transcriptions
    of spoken utterance containing sequences of phonetic symbols. The alignment is
    computed with the help of a confusion matrix in which costs for phonetic symbol
    deletion, insertion and substitution are defined taking into account various phonological
    processes that occur in fluent speech, such as anticipatory assimilation, phone
    elision and epenthesis. The corpus containing about 30 hours of Russian read speech
    was used to evaluate the presented algorithms. The experimental results have shown
    significant reduction of misalignment rate in comparison with the baseline Levenshtein
    algorithm: the number of errors has been reduced from 1.1 % to 0.28 %'

  abstract: "This paper describes speech data recording, processing and annotation\
    \ of a new speech corpus CoRuSS (Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech), which\
    \ is based on connected communicative speech recorded from 60 native Russian male\
    \ and female speakers of different age groups (from 16 to 77). Some Russian speech\
    \ corpora available at the moment contain plain orthographic texts and provide\
    \ some kind of limited annotation, but there are no corpora providing detailed\
    \ prosodic annotation of spontaneous conversational speech. This corpus contains\
    \ 30 hours of high quality recorded spontaneous Russian speech, half of it has\
    \ been transcribed and prosodically labeled. The recordings consist of dialogues\
    \ between two speakers, monologues (speakers\u2019 self-presentations) and reading\
    \ of a short phonetically balanced text. Since the corpus is labeled for a wide\
    \ range of linguistic - phonetic and prosodic - information, it provides basis\
    \ for empirical studies of various spontaneous speech phenomena as well as for\
    \ comparison with those we observe in prepared read speech. Since the corpus is\
    \ designed as a open-access resource of speech data, it will also make possible\
    \ to advance corpus-based analysis of spontaneous speech data across languages\
    \ and speech technology development as well."

  abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion in the availability of large, good-quality
    cross-linguistic databases such as WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath, 2013), Glottolog
    (Hammarstrom et al., 2015) and Phoible (Moran & McCloy, 2014). Databases such
    as Phoible contain the actual segments used by various languages as they are given
    in the primary language descriptions. However, this segment-level representation
    cannot be used directly for analyses that require generalizations over classes
    of segments that share theoretically interesting features. Here we present a method
    and the associated R (R Core Team, 2014) code that allows the flexible definition
    of such meaningful classes and that can identify the sets of segments falling
    into such a class for any language inventory. The method and its results are important
    for those interested in exploring cross-linguistic patterns of phonetic and phonological
    diversity and their relationship to extra-linguistic factors and processes such
    as climate, economics, history or human genetics.

  abstract: "SEA_AP (Segmentador e Etiquetador Autom\xE1tico para An\xE1lise Pros\xF3\
    dica, Automatic Segmentation and Labelling for Prosodic Analysis) toolkit is an\
    \ application that performs audio segmentation and labelling to create a TextGrid\
    \ file which will be used to launch a prosodic analysis using Praat. In this paper,\
    \ we want to describe the improved functionality of the tool achieved by adding\
    \ a dialectometric analysis module using R scripts. The dialectometric analysis\
    \ includes computing correlations among F0 curves and it obtains prosodic distances\
    \ among the different variables of interest (location, speaker, structure, etc.).\
    \ The dialectometric analysis requires large databases in order to be adequately\
    \ computed, and automatic segmentation and labelling can create them thanks to\
    \ a procedure less costly than the manual alternative. Thus, the integration of\
    \ these tools into the SEA_AP allows to propose a distribution of geoprosodic\
    \ areas by means of a quantitative method, which completes the traditional dialectological\
    \ point of view. The current version of the SEA_AP toolkit is capable of analysing\
    \ Galician, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese data, and hence the distances between\
    \ several prosodic linguistic varieties can be measured at present."

  abstract: Vocal User Interfaces in domestic environments recently gained interest
    in the speech processing community. This interest is due to the opportunity of
    using it in the framework of Ambient Assisted Living both for home automation
    (vocal command) and for call for help in case of distress situations, i.e. after
    a fall. C IRDO X, which is a modular software, is able to analyse online the audio
    environment in a home, to extract the uttered sentences and then to process them
    thanks to an ASR module. Moreover, this system perfoms non-speech audio event
    classification; in this case, specific models must be trained. The software is
    designed to be modular and to process on-line the audio multichannel stream. Some
    exemples of studies in which C IRDO X was involved are described. They were operated
    in real environment, namely a Living lab environment.

  abstract: Computer-assisted transcription promises high-quality speech transcription
    at reduced costs. This is achieved by limiting human effort to transcribing parts
    for which automatic transcription quality is insufficient. Our goal is to improve
    the human transcription quality via appropriate user interface design. We focus
    on iterative interfaces that allow humans to solve tasks based on an initially
    given suggestion, in this case an automatic transcription. We conduct a user study
    that reveals considerable quality gains for three variations of iterative interfaces
    over a non-iterative from-scratch transcription interface. Our iterative interfaces
    included post-editing, confidence-enhanced post-editing, and a novel retyping
    interface. All three yielded similar quality on average, but we found that the
    proposed retyping interface was less sensitive to the difficulty of the segment,
    and superior when the automatic transcription of the segment contained relatively
    many errors. An analysis using mixed-effects models allows us to quantify these
    and other factors and draw conclusions over which interface design should be chosen
    in which circumstance.

  abstract: This paper introduces a new British English speech database, named the
    homeService corpus, which has been gathered as part of the homeService project.
    This project aims to help users with speech and motor disabilities to operate
    their home appliances using voice commands. The audio recorded during such interactions
    consists of realistic data of speakers with severe dysarthria. The majority of
    the homeService corpus is recorded in real home environments where voice control
    is often the normal means by which users interact with their devices. The collection
    of the corpus is motivated by the shortage of realistic dysarthric speech corpora
    available to the scientific community. Along with the details on how the data
    is organised and how it can be accessed, a brief description of the framework
    used to make the recordings is provided. Finally, the performance of the homeService
    automatic recogniser for dysarthric speech trained with single-speaker data from
    the corpus is provided as an initial baseline. Access to the homeService corpus
    is provided through the dedicated web page at http://mini.dcs.shef.ac.uk/resources/homeservice-corpus/.
    This will also have the most updated description of the data. At the time of writing
    the collection process is still ongoing.

  abstract: Perceptive evaluation of speech disorders is still the standard method
    in clinical practice for the diagnosing and the following of the condition progression
    of patients. Such methods include different tasks such as read speech, spontaneous
    speech, isolated words, sustained vowels, etc. In this context, automatic speech
    processing tools have proven pertinence in speech quality evaluation and assistive
    technology-based applications. Though, a very few studies have investigated the
    use of automatic tools on spontaneous speech. This paper investigates the behavior
    of an automatic phone-based anomaly detection system when applied on read and
    spontaneous French dysarthric speech. The behavior of the automatic tool reveals
    interesting inter-pathology differences across speech styles.

  abstract: We present a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for the dialect of Bengali
    spoken in Bangladesh. This work is part of an ongoing effort to address the needs
    of under-resourced languages. We propose a process for streamlining the bootstrapping
    of TTS systems for under-resourced languages. First, we use crowdsourcing to collect
    the data from multiple ordinary speakers, each speaker recording small amount
    of sentences. Second, we leverage an existing text normalization system for a
    related language (Hindi) to bootstrap a linguistic front-end for Bangla. Third,
    we employ statistical techniques to construct multi-speaker acoustic models using
    Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) and Hidden Markov Model
    (HMM) approaches. We then describe our experiments that show that the resulting
    TTS voices score well in terms of their perceived quality as measured by Mean
    Opinion Score (MOS) evaluations.

  abstract: "With the increasing amount of audiovisual and digital data deriving from\
    \ televisual and radiophonic sources, professional archives such as INA, France\u2019\
    s national audiovisual institute, acknowledge a growing need for efficient indexing\
    \ tools. In this paper, we describe the Speech Trax system that aims at analyzing\
    \ the audio content of TV and radio documents. In particular, we focus on the\
    \ speaker tracking task that is very valuable for indexing purposes. First, we\
    \ detail the overall architecture of the system and show the results obtained\
    \ on a large-scale experiment, the largest to our knowledge for this type of content\
    \ (about 1,300 speakers). Then, we present the Speech Trax demonstrator that gathers\
    \ the results of various automatic speech processing techniques on top of our\
    \ speaker tracking system (speaker diarization, speech transcription, etc.). Finally,\
    \ we provide insight on the obtained performances and suggest hints for future\
    \ improvements."

  abstract: In this article we propose a descriptive study of a chat conversations
    corpus from an assistance contact center. Conversations are described from several
    view points, including interaction analysis, language deviation analysis and typographic
    expressivity marks analysis. We provide in particular a detailed analysis of language
    deviations that are encountered in our corpus of 230 conversations, corresponding
    to 6879 messages and 76839 words. These deviations may be challenging for further
    syntactic and semantic parsing. Analysis is performed with a distinction between
    Customer messages and Agent messages. On the overall only 4% of the observed words
    are misspelled but 26% of the messages contain at least one erroneous word (rising
    to 40% when focused on Customer messages). Transcriptions of telephone conversations
    from an assistance call center are also studied, allowing comparisons between
    these two interaction modes to be drawn. The study reveals significant differences
    in terms of conversation flow, with an increased efficiency for chat conversations
    in spite of longer temporal span.

  abstract: "Monitoring social media has been shown to be an interesting approach\
    \ for the early detection of drug adverse effects. In this paper, we describe\
    \ a system which extracts medical entities in French drug reviews written by users.\
    \ We focus on the identification of medical conditions, which is based on the\
    \ concept of post-coordination: we first extract minimal medical-related entities\
    \ (pain, stomach) then we combine them to identify complex ones (It was the worst\
    \ [pain I ever felt in my stomach]). These two steps are respectively performed\
    \ by two classifiers, the first being based on Conditional Random Fields and the\
    \ second one on Support Vector Machines. The overall results of the minimal entity\
    \ classifier are the following: P=0.926; R=0.849; F1=0.886. A thourough analysis\
    \ of the feature set shows that, when combined with word lemmas, clusters generated\
    \ by word2vec are the most valuable features. When trained on the output of the\
    \ first classifier, the second classifier\u2019s performances are the following:\
    \ p=0.683;r=0.956;f1=0.797. The addition of post-processing rules did not add\
    \ any significant global improvement but was found to modify the precision/recall\
    \ ratio."

  abstract: In order to gain a deep understanding of how social context manifests
    in interactions, we need data that represents interactions from a large community
    of people over a long period of time, capturing different aspects of social context.
    In this paper, we present a large corpus of Wikipedia Talk page discussions that
    are collected from a broad range of topics, containing discussions that happened
    over a period of 15 years. The dataset contains 166,322 discussion threads, across
    1236 articles/topics that span 15 different topic categories or domains. The dataset
    also captures whether the post is made by an registered user or not, and whether
    he/she was an administrator at the time of making the post. It also captures the
    Wikipedia age of editors in terms of number of months spent as an editor, as well
    as their gender. This corpus will be a valuable resource to investigate a variety
    of computational sociolinguistics research questions regarding online social interactions.

  abstract: Natural Language Engineering tasks require large and complex annotated
    datasets to build more advanced models of language. Corpora are typically annotated
    by several experts to create a gold standard; however, there are now compelling
    reasons to use a non-expert crowd to annotate text, driven by cost, speed and
    scalability. Phrase Detectives Corpus 1.0 is an anaphorically-annotated corpus
    of encyclopedic and narrative text that contains a gold standard created by multiple
    experts, as well as a set of annotations created by a large non-expert crowd.
    Analysis shows very good inter-expert agreement (kappa=.88-.93) but a more variable
    baseline crowd agreement (kappa=.52-.96). Encyclopedic texts show less agreement
    (and by implication are harder to annotate) than narrative texts. The release
    of this corpus is intended to encourage research into the use of crowds for text
    annotation and the development of more advanced, probabilistic language models,
    in particular for anaphoric coreference.

  abstract: 'Despite the popularity of coreference resolution as a research topic,
    the overwhelming majority of the work in this area focused so far on single antecedence
    coreference only. Multiple antecedent coreference (MAC) has been largely neglected.
    This can be explained by the scarcity of the phenomenon of MAC in generic discourse.
    However, in specialized discourse such as patents, MAC is very dominant. It seems
    thus unavoidable to address the problem of MAC resolution in the context of tasks
    related to automatic patent material processing, among them abstractive summarization,
    deep parsing of patents, construction of concept maps of the inventions, etc.
    We present the first version of an operational rule-based MAC resolution strategy
    for patent material that covers the three major types of MAC: (i) nominal MAC,
    (ii) MAC with personal / relative pronouns, and MAC with reflexive / reciprocal
    pronouns. The evaluation shows that our strategy performs well in terms of precision
    and recall.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a second release of the ARRAU dataset: a multi-domain
    corpus with thorough linguistically motivated annotation of anaphora and related
    phenomena. Building upon the first release almost a decade ago, a considerable
    effort had been invested in improving the data both quantitatively and qualitatively.
    Thus, we have doubled the corpus size, expanded the selection of covered phenomena
    to include referentiality and genericity and designed and implemented a methodology
    for enforcing the consistency of the manual annotation. We believe that the new
    release of ARRAU provides a valuable material for ongoing research in complex
    cases of coreference as well as for a variety of related tasks. The corpus is
    publicly available through LDC.'

  abstract: "We describe a method for identifying and performing functional analysis\
    \ of structured regions that are embedded in natural language documents, such\
    \ as tables or key-value lists. Such regions often encode information according\
    \ to ad hoc schemas and avail themselves of visual cues in place of natural language\
    \ grammar, presenting problems for standard information extraction algorithms.\
    \ Unlike previous work in table extraction, which assumes a relatively noiseless\
    \ two-dimensional layout, our aim is to accommodate a wide variety of naturally\
    \ occurring structure types. Our approach has three main parts. First, we collect\
    \ and annotate a a diverse sample of \u201Cnaturally\u201D occurring structures\
    \ from several sources. Second, we use probabilistic text segmentation techniques,\
    \ featurized by skip bigrams over spatial and token category cues, to automatically\
    \ identify contiguous regions of structured text that share a common schema. Finally,\
    \ we identify the records and fields within each structured region using a combination\
    \ of distributional similarity and sequence alignment methods, guided by minimal\
    \ supervision in the form of a single annotated record. We evaluate the last two\
    \ components individually, and conclude with a discussion of further work."

  abstract: In distributional semantics words are represented by aggregated context
    features. The similarity of words can be computed by comparing their feature vectors.
    Thus, we can predict whether two words are synonymous or similar with respect
    to some other semantic relation. We will show on six different datasets of pairs
    of similar and non-similar words that a supervised learning algorithm on feature
    vectors representing pairs of words outperforms cosine similarity between vectors
    representing single words. We compared different methods to construct a feature
    vector representing a pair of words. We show that simple methods like pairwise
    addition or multiplication give better results than a recently proposed method
    that combines different types of features. The semantic relation we consider is
    relatedness of terms in thesauri for intellectual document classification. Thus
    our findings can directly be applied for the maintenance and extension of such
    thesauri. To the best of our knowledge this relation was not considered before
    in the field of distributional semantics.

  abstract: We present a proposal for the annotation of factuality of event mentions
    in Spanish texts and a free available annotated corpus. Our factuality model aims
    to capture a pragmatic notion of factuality, trying to reflect a casual reader
    judgements about the realis / irrealis status of mentioned events. Also, some
    learning experiments (SVM and CRF) have been held, showing encouraging results.

  abstract: Lately, with the success of Deep Learning techniques in some computational
    linguistics tasks, many researchers want to explore new models for their linguistics
    applications. These models tend to be very different from what standard Neural
    Networks look like, limiting the possibility to use standard Neural Networks frameworks.
    This work presents NNBlocks, a new framework written in Python to build and train
    Neural Networks that are not constrained by a specific kind of architecture, making
    it possible to use it in computational linguistics.

  abstract: This paper presents some preliminary results of the OPLON project. It
    aimed at identifying early linguistic symptoms of cognitive decline in the elderly.
    This pilot study was conducted on a corpus composed of spontaneous speech sample
    collected from 39 subjects, who underwent a neuropsychological screening for visuo-spatial
    abilities, memory, language, executive functions and attention. A rich set of
    linguistic features was extracted from the digitalised utterances (at phonetic,
    suprasegmental, lexical, morphological and syntactic levels) and the statistical
    significance in pinpointing the pathological process was measured. Our results
    show remarkable trends for what concerns both the linguistic traits selection
    and the automatic classifiers building.

  abstract: "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition\
    \ that would benefit from low-cost and reliable improvements to screening and\
    \ diagnosis. Human language technologies (HLTs) provide one possible route to\
    \ automating a series of subjective decisions that currently inform \u201CGold\
    \ Standard\u201D diagnosis based on clinical judgment. In this paper, we describe\
    \ a new resource to support this goal, comprised of 100 20-minute semi-structured\
    \ English language samples labeled with child age, sex, IQ, autism symptom severity,\
    \ and diagnostic classification. We assess the feasibility of digitizing and processing\
    \ sensitive clinical samples for data sharing, and identify areas of difficulty.\
    \ Using the methods described here, we propose to join forces with researchers\
    \ and clinicians throughout the world to establish an international repository\
    \ of annotated language samples from individuals with ASD and related disorders.\
    \ This project has the potential to improve the lives of individuals with ASD\
    \ and their families by identifying linguistic features that could improve remote\

    suffering from language disabilities and non-native learners of Arabic language
    to classify Arabic continuous speech to pathological or healthy and to identify
    phonemes that pose pronunciation problems (case of pathological speeches). The
    main idea can be summarized in comparing between the phonetic model reference
    to Arabic spoken language and that proper to concerned speaker. For this task,
    we use techniques of automatic speech processing like forced alignment and artificial
    neural network (ANN) (Basheer, 2000). Based on a test corpus containing 100 speech
    sequences, recorded by different speakers (healthy/pathological speeches and native/foreign
    speakers), we attain 97% as classification rate. Algorithms used in identifying
    phonemes that pose pronunciation problems show high efficiency: we attain an identification
    rate of 100%.'

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate a covert labeling cue, namely the probability
    that a title (by example of the Wikipedia titles) is a noun. If this probability
    is very large, any list such as or comparable to the Wikipedia titles can be used
    as a reliable word-class (or part-of-speech tag) predictor or noun lexicon. This
    may be especially useful in the case of Low Resource Languages (LRL) where labeled
    data is lacking and putatively for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such
    as Word Sense Disambiguation, Sentiment Analysis and Machine Translation. Profitting
    from the ease of digital publication on the web as opposed to print, LRL speaker
    communities produce resources such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary, which can be used
    for an assessment. We provide statistical evidence for a strong noun bias for
    the Wikipedia titles from 2 corpora (English, Persian) and a dictionary (Japanese)
    and for a typologically balanced set of 17 languages including LRLs. Additionally,
    we conduct a small experiment on predicting noun tags for out-of-vocabulary items
    in part-of-speech tagging for English.

  abstract: "Although some words carry strong associations with specific colors (e.g.,\
    \ the word danger is associated with the color red), few studies have investigated\
    \ these relationships. This may be due to the relative rarity of databases that\
    \ contain large quantities of such information. Additionally, these resources\
    \ are often limited to particular languages, such as English. Moreover, the existing\
    \ resources often do not consider the possible contexts of words in assessing\
    \ the associations between a word and a color. As a result, the influence of context\
    \ on word\u2015color associations is not fully understood. In this study, we constructed\
    \ a novel language resource for word\u2015color associations. The resource has\
    \ two characteristics: First, our resource is the first to include Japanese word\u2015\
    color associations, which were collected via crowdsourcing. Second, the word\u2015\
    color associations in the resource are linked to contexts. We show that word\u2015\
    color associations depend on language and that associations with certain colors\
    \ are affected by context information."

  abstract: This paper presents a collection of annotations (tags or keywords) for
    a set of 2,133 environmental sounds taken from the Freesound database (www.freesound.org).
    The annotations are acquired through an open-ended crowd-labeling task, in which
    participants were asked to provide keywords for each of three sounds. The main
    goal of this study is to find out (i) whether it is feasible to collect keywords
    for a large collection of sounds through crowdsourcing, and (ii) how people talk
    about sounds, and what information they can infer from hearing a sound in isolation.
    Our main finding is that it is not only feasible to perform crowd-labeling for
    a large collection of sounds, it is also very useful to highlight different aspects
    of the sounds that authors may fail to mention. Our data is freely available,
    and can be used to ground semantic models, improve search in audio databases,
    and to study the language of sound.

  abstract: We present a new large dataset of 12403 context-sensitive verb relations
    manually annotated via crowdsourcing. These relations capture fine-grained semantic
    information between verb-centric propositions, such as temporal or entailment
    relations. We propose a novel semantic verb relation scheme and design a multi-step
    annotation approach for scaling-up the annotations using crowdsourcing. We employ
    several quality measures and report on agreement scores. The resulting dataset
    is available under a permissive CreativeCommons license at www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/verb-relations/.
    It represents a valuable resource for various applications, such as automatic
    information consolidation or automatic summarization.

  abstract: 'We describe an experiment for the acquisition of opposition relations
    among Italian verb senses, based on a crowdsourcing methodology. The goal of the
    experiment is to discuss whether the types of opposition we distinguish (i.e.
    complementarity, antonymy, converseness and reversiveness) are actually perceived
    by the crowd. In particular, we collect data for Italian by using the crowdsourcing
    platform CrowdFlower. We ask annotators to judge the type of opposition existing
    among pairs of sentences -previously judged as opposite- that differ only for
    a verb: the verb in the first sentence is opposite of the verb in second sentence.
    Data corroborate the hypothesis that some opposition relations exclude each other,
    while others interact, being recognized as compatible by the contributors.'

  abstract: 'We announce the release of the CROWDED CORPUS: a pair of speech corpora
    collected via crowdsourcing, containing a native speaker corpus of English (CROWDED_ENGLISH),
    and a corpus of German/English bilinguals (CROWDED_BILINGUAL). Release 1 of the
    CROWDED CORPUS contains 1000 recordings amounting to 33,400 tokens collected from
    80 speakers and is freely available to other researchers. We recruited participants
    via the Crowdee application for Android. Recruits were prompted to respond to
    business-topic questions of the type found in language learning oral tests. We
    then used the CrowdFlower web application to pass these recordings to crowdworkers
    for transcription and annotation of errors and sentence boundaries. Finally, the
    sentences were tagged and parsed using standard natural language processing tools.
    We propose that crowdsourcing is a valid and economical method for corpus collection,
    and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.'

  abstract: Crowdsourcing is an arising collaborative approach applicable among many
    other applications to the area of language and speech processing. In fact, the
    use of crowdsourcing was already applied in the field of speech processing with
    promising results. However, only few studies investigated the use of crowdsourcing
    in computational paralinguistics. In this contribution, we propose a novel evaluator
    for crowdsourced-based ratings termed Weighted Trustability Evaluator (WTE) which
    is computed from the rater-dependent consistency over the test questions. We further
    investigate the reliability of crowdsourced annotations as compared to the ones
    obtained with traditional labelling procedures, such as constrained listening
    experiments in laboratories or in controlled environments. This comparison includes
    an in-depth analysis of obtainable classification performances. The experiments
    were conducted on the Speaker Likability Database (SLD) already used in the INTERSPEECH
    Challenge 2012, and the results lend further weight to the assumption that crowdsourcing
    can be applied as a reliable annotation source for computational paralinguistics
    given a sufficient number of raters and suited measurements of their reliability.

  abstract: "In online computer-mediated communication, speakers were considered to\
    \ have experienced difficulties in catching their partner\u2019s emotions and\
    \ in conveying their own emotions. To explain why online emotional communication\
    \ is so difficult and to investigate how this problem should be solved, multimodal\
    \ online emotional communication corpus was constructed by recording approximately\
    \ 100 speakers\u2019 emotional expressions and reactions in a modality-controlled\
    \ environment. Speakers communicated over the Internet using video chat, voice\
    \ chat or text chat; their face-to-face conversations were used for comparison\
    \ purposes. The corpora incorporated emotional labels by evaluating the speaker\u2019\
    s dynamic emotional states and the measurements of the speaker\u2019s facial expression,\
    \ vocal expression and autonomic nervous system activity. For the initial study\
    \ of this project, which used a large-scale emotional communication corpus, the\
    \ accuracy of online emotional understanding was assessed to demonstrate the emotional\
    \ labels evaluated by the speakers and to summarize the speaker\u2019s answers\
    \ on the questionnaire regarding the difference between an online chat and face-to-face\
    \ conversations in which they actually participated. The results revealed that\
    \ speakers have difficulty communicating their emotions in online communication\
    \ environments, regardless of the type of communication modality and that inaccurate\
    \ emotional understanding occurs more frequently in online computer-mediated communication\
    \ than in face-to-face communication."

  abstract: This paper presents a quantitative description of laughter in height 1-hour
    French spontaneous conversations. The paper includes the raw figures for laughter
    as well as more details concerning inter-individual variability. It firstly describes
    to what extent the amount of laughter and their durations varies from speaker
    to speaker in all dialogs. In a second suite of analyses, this paper compares
    our corpus with previous analyzed corpora. In a final set of experiments, it presents
    some facts about overlapping laughs. This paper have quantified these all effects
    in free-style conversations, for the first time.

  abstract: Emotional aspects play a vital role in making human communication a rich
    and dynamic experience. As we introduce more automated system in our daily lives,
    it becomes increasingly important to incorporate emotion to provide as natural
    an interaction as possible. To achieve said incorporation, rich sets of labeled
    emotional data is prerequisite. However, in Japanese, existing emotion database
    is still limited to unimodal and bimodal corpora. Since emotion is not only expressed
    through speech, but also visually at the same time, it is essential to include
    multiple modalities in an observation. In this paper, we present the first audio-visual
    emotion corpora in Japanese, collected from 14 native speakers. The corpus contains
    100 minutes of annotated and transcribed material. We performed preliminary emotion
    recognition experiments on the corpus and achieved an accuracy of 61.42% for five
    classes of emotion.

  abstract: "In this paper we compare different context selection approaches to improve\
    \ the creation of Emotive Vector Space Models (VSMs). The system is based on the\
    \ results of an existing approach that showed the possibility to create and update\
    \ VSMs by exploiting crowdsourcing and human annotation. Here, we introduce a\
    \ method to manipulate the contexts of the VSMs under the assumption that the\
    \ emotive connotation of a target word is a function of both its syntagmatic and\
    \ paradigmatic association with the various emotions. To study the differences\
    \ among the proposed spaces and to confirm the reliability of the system, we report\
    \ on two experiments: in the first one we validated the best candidates extracted\
    \ from each model, and in the second one we compared the models\u2019 performance\
    \ on a random sample of target words. Both experiments have been implemented as\
    \ crowdsourcing tasks."

  abstract: Sentence alignment is a task that consists in aligning the parallel sentences
    in a translated article pair. This paper describes a method to perform sentence
    boundary detection and alignment simultaneously, which significantly improves
    the alignment accuracy on languages like Chinese with uncertain sentence boundaries.
    It relies on the definition of hard (certain) and soft (uncertain) punctuation
    delimiters, the latter being possibly ignored to optimize the alignment result.
    The alignment method is used in combination with lexicons automatically generated
    from the input article pairs using pivot-based MT, achieving better coverage of
    the input words with fewer entries than pre-existing dictionaries. Pivot-based
    MT makes it possible to build dictionaries for language pairs that have scarce
    parallel data. The alignment method is implemented in a tool that will be freely
    available in the near future.

  abstract: "Parallel corpora are often injected with bilingual lexical resources\
    \ for improved Indian language machine translation (MT). In absence of such lexical\
    \ resources, multilingual topic models have been used to create coarse lexical\
    \ resources in the past, using a Cartesian product approach. Our results show\
    \ that for morphologically rich languages like Hindi, the Cartesian product approach\
    \ is detrimental for MT. We then present a novel \u2018sentential\u2019 approach\
    \ to use this coarse lexical resource from a multilingual topic model. Our coarse\
    \ lexical resource when injected with a parallel corpus outperforms a system trained\
    \ using parallel corpus and a good quality lexical resource. As demonstrated by\
    \ the quality of our coarse lexical resource and its benefit to MT, we believe\
    \ that our sentential approach to create such a resource will help MT for resource-constrained\
    \ languages."

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the details of the ASPEC (Asian Scientific
    Paper Excerpt Corpus), which is the first large-size parallel corpus of scientific
    paper domain. ASPEC was constructed in the Japanese-Chinese machine translation
    project conducted between 2006 and 2010 using the Special Coordination Funds for
    Promoting Science and Technology. It consists of a Japanese-English scientific
    paper abstract corpus of approximately 3 million parallel sentences (ASPEC-JE)
    and a Chinese-Japanese scientific paper excerpt corpus of approximately 0.68 million
    parallel sentences (ASPEC-JC). ASPEC is used as the official dataset for the machine
    translation evaluation workshop WAT (Workshop on Asian Translation).

  abstract: 'This paper presents how an state-of-the-art SMT system is enriched by
    using an extra in-domain parallel corpora extracted from Wikipedia. We collect
    corpora from parallel titles and from parallel fragments in comparable articles
    from Wikipedia. We carried out an evaluation with a double objective: evaluating
    the quality of the extracted data and evaluating the improvement due to the domain-adaptation.
    We think this can be very useful for languages with limited amount of parallel
    corpora, where in-domain data is crucial to improve the performance of MT sytems.
    The experiments on the Spanish-English language pair improve a baseline trained
    with the Europarl corpus in more than 2 points of BLEU when translating in the
    Computer Science domain.'

  abstract: "This paper presents ProphetMT, a tree-based SMT-driven Controlled Language\
    \ (CL) authoring and post-editing tool. ProphetMT employs the source-side rules\
    \ in a translation model and provides them as auto-suggestions to users. Accordingly,\
    \ one might say that users are writing in a Controlled Language that is understood\
    \ by the computer. ProphetMT also allows users to easily attach structural information\
    \ as they compose content. When a specific rule is selected, a partial translation\
    \ is promptly generated on-the-fly with the help of the structural information.\
    \ Our experiments conducted on English-to-Chinese show that our proposed ProphetMT\
    \ system can not only better regularise an author\u2019s writing behaviour, but\
    \ also significantly improve translation fluency which is vital to reduce the\
    \ post-editing time. Additionally, when the writing and translation process is\
    \ over, ProphetMT can provide an effective colour scheme to further improve the\
    \ productivity of post-editors by explicitly featuring the relations between the\
    \ source and target rules."

  abstract: Bilingual lexica are the basis for many cross-lingual natural language
    processing tasks. Recent works have shown success in learning bilingual dictionary
    by taking advantages of comparable corpora and a diverse set of signals derived
    from monolingual corpora. In the present work, we describe an approach to automatically
    learn bilingual lexica by training a supervised classifier using word embedding-based
    vectors of only a few hundred translation equivalent word pairs. The word embedding
    representations of translation pairs were obtained from source and target monolingual
    corpora, which are not necessarily related. Our classifier is able to predict
    whether a new word pair is under a translation relation or not. We tested it on
    two quite distinct language pairs Chinese-Spanish and English-Spanish. The classifiers
    achieved more than 0.90 precision and recall for both language pairs in different
    evaluation scenarios. These results show a high potential for this method to be
    used in bilingual lexica production for language pairs with reduced amount of
    parallel or comparable corpora, in particular for phrase table expansion in Statistical
    Machine Translation systems.

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce a coverage-based scoring function that discriminates
    between parallel and non-parallel sentences. When plugged into Bleualign, a state-of-the-art
    sentence aligner, our function improves both precision and recall of alignments
    over the originally proposed BLEU score. Furthermore, since our scoring function
    uses Moses phrase tables directly we avoid the need to translate the texts to
    be aligned, which is time-consuming and a potential source of alignment errors.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a solution to evaluate spoken post-editing of imperfect
    machine translation output by a human translator. We compare two approaches to
    the combination of machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR):
    a heuristic algorithm and a machine learning method. To obtain a data set with
    spoken post-editing information, we use the French version of TED talks as the
    source texts submitted to MT, and the spoken English counterparts as their corrections,
    which are submitted to an ASR system. We experiment with various levels of artificial
    ASR noise and also with a state-of-the-art ASR system. The results show that the
    combination of MT with ASR improves over both individual outputs of MT and ASR
    in terms of BLEU scores, especially when ASR performance is low.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents our work towards a novel approach for Quality Estimation
    (QE) of machine translation based on sequences of adjacent words, the so-called
    phrases. This new level of QE aims to provide a natural balance between QE at
    word and sentence-level, which are either too fine grained or too coarse levels
    for some applications. However, phrase-level QE implies an intrinsic challenge:
    how to segment a machine translation into sequence of words (contiguous or not)
    that represent an error. We discuss three possible segmentation strategies to
    automatically extract erroneous phrases. We evaluate these strategies against
    annotations at phrase-level produced by humans, using a new dataset collected

  abstract: 'This paper describes a pilot study in lexical encoding of multi-word
    expressions (MWEs) in 4 Latin American dialects of Spanish: Costa Rican, Colombian,
    Mexican and Peruvian. We describe the variability of MWE usage across dialects.
    We adapt an existing data model to a dialect-aware encoding, so as to represent
    dialect-related specificities, while avoiding redundancy of the data common for
    all dialects. A dozen of linguistic properties of MWEs can be expressed in this
    model, both on the level of a whole MWE and of its individual components. We describe
    the resulting lexical resource containing several dozens of MWEs in four dialects
    and we propose a method for constructing a web corpus as a support for crowdsourcing
    examples of MWE occurrences. The resource is available under an open license and
    paves the way towards a large-scale dialect-aware language resource construction,
    which should prove useful in both traditional and novel NLP applications.'

  abstract: 'Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) or Recognition (ATR) is a fundamental
    processing step preceding many complex knowledge engineering tasks. However, few
    methods have been implemented as public tools and in particular, available as
    open-source freeware. Further, little effort is made to develop an adaptable and
    scalable framework that enables customization, development, and comparison of
    algorithms under a uniform environment. This paper introduces JATE 2.0, a complete
    remake of the free Java Automatic Term Extraction Toolkit (Zhang et al., 2008)
    delivering new features including: (1) highly modular, adaptable and scalable
    ATE thanks to integration with Apache Solr, the open source free-text indexing
    and search platform; (2) an extended collection of state-of-the-art algorithms.
    We carry out experiments on two well-known benchmarking datasets and compare the
    algorithms along the dimensions of effectiveness (precision) and efficiency (speed
    and memory consumption). To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the only
    free ATE library offering a flexible architecture and the most comprehensive collection
    of algorithms.'

  abstract: Synaesthesia is a type of metaphor associating linguistic expressions
    that refer to two different sensory modalities. Previous studies, based on the
    analysis of poetic texts, have shown that synaesthetic transfers tend to go from
    the lower toward the higher senses (e.g., sweet music vs. musical sweetness).
    In non-literary language synaesthesia is rare, and finding a sufficient number
    of examples manually would be too time-consuming. In order to verify whether the
    directionality also holds for conventional synaesthesia found in non-literary
    texts, an automatic procedure for the identification of instances of synaesthesia
    is therefore highly desirable. In this paper, we first focus on the preliminary
    step of this procedure, that is, the creation of a controlled lexicon of perception.
    Next, we present the results of a small pilot study that applies the extraction
    procedure to English and Italian corpus data.

  abstract: "The purpose of this paper is to introduce the TermoPL tool created to\
    \ extract terminology from domain corpora in Polish. The program extracts noun\
    \ phrases, term candidates, with the help of a simple grammar that can be adapted\
    \ for user\u2019s needs. It applies the C-value method to rank term candidates\
    \ being either the longest identified nominal phrases or their nested subphrases.\
    \ The method operates on simplified base forms in order to unify morphological\
    \ variants of terms and to recognize their contexts. We support the recognition\
    \ of nested terms by word connection strength which allows us to eliminate truncated\
    \ phrases from the top part of the term list. The program has an option to convert\
    \ simplified forms of phrases into correct phrases in the nominal case. TermoPL\
    \ accepts as input morphologically annotated and disambiguated domain texts and\
    \ creates a list of terms, the top part of which comprises domain terminology.\
    \ It can also compare two candidate term lists using three different coefficients\
    \ showing asymmetry of term occurrences in this data."

  abstract: This paper summarizes the preliminary results of an ongoing survey on
    multiword resources carried out within the IC1207 Cost Action PARSEME (PARSing
    and Multi-word Expressions). Despite the availability of language resource catalogs
    and the inventory of multiword datasets on the SIGLEX-MWE website, multiword resources
    are scattered and difficult to find. In many cases, language resources such as
    corpora, treebanks, or lexical databases include multiwords as part of their data
    or take them into account in their annotations. However, these resources need
    to be centralized to make them accessible. The aim of this survey is to create
    a portal where researchers can easily find multiword(-aware) language resources
    for their research. We report on the design of the survey and analyze the data
    gathered so far. We also discuss the problems we have detected upon examination
    of the data as well as possible ways of enhancing the survey.

  abstract: The goal of this work is to introduce CHILDES-MWE, which contains English
    CHILDES corpora automatically annotated with Multiword Expressions (MWEs) information.
    The result is a resource with almost 350,000 sentences annotated with more than
    70,000 distinct MWEs of various types from both longitudinal and latitudinal corpora.
    This resource can be used for large scale language acquisition studies of how
    MWEs feature in child language. Focusing on compound nouns (CN), we then verify
    in a longitudinal study if there are differences in the distribution and compositionality
    of CNs in child-directed and child-produced sentences across ages. Moreover, using
    additional latitudinal data, we investigate if there are further differences in
    CN usage and in compositionality preferences. The results obtained for the child-produced
    sentences reflect CN distribution and compositionality in child-directed sentences.

  abstract: While measuring the readability of texts has been a long-standing research
    topic, assessing the technicality of terms has only been addressed more recently
    and mostly for the English language. In this paper, we train a learning-to-rank
    model to determine a specialization degree for each term found in a given list.
    Since no training data for this task exist for French, we train our system with
    non-lexical features on English data, namely, the Consumer Health Vocabulary,
    then apply it to French. The features include the likelihood ratio of the term
    based on specialized and lay language models, and tests for containing morphologically
    complex words. The evaluation of this approach is conducted on 134 terms from
    the UMLS Metathesaurus and 868 terms from the Eugloss thesaurus. The Normalized
    Discounted Cumulative Gain obtained by our system is over 0.8 on both test sets.
    Besides, thanks to the learning-to-rank approach, adding morphological features
    to the language model features improves the results on the Eugloss thesaurus.

  abstract: "Collocations such as \u201Cheavy rain\u201D or \u201Cmake [a] decision\u201D\
    , are combinations of two elements where one (the base) is freely chosen, while\
    \ the choice of the other (collocate) is restricted, depending on the base. Collocations\
    \ present difficulties even to advanced language learners, who usually struggle\
    \ to find the right collocate to express a particular meaning, e.g., both \u201C\
    heavy\u201D and \u201Cstrong\u201D express the meaning \u2018intense\u2019, but\
    \ while \u201Crain\u201D selects \u201Cheavy\u201D, \u201Cwind\u201D selects \u201C\
    strong\u201D. Lexical Functions (LFs) describe the meanings that hold between\
    \ the elements of collocations, such as \u2018intense\u2019, \u2018perform\u2019\
    , \u2018create\u2019, \u2018increase\u2019, etc. Language resources with semantically\
    \ classified collocations would be of great help for students, however they are\
    \ expensive to build, since they are manually constructed, and scarce. We present\
    \ an unsupervised approach to the acquisition and semantic classification of collocations\
    \ according to LFs, based on word embeddings in which, given an example of a collocation\
    \ for each of the target LFs and a set of bases, the system retrieves a list of\
    \ collocates for each base and LF."

  abstract: 'By means of an online survey, we have investigated ways in which various
    types of multiword expressions are annotated in existing treebanks. The results
    indicate that there is considerable variation in treatments across treebanks and
    thereby also, to some extent, across languages and across theoretical frameworks.
    The comparison is focused on the annotation of light verb constructions and verbal
    idioms. The survey shows that the light verb constructions either get special
    annotations as such, or are treated as ordinary verbs, while VP idioms are handled
    through different strategies. Based on insights from our investigation, we propose
    some general guidelines for annotating multiword expressions in treebanks. The
    recommendations address the following application-based needs: distinguishing
    MWEs from similar but compositional constructions; searching distinct types of
    MWEs in treebanks; awareness of literal and nonliteral meanings; and normalization
    of the MWE representation. The cross-lingually and cross-theoretically focused
    survey is intended as an aid to accessing treebanks and an aid for further work
    on treebank annotation.'

  abstract: 'Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are used frequently in natural languages,
    but understanding the diversity in MWEs is one of the open problem in the area
    of Natural Language Processing. In the context of Indian languages, MWEs play
    an important role. In this paper, we present MWEs annotation dataset created for
    Indian languages viz., Hindi and Marathi. We extract possible MWE candidates using
    two repositories: 1) the POS-tagged corpus and 2) the IndoWordNet synsets. Annotation
    is done for two types of MWEs: compound nouns and light verb constructions. In
    the process of annotation, human annotators tag valid MWEs from these candidates
    based on the standard guidelines provided to them. We obtained 3178 compound nouns
    and 2556 light verb constructions in Hindi and 1003 compound nouns and 2416 light
    verb constructions in Marathi using two repositories mentioned before. This created
    resource is made available publicly and can be used as a gold standard for Hindi
    and Marathi MWE systems.'

  abstract: The question of how to compare languages and more generally the domain
    of linguistic typology, relies on the study of different linguistic properties
    or phenomena. Classically, such a comparison is done semi-manually, for example
    by extracting information from databases such as the WALS. However, it remains
    difficult to identify precisely regular parameters, available for different languages,
    that can be used as a basis towards modeling. We propose in this paper, focusing
    on the question of syntactic typology, a method for automatically extracting such
    parameters from treebanks, bringing them into a typology perspective. We present
    the method and the tools for inferring such information and navigating through
    the treebanks. The approach has been applied to 10 languages of the Universal
    Dependencies Treebank. We approach is evaluated by showing how automatic classification
    correlates with language families.

  abstract: "This paper introduces EasyTree, a dynamic graphical tool for dependency\
    \ tree annotation. Built in JavaScript using the popular D3 data visualization\
    \ library, EasyTree allows annotators to construct and label trees entirely by\
    \ manipulating graphics, and then export the corresponding data in JSON format.\
    \ Human users are thus able to annotate in an intuitive way without compromising\
    \ the machine-compatibility of the output. EasyTree has a number of features to\
    \ assist annotators, including color-coded part-of-speech indicators and optional\
    \ translation displays. It can also be customized to suit a wide range of projects;\
    \ part-of-speech categories, edge labels, and many other settings can be edited\
    \ from within the GUI. The system also utilizes UTF-8 encoding and properly handles\
    \ both left-to-right and right-to-left scripts. By providing a user-friendly annotation\
    \ tool, we aim to reduce time spent transforming data or learning to use the software,\
    \ to improve the user experience for annotators, and to make annotation approachable\
    \ even for inexperienced users. Unlike existing solutions, EasyTree is built entirely\
    \ with standard web technologies\u2013JavaScript, HTML, and CSS\u2013making it\
    \ ideal for web-based annotation efforts, including crowdsourcing efforts."

  abstract: 'Wikipedia, the well known internet encyclopedia, is nowadays a widely
    used source of information. To leverage its rich information, already parsed versions
    of Wikipedia have been proposed. We present an annotated dump of the English Wikipedia.
    This dump draws upon previously released Wikipedia parsed dumps. Still, we head
    in a different direction. In this parse we focus more into the syntactical characteristics
    of words: aside from the classical Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags and dependency parsing
    relations, we provide the full constituent parse branch for each word in a succinct
    way. Additionally, we propose a hypergraph network representation of the extracted
    linguistic information. The proposed modelization aims to take advantage of the
    information stocked within our parsed Wikipedia dump. We hope that by releasing
    these resources, researchers from the concerned communities will have a ready-to-experiment
    Wikipedia corpus to compare and distribute their work. We render public our parsed
    Wikipedia dump as well as the tool (and its source code) used to perform the parse.
    The hypergraph network and its related metadata is also distributed.'

  abstract: To ensure portability of NLP systems across multiple domains, existing
    treebanks are often extended by adding trees from interesting domains that were
    not part of the initial annotation effort. In this paper, we will argue that it
    is both useful from an application viewpoint and enlightening from a linguistic
    viewpoint to detect and reduce divergence in annotation schemes between extant
    and new parts in a set of treebanks that is to be used in evaluation experiments.
    The results of our correction and harmonization efforts will be made available
    to the public as a test suite for the evaluation of constituent parsing.

  abstract: The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (Persian UD) is a recent effort
    of treebanking Persian with Universal Dependencies (UD), an ongoing project that
    designs unified and cross-linguistically valid grammatical representations including
    part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency relations. The Persian
    UD is the converted version of the Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank (UPDT)
    to the universal dependencies framework and consists of nearly 6,000 sentences
    and 152,871 word tokens with an average sentence length of 25 words. In addition
    to the universal dependencies syntactic annotation guidelines, the two treebanks
    differ in tokenization. All words containing unsegmented clitics (pronominal and
    copula clitics) annotated with complex labels in the UPDT have been separated
    from the clitics and appear with distinct labels in the Persian UD. The treebank
    has its original syntactic annotation scheme based on Stanford Typed Dependencies.
    In this paper, we present the approaches taken in the development of the Persian
    UD.

  abstract: Many shallow natural language understanding tasks use dependency trees
    to extract relations between content words. However, strict surface-structure
    dependency trees tend to follow the linguistic structure of sentences too closely
    and frequently fail to provide direct relations between content words. To mitigate
    this problem, the original Stanford Dependencies representation also defines two
    dependency graph representations which contain additional and augmented relations
    that explicitly capture otherwise implicit relations between content words. In
    this paper, we revisit and extend these dependency graph representations in light
    of the recent Universal Dependencies (UD) initiative and provide a detailed account
    of an enhanced and an enhanced++ English UD representation. We further present
    a converter from constituency to basic, i.e., strict surface structure, UD trees,
    and a converter from basic UD trees to enhanced and enhanced++ English UD graphs.
    We release both converters as part of Stanford CoreNLP and the Stanford Parser.

  abstract: This paper describes our efforts for the development of a Proposition
    Bank for Urdu, an Indo-Aryan language. Our primary goal is the labeling of syntactic
    nodes in the existing Urdu dependency Treebank with specific argument labels.
    In essence, it involves annotation of predicate argument structures of both simple
    and complex predicates in the Treebank corpus. We describe the overall process
    of building the PropBank of Urdu. We discuss various statistics pertaining to
    the Urdu PropBank and the issues which the annotators encountered while developing
    the PropBank. We also discuss how these challenges were addressed to successfully
    expand the PropBank corpus. While reporting the Inter-annotator agreement between
    the two annotators, we show that the annotators share similar understanding of
    the annotation guidelines and of the linguistic phenomena present in the language.
    The present size of this Propbank is around 180,000 tokens which is double-propbanked
    by the two annotators for simple predicates. Another 100,000 tokens have been
    annotated for complex predicates of Urdu.

  abstract: We introduce a new member of the family of Prague dependency treebanks.
    The Czech Legal Text Treebank 1.0 is a morphologically and syntactically annotated
    corpus of 1,128 sentences. The treebank contains texts from the legal domain,
    namely the documents from the Collection of Laws of the Czech Republic. Legal
    texts differ from other domains in several language phenomena influenced by rather
    high frequency of very long sentences. A manual annotation of such sentences presents
    a new challenge. We describe a strategy and tools for this task. The resulting
    treebank can be explored in various ways. It can be downloaded from the LINDAT/CLARIN
    repository and viewed locally using the TrEd editor or it can be accessed on-line
    using the KonText and TreeQuery tools.

  abstract: We present an attempt to link the large amount of different concept lists
    which are used in the linguistic literature, ranging from Swadesh lists in historical
    linguistics to naming tests in clinical studies and psycholinguistics. This resource,
    our Concepticon, links 30 222 concept labels from 160 conceptlists to 2495 concept
    sets. Each concept set is given a unique identifier, a unique label, and a human-readable
    definition. Concept sets are further structured by defining different relations
    between the concepts. The resource can be used for various purposes. Serving as
    a rich reference for new and existing databases in diachronic and synchronic linguistics,
    it allows researchers a quick access to studies on semantic change, cross-linguistic
    polysemies, and semantic associations.

  abstract: In knowledge bases where concepts have associated properties, there is
    a large amount of comparative information that is implicitly encoded in the values
    of the properties these concepts share. Although there have been previous approaches
    to generating riddles, none of them seem to take advantage of structured information
    stored in knowledge bases such as Thesaurus Rex, which organizes concepts according
    to the fine grained ad-hoc categories they are placed into by speakers in everyday
    language, along with associated properties or modifiers. Taking advantage of these
    shared properties, we have developed a riddle generator that creates riddles about
    concepts represented as common nouns. The base of these riddles are comparisons
    between the target concept and other entities that share some of its properties.
    In this paper, we describe the process we have followed to generate the riddles
    starting from the target concept and we show the results of the first evaluation
    we have carried out to test the quality of the resulting riddles.

  abstract: 'The paper presents the strategy and results of mapping adjective synsets
    between plWordNet (the wordnet of Polish, cf. Piasecki et al. 2009, Maziarz et
    al. 2013) and Princeton WordNet (cf. Fellbaum 1998). The main challenge of this
    enterprise has been very different synset relation structures in the two networks:
    horizontal, dumbbell-model based in PWN and vertical, hyponymy-based in plWN.
    Moreover, the two wordnets display differences in the grouping of adjectives into
    semantic domains and in the size of the adjective category. The handle the above
    contrasts, a series of automatic prompt algorithms and a manual mapping procedure
    relying on corresponding synset and lexical unit relations as well as on inter-lingual
    relations between noun synsets were proposed in the pilot stage of mapping (Rudnicka
    et al. 2015). In the paper we discuss the final results of the mapping process
    as well as explain example mapping choices. Suggestions for further development
    of mapping are also given.'

  abstract: Recent research shows the importance of linking linguistic knowledge resources
    for the creation of large-scale linguistic data. We describe our approach for
    combining two English resources, FrameNet and sar-graphs, and illustrate the benefits
    of the linked data in a relation extraction setting. While FrameNet consists of
    schematic representations of situations, linked to lexemes and their valency patterns,
    sar-graphs are knowledge resources that connect semantic relations from factual
    knowledge graphs to the linguistic phrases used to express instances of these
    relations. We analyze the conceptual similarities and differences of both resources
    and propose to link sar-graphs and FrameNet on the levels of relations/frames
    as well as phrases. The former alignment involves a manual ontology mapping step,
    which allows us to extend sar-graphs with new phrase patterns from FrameNet. The
    phrase-level linking, on the other hand, is fully automatic. We investigate the
    quality of the automatically constructed links and identify two main classes of
    errors.

  abstract: Wikipedia has been increasingly used as a knowledge base for open-domain
    Named Entity Linking and Disambiguation. In this task, a dictionary with entity
    surface forms plays an important role in finding a set of candidate entities for
    the mentions in text. Existing dictionaries mostly rely on the Wikipedia link
    structure, like anchor texts, redirect links and disambiguation links. In this
    paper, we introduce a dictionary for Entity Linking that includes name variations
    extracted from Wikipedia article text, in addition to name variations derived
    from the Wikipedia link structure. With this approach, we show an increase in
    the coverage of entities and their mentions in the dictionary in comparison to
    other Wikipedia based dictionaries.

    from various fields of linguistics, natural language processing, and information
    technology to present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices
    for representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections. A major
    outcome of our work is the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud, an LOD (sub-)cloud
    of linguistic resources, which covers various linguistic databases, lexicons,
    corpora, terminologies, and metadata repositories. We present and summarize five
    years of progress on the development of the cloud and of advancements in open
    data in linguistics, and we describe recent community activities. The paper aims
    to serve as a guideline to orient and involve researchers with the community and/or
    Linguistic Linked Open Data.

  abstract: 'Various lexical resources are being published in RDF. To enhance the
    usability of these resources, identical resources in different data sets should
    be linked. If lexical resources are described in different natural languages,
    then techniques to deal with multilinguality are required for interlinking. In
    this paper, we evaluate machine translation for interlinking concepts, i.e., generic
    entities named with a common noun or term. In our previous work, the evaluated
    method has been applied on named entities. We conduct two experiments involving
    different thesauri in different languages. The first experiment involves concepts
    from the TheSoz multilingual thesaurus in three languages: English, French and
    German. The second experiment involves concepts from the EuroVoc and AGROVOC thesauri
    in English and Chinese respectively. Our results demonstrate that machine translation
    can be beneficial for cross-lingual thesauri interlinking independently of a dataset
    structure.'

  abstract: Language Resources (LRs) are an essential ingredient of current approaches
    in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Language Technology and related fields.
    LRs are collections of spoken or written language data, typically annotated with
    linguistic analysis information. Different types of LRs exist, for example, corpora,
    ontologies, lexicons, collections of spoken language data (audio), or collections
    that also include video (multimedia, multimodal). Often, LRs are distributed with
    specific tools, documentation, manuals or research publications. The different
    phases that involve creating and distributing an LR can be conceptualised as a
    life cycle. While the idea of handling the LR production and maintenance process
    in terms of a life cycle has been brought up quite some time ago, a best practice
    model or common approach can still be considered a research gap. This article
    wants to help fill this gap by proposing an initial version of a generic Language
    Resource Life Cycle that can be used to inform, direct, control and evaluate LR
    research and development activities (including description, management, production,
    validation and evaluation workflows).

  abstract: Everyday meals are an important part of our daily lives and, currently,
    there are many Internet sites that help us plan these meals. Allied to the growth
    in the amount of food data such as recipes available on the Internet is an increase
    in the number of studies on these data, such as recipe analysis and recipe search.
    However, there are few publicly available resources for food research; those that
    do exist do not include a wide range of food data or any meal data (that is, likely
    combinations of recipes). In this study, we construct a large-scale recipe and
    meal data collection as the underlying infrastructure to promote food research.
    Our corpus consists of approximately 1.7 million recipes and 36000 meals in cookpad,
    one of the largest recipe sites in the world. We made the corpus available to
    researchers in February 2015 and as of February 2016, 82 research groups at 56
    universities have made use of it to enhance their studies.

  abstract: Although there are many tools for natural language processing tasks in
    Estonian, these tools are very loosely interoperable, and it is not easy to build
    practical applications on top of them. In this paper, we introduce a new Python
    library for natural language processing in Estonian, which provides unified programming
    interface for various NLP components. The EstNLTK toolkit provides utilities for
    basic NLP tasks including tokenization, morphological analysis, lemmatisation
    and named entity recognition as well as offers more advanced features such as
    a clause segmentation, temporal expression extraction and normalization, verb
    chain detection, Estonian Wordnet integration and rule-based information extraction.
    Accompanied by a detailed API documentation and comprehensive tutorials, EstNLTK
    is suitable for a wide range of audience. We believe EstNLTK is mature enough
    to be used for developing NLP-backed systems both in industry and research. EstNLTK
    is freely available under the GNU GPL version 2+ license, which is standard for
    academic software.

  abstract: 'This presentation introduces the imminent establishment of a new language
    resource infrastructure focusing on languages spoken in Southern Africa, with
    an eventual aim to become a hub for digital language resources within Sub-Saharan
    Africa. The Constitution of South Africa makes provision for 11 official languages
    all with equal status. The current language Resource Management Agency will be
    merged with the new Centre, which will have a wider focus than that of data acquisition,
    management and distribution. The Centre will entertain two main programs: Digitisation
    and Digital Humanities. The digitisation program will focus on the systematic
    digitisation of relevant text, speech and multi-modal data across the official
    languages. Relevancy will be determined by a Scientific Advisory Board. This will
    take place on a continuous basis through specified projects allocated to national
    members of the Centre, as well as through open-calls aimed at the academic as
    well as local communities. The digital resources will be managed and distributed
    through a dedicated web-based portal. The development of the Digital Humanities
    program will entail extensive academic support for projects implementing digital
    language based data. The Centre will function as an enabling research infrastructure
    primarily supported by national government and hosted by the North-West University.'

  abstract: In this paper, we report on the design and development of an online search
    platform for the MERLIN corpus of learner texts in Czech, German and Italian.
    It was created in the context of the MERLIN project, which aims at empirically
    illustrating features of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for
    evaluating language competences based on authentic learner text productions compiled
    into a learner corpus. Furthermore, the project aims at providing access to the
    corpus through a search interface adapted to the needs of multifaceted target
    groups involved with language learning and teaching. This article starts by providing
    a brief overview on the project ambition, the data resource and its intended target
    groups. Subsequently, the main focus of the article is on the design and development
    process of the platform, which is carried out in a user-centred fashion. The paper
    presents the user studies carried out to collect requirements, details the resulting
    decisions concerning the platform design and its implementation, and reports on
    the evaluation of the platform prototype and final adjustments.

  abstract: "Language resources are valuable assets, both for institutions and researchers.\
    \ To safeguard these resources requirements for repository systems and data management\
    \ have been specified by various branch organizations, e.g., CLARIN and the Data\
    \ Seal of Approval. This paper describes these and some additional ones posed\
    \ by the authors\u2019 home institutions. And it shows how they are met by FLAT,\
    \ to provide a new home for language resources. The basis of FLAT is formed by\
    \ the Fedora Commons repository system. This repository system can meet many of\
    \ the requirements out-of-the box, but still additional configuration and some\
    \ development work is needed to meet the remaining ones, e.g., to add support\
    \ for Handles and Component Metadata. This paper describes design decisions taken\
    \ in the construction of FLAT\u2019s system architecture via a mix-and-match strategy,\
    \ with a preference for the reuse of existing solutions. FLAT is developed and\
    \ used by the Meertens Institute and The Language Archive, but is also freely\
    \ available for anyone in need of a CLARIN-compliant repository for their language\

  abstract: The Component MetaData Infrastructure (CMDI) is a framework for the creation
    and usage of metadata formats to describe all kinds of resources in the CLARIN
    world. To better connect to the library world, and to allow librarians to enter
    metadata for linguistic resources into their catalogues, a crosswalk from CMDI-based
    formats to bibliographic standards is required. The general and rather fluid nature
    of CMDI, however, makes it hard to map arbitrary CMDI schemas to metadata standards
    such as Dublin Core (DC) or MARC 21, which have a mature, well-defined and fixed
    set of field descriptors. In this paper, we address the issue and propose crosswalks
    between CMDI-based profiles originating from the NaLiDa project and DC and MARC
    21, respectively.

  abstract: Data management plans, data sharing plans and the like are now required
    by funders worldwide as part of research proposals. Concerned with promoting the
    notion of open scientific data, funders view such plans as the framework for satisfying
    the generally accepted requirements for data generated in funded research projects,
    among them that it be accessible, usable, standardized to the degree possible,
    secure and stable. This paper examines the origins of data management plans, their
    requirements and issues they raise for data centers and HLT resource development
    in general.

  abstract: We introduce JCoRe 2.0, the relaunch of a UIMA-based open software repository
    for full-scale natural language processing originating from the Jena University
    Language & Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab. In an attempt to put the new release
    of JCoRe on firm software engineering ground, we uploaded it to GitHub, a social
    coding platform, with an underlying source code versioning system and various
    means to support collaboration for software development and code modification
    management. In order to automate the builds of complex NLP pipelines and properly
    represent and track dependencies of the underlying Java code, we incorporated
    Maven as part of our software configuration management efforts. In the meantime,
    we have deployed our artifacts on Maven Central, as well. JCoRe 2.0 offers a broad
    range of text analytics functionality (mostly) for English-language scientific
    abstracts and full-text articles, especially from the life sciences domain.

  abstract: "The issue for CLARIN archives at the metadata level is to facilitate\
    \ the user\u2019s possibility to describe their data, even with their own standard,\
    \ and at the same time make these metadata meaningful for a variety of users with\
    \ a variety of resource types, and ensure that the metadata are useful for search\
    \ across all resources both at the national and at the European level. We see\
    \ that different people from different research communities fill in the metadata\
    \ in different ways even though the metadata was defined and documented. This\
    \ has impacted when the metadata are harvested and displayed in different environments.\
    \ A loss of information is at stake. In this paper we view the challenges of ensuring\
    \ metadata interoperability through examples of propagation of metadata values\
    \ from the CLARIN-DK archive to the VLO. We see that the CLARIN Community in many\

  abstract: "The article describes the current status of a large national project,\
    \ CoRoLa, aiming at building a reference corpus for the contemporary Romanian\
    \ language. Unlike many other national corpora, CoRoLa contains only - IPR cleared\
    \ texts and speech data, obtained from some of the country\u2019s most representative\
    \ publishing houses, broadcasting agencies, editorial offices, newspapers and\
    \ popular bloggers. For the written component 500 million tokens are targeted\
    \ and for the oral one 300 hours of recordings. The choice of texts is done according\
    \ to their functional style, domain and subdomain, also with an eye to the international\
    \ practice. A metadata file (following the CMDI model) is associated to each text\
    \ file. Collected texts are cleaned and transformed in a format compatible with\
    \ the tools for automatic processing (segmentation, tokenization, lemmatization,\
    \ part-of-speech tagging). The paper also presents up-to-date statistics about\
    \ the structure of the corpus almost two years before its official launching.\
    \ The corpus will be freely available for searching. Users will be able to download\
    \ the results of their searches and those original files when not against stipulations\
    \ in the protocols we have with text providers."

  abstract: The paper concentrates on the design, composition and annotation of SYN2015,
    a new 100-million representative corpus of contemporary written Czech. SYN2015
    is a sequel of the representative corpora of the SYN series that can be described
    as traditional (as opposed to the web-crawled corpora), featuring cleared copyright
    issues, well-defined composition, reliability of annotation and high-quality text
    processing. At the same time, SYN2015 is designed as a reflection of the variety
    of written Czech text production with necessary methodological and technological
    enhancements that include a detailed bibliographic annotation and text classification
    based on an updated scheme. The corpus has been produced using a completely rebuilt
    text processing toolchain called SynKorp. SYN2015 is lemmatized, morphologically
    and syntactically annotated with state-of-the-art tools. It has been published
    within the framework of the Czech National Corpus and it is available via the
    standard corpus query interface KonText at http://kontext.korpus.cz as well as
    a dataset in shuffled format.

  abstract: This proposal describes a new way to visualise resources in the LREMap,
    a community-built repository of language resource descriptions and uses. The LREMap
    is represented as a force-directed graph, where resources, papers and authors
    are nodes. The analysis of the visual representation of the underlying graph is
    used to study how the community gathers around LRs and how LRs are used in research.

  abstract: 'Researchers in Natural Language Processing rely on availability of data
    and software, ideally under open licenses, but little is done to actively encourage
    it. In fact, the current Copyright framework grants exclusive rights to authors
    to copy their works, make them available to the public and make derivative works
    (such as annotated language corpora). Moreover, in the EU databases are protected
    against unauthorized extraction and re-utilization of their contents. Therefore,
    proper public licensing plays a crucial role in providing access to research data.
    A public license is a license that grants certain rights not to one particular
    user, but to the general public (everybody). Our article presents a tool that
    we developed and whose purpose is to assist the user in the licensing process.
    As software and data should be licensed under different licenses, the tool is
    composed of two separate parts: Data and Software. The underlying logic as well
    as elements of the graphic interface are presented below.'

  abstract: "The Low Resource Language research conducted under DARPA\u2019s Broad\
    \ Operational Language Translation (BOLT) program required the rapid creation\
    \ of text corpora of typologically diverse languages (Turkish, Hausa, and Uzbek)\
    \ which were annotated with morphological information, along with other types\
    \ of annotation. Since the output of morphological analyzers is a significant\
    \ aid to morphological annotation, we developed a morphological analyzer for each\
    \ language in order to support the annotation task, and also as a deliverable\
    \ by itself. Our framework for analyzer creation results in tables similar to\
    \ those used in the successful SAMA analyzer for Arabic, but with a more abstract\
    \ linguistic level, from which the tables are derived. A lexicon was developed\
    \ from available resources for integration with the analyzer, and given the speed\
    \ of development and uncertain coverage of the lexicon, we assumed that the analyzer\
    \ would necessarily be lacking in some coverage for the project annotation. Our\
    \ analyzer framework was therefore focused on rapid implementation of the key\
    \ structures of the language, together with accepting \u201Cwildcard\u201D solutions\
    \ as possible analyses for a word with an unknown stem, building upon our similar\
    \ experiences with morphological annotation with Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian\
    \ Arabic."

  abstract: We propose a novel neural lemmatization model which is language independent
    and supervised in nature. To handle the words in a neural framework, word embedding
    technique is used to represent words as vectors. The proposed lemmatizer makes
    use of contextual information of the surface word to be lemmatized. Given a word
    along with its contextual neighbours as input, the model is designed to produce
    the lemma of the concerned word as output. We introduce a new network architecture
    that permits only dimension specific connections between the input and the output
    layer of the model. For the present work, Bengali is taken as the reference language.
    Two datasets are prepared for training and testing purpose consisting of 19,159
    and 2,126 instances respectively. As Bengali is a resource scarce language, these
    datasets would be beneficial for the respective research community. Evaluation
    method shows that the neural lemmatizer achieves 69.57% accuracy on the test dataset
    and outperforms the simple cosine similarity based baseline strategy by a margin
    of 1.37%.

  abstract: This paper presents a semi-automatic method to derive morphological analyzers
    from a limited number of example inflections suitable for languages with alphabetic
    writing systems. The system we present learns the inflectional behavior of morphological
    paradigms from examples and converts the learned paradigms into a finite-state
    transducer that is able to map inflected forms of previously unseen words into
    lemmas and corresponding morphosyntactic descriptions. We evaluate the system
    when provided with inflection tables for several languages collected from the
    Wiktionary.

  abstract: Despite a centuries-long tradition in lexicography, Latin lacks state-of-the-art
    computational lexical resources. This situation is strictly related to the still
    quite limited amount of linguistically annotated textual data for Latin, which
    can help the building of new lexical resources by supporting them with empirical
    evidence. However, projects for creating new language resources for Latin have
    been launched over the last decade to fill this gap. In this paper, we present
    Latin Vallex, a valency lexicon for Latin built in mutual connection with the
    semantic and pragmatic annotation of two Latin treebanks featuring texts of different
    eras. On the one hand, such a connection between the empirical evidence provided
    by the treebanks and the lexicon allows to enhance each frame entry in the lexicon
    with its frequency in real data. On the other hand, each valency-capable word
    in the treebanks is linked to a frame entry in the lexicon.

  abstract: 'Given lexical-semantic resources in different languages, it is useful
    to establish cross-lingual correspondences, preferably with semantic relation
    labels, between the concept nodes in these resources. This paper presents a framework
    for enabling a cross-lingual/node-wise alignment of lexical-semantic resources,
    where cross-lingual correspondence candidates are first discovered and ranked,
    and then classified by a succeeding module. Indeed, we propose that a two-tier
    classifier configuration is feasible for the second module: the first classifier
    filters out possibly irrelevant correspondence candidates and the second classifier
    assigns a relatively fine-grained semantic relation label to each of the surviving
    candidates. The results of Japanese-to-English alignment experiments using EDR
    Electronic Dictionary and Princeton WordNet are described to exemplify the validity
    of the proposal.'

  abstract: The last two decades have seen the development of various semantic lexical
    resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) and the USAS semantic lexicon (Rayson
    et al., 2004), which have played an important role in the areas of natural language
    processing and corpus-based studies. Recently, increasing efforts have been devoted
    to extending the semantic frameworks of existing lexical knowledge resources to
    cover more languages, such as EuroWordNet and Global WordNet. In this paper, we
    report on the construction of large-scale multilingual semantic lexicons for twelve
    languages, which employ the unified Lancaster semantic taxonomy and provide a
    multilingual lexical knowledge base for the automatic UCREL semantic annotation
    system (USAS). Our work contributes towards the goal of constructing larger-scale
    and higher-quality multilingual semantic lexical resources and developing corpus
    annotation tools based on them. Lexical coverage is an important factor concerning
    the quality of the lexicons and the performance of the corpus annotation tools,
    and in this experiment we focus on evaluating the lexical coverage achieved by
    the multilingual lexicons and semantic annotation tools based on them. Our evaluation
    shows that some semantic lexicons such as those for Finnish and Italian have achieved
    lexical coverage of over 90% while others need further expansion.

  abstract: "We present the dict_to_4lang tool for processing entries of three monolingual\
    \ dictionaries of English and mapping definitions to concept graphs following\
    \ the 4lang principles of semantic representation introduced by (Kornai, 2010).\
    \ 4lang representations are domain- and language-independent, and make use of\
    \ only a very limited set of primitives to encode the meaning of all utterances.\
    \ Our pipeline relies on the Stanford Dependency Parser for syntactic analysis,\
    \ the dep to 4lang module then builds directed graphs of concepts based on dependency\
    \ relations between words in each definition. Several issues are handled by construction-specific\
    \ rules that are applied to the output of dep_to_4lang. Manual evaluation suggests\
    \ that ca. 75% of graphs built from the Longman Dictionary are either entirely\
    \ correct or contain only minor errors. dict_to_4lang is available under an MIT\
    \ license as part of the 4lang library and has been used successfully in measuring\
    \ Semantic Textual Similarity (Recski and \xC1cs, 2015). An interactive demo of\
    \ core 4lang functionalities is available at http://4lang.hlt.bme.hu."

  abstract: "This article presents the semantic layer of Walenty\u2015a new valence\
    \ dictionary of Polish predicates, with a number of novel features, as compared\
    \ to other such dictionaries. The dictionary contains two layers, syntactic and\
    \ semantic. The syntactic layer describes syntactic and morphosyntactic constraints\
    \ predicates put on their dependants. In particular, it includes a comprehensive\
    \ and powerful phraseological component. The semantic layer shows how predicates\
    \ and their arguments are involved in a described situation in an utterance. These\
    \ two layers are connected, representing how semantic arguments can be realised\
    \ on the surface. Each syntactic schema and each semantic frame are illustrated\
    \ by at least one exemplary sentence attested in linguistic reality. The semantic\
    \ layer consists of semantic frames represented as lists of pairs and connected\
    \ with PlWordNet lexical units. Semantic roles have a two-level representation\
    \ (basic roles are provided with an attribute) enabling representation of arguments\
    \ in a flexible way. Selectional preferences are based on PlWordNet structure\
    \ as well."

  abstract: "This paper proposes a new method for Italian verb classification -and\
    \ a preliminary example of resulting classes- inspired by Levin (1993) and VerbNet\
    \ (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), yet partially independent from these resources; we achieved\
    \ such a result by integrating Levin and VerbNet\u2019s models of classification\
    \ with other theoretic frameworks and resources. The classification is rooted\
    \ in the constructionist framework (Goldberg, 1995; 2006) and is distribution-based.\
    \ It is also semantically characterized by a link to FrameNet\u2019ssemanticframesto\
    \ represent the event expressed by a class. However, the new Italian classes maintain\
    \ the hierarchic \u201Ctree\u201D structure and monotonic nature of VerbNet\u2019\
    s classes, and, where possible, the original names (e.g.: Verbs of Killing, Verbs\
    \ of Putting, etc.). We therefore propose here a taxonomy compatible with VerbNet\
    \ but at the same time adapted to Italian syntax and semantics. It also addresses\
    \ a number of problems intrinsic to the original classifications, such as the\
    \ role of argument alternations, here regarded simply as epiphenomena, consistently\
    \ with the constructionist approach."

  abstract: 'Patients are often exposed to medical terms, such as anosognosia, myelodysplastic,
    or hepatojejunostomy, that can be semantically complex and hardly understandable
    by non-experts in medicine. Hence, it is important to assess which words are potentially
    non-understandable and require further explanations. The purpose of our work is
    to build specific lexicon in which the words are rated according to whether they
    are understandable or non-understandable. We propose to work with medical words
    in French such as provided by an international medical terminology. The terms
    are segmented in single words and then each word is manually processed by three
    annotators. The objective is to assign each word into one of the three categories:
    I can understand, I am not sure, I cannot understand. The annotators do not have
    medical training nor they present specific medical problems. They are supposed
    to represent an average patient. The inter-annotator agreement is then computed.
    The content of the categories is analyzed. Possible applications in which this
    lexicon can be helpful are proposed and discussed. The rated lexicon is freely
    available for the research purposes. It is accessible online at http://natalia.grabar.perso.sfr.fr/rated-lexicon.html'

  abstract: Word sense embeddings represent a word sense as a low-dimensional numeric
    vector. While this representation is potentially useful for NLP applications,
    its interpretability is inherently limited. We propose a simple technique that
    improves interpretability of sense vectors by mapping them to synsets of a lexical
    resource. Our experiments with AdaGram sense embeddings and BabelNet synsets show
    that it is possible to retrieve synsets that correspond to automatically learned
    sense vectors with Precision of 0.87, Recall of 0.42 and AUC of 0.78.

  abstract: 'This paper presents a lexical resource developed for Portuguese. The
    resource contains sentences annotated with semantic roles. The sentences were
    extracted from two domains: Cardiology research papers and newspaper articles.
    Both corpora were analyzed with the PALAVRAS parser and subsequently processed
    with a subcategorization frames extractor, so that each sentence that contained
    at least one main verb was stored in a database together with its syntactic organization.
    The annotation was manually carried out by a linguist using an annotation interface.
    Both the annotated and non-annotated data were exported to an XML format, which
    is readily available for download. The reason behind exporting non-annotated data
    is that there is syntactic information collected from the parser annotation in
    the non-annotated data, and this could be useful for other researchers. The sentences
    from both corpora were annotated separately, so that it is possible to access
    sentences either from the Cardiology or from the newspaper corpus. The full resource
    presents more than seven thousand semantically annotated sentences, containing
    192 different verbs and more than 15 thousand individual arguments and adjuncts.'

    from the integration of multiple sources of predicate information including FrameNet,
    VerbNet, PropBank and WordNet. This new version of the Predicate Matrix has been
    extended to cover nominal predicates by adding mappings to NomBank. Similarly,
    we have integrated resources in Spanish, Catalan and Basque. As a result, the
    Predicate Matrix 1.3 provides a multilingual lexicon to allow interoperable semantic
    analysis in multiple languages.

  abstract: We present a gold standard for evaluating scale membership and the order
    of scalar adjectives. In addition to evaluating existing methods of ordering adjectives,
    this knowledge will aid in studying the organization of adjectives in the lexicon.
    This resource is the result of two elicitation tasks conducted with informants
    from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The first task is notable for gathering open-ended
    lexical data from informants. The data is analyzed using Cultural Consensus Theory,
    a framework from anthropology, to not only determine scale membership but also
    the level of consensus among the informants (Romney et al., 1986). The second
    task gathers a culturally salient ordering of the words determined to be members.
    We use this method to produce 12 scales of adjectives for use in evaluation.

  abstract: 'In this paper we describe VerbCROcean, a broad-coverage repository of
    fine-grained semantic relations between Croatian verbs. Adopting the methodology
    of Chklovski and Pantel (2004) used for acquiring the English VerbOcean, we first
    acquire semantically related verb pairs from a web corpus hrWaC by relying on
    distributional similarity of subject-verb-object paths in the dependency trees.
    We then classify the semantic relations between each pair of verbs as similarity,
    intensity, antonymy, or happens-before, using a number of manually-constructed
    lexico-syntatic patterns. We evaluate the quality of the resulting resource on
    a manually annotated sample of 1000 semantic verb relations. The evaluation revealed
    that the predictions are most accurate for the similarity relation, and least
    accurate for the intensity relation. We make available two variants of VerbCROcean:
    a coverage-oriented version, containing about 36k verb pairs at a precision of
    41%, and a precision-oriented version containing about 5k verb pairs, at a precision
    of 56%.'

  abstract: In this article we present an exploratory approach to enrich a WordNet-like
    lexical ontology with the synonyms present in a standard monolingual Portuguese
    dictionary. The dictionary was converted from PDF into XML and senses were automatically
    identified and annotated. This allowed us to extract them, independently of definitions,
    and to create sets of synonyms (synsets). These synsets were then aligned with
    WordNet synsets, both in the same language (Portuguese) and projecting the Portuguese
    terms into English, Spanish and Galician. This process allowed both the addition
    of new term variants to existing synsets, as to create new synsets for Portuguese.

  abstract: "Collecting data for sentiment analysis in resource-limited languages\
    \ carries a significant risk of sample selection bias, since the small quantities\
    \ of available data are most likely not representative of the whole population.\
    \ Ignoring this bias leads to less robust machine learning classifiers and less\
    \ reliable evaluation results. In this paper we present a dataset balancing algorithm\
    \ that minimizes the sample selection bias by eliminating irrelevant systematic\
    \ differences between the sentiment classes. We prove its superiority over the\
    \ random sampling method and we use it to create the Serbian movie review dataset\
    \ \u2015 SerbMR \u2015 the first balanced and topically uniform sentiment analysis\
    \ dataset in Serbian. In addition, we propose an incremental way of finding the\
    \ optimal combination of simple text processing options and machine learning features\
    \ for sentiment classification. Several popular classifiers are used in conjunction\
    \ with this evaluation approach in order to establish strong but reliable baselines\
    \ for sentiment analysis in Serbian."

  abstract: 'This paper introduces the augmented NTU sentiment dictionary, abbreviated
    as ANTUSD, which is constructed by collecting sentiment stats of words in several
    sentiment annotation work. A total of 26,021 words were collected in ANTUSD. For
    each word, the CopeOpi numerical sentiment score and the number of positive annotation,
    neutral annotation, negative annotation, non-opinionated annotation, and not-a-word
    annotation are provided. Words and their sentiment information in ANTUSD have
    been linked to the Chinese ontology E-HowNet to provide rich semantic information.
    We demonstrate the usage of ANTUSD in polarity classification of words, and the
    results show that a superior f-score 98.21 is achieved, which supports the usefulness
    of the ANTUSD. ANTUSD can be freely obtained through application from NLPSA lab,

  abstract: Due to the phenomenal growth of online product reviews, sentiment analysis
    (SA) has gained huge attention, for example, by online service providers. A number
    of benchmark datasets for a wide range of domains have been made available for
    sentiment analysis, especially in resource-rich languages. In this paper we assess
    the challenges of SA in Hindi by providing a benchmark setup, where we create
    an annotated dataset of high quality, build machine learning models for sentiment
    analysis in order to show the effective usage of the dataset, and finally make
    the resource available to the community for further advancement of research. The
    dataset comprises of Hindi product reviews crawled from various online sources.
    Each sentence of the review is annotated with aspect term and its associated sentiment.
    As classification algorithms we use Conditional Random Filed (CRF) and Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) for aspect term extraction and sentiment analysis, respectively.
    Evaluation results show the average F-measure of 41.07% for aspect term extraction
    and accuracy of 54.05% for sentiment classification.

  abstract: 'This paper deals with building linguistic resources for Gulf Arabic,
    one of the Arabic variations, for sentiment analysis task using machine learning.
    To our knowledge, no previous works were done for Gulf Arabic sentiment analysis
    despite the fact that it is present in different online platforms. Hence, the
    first challenge is the absence of annotated data and sentiment lexicons. To fill
    this gap, we created these two main linguistic resources. Then we conducted different
    experiments: use Naive Bayes classifier without any lexicon; add a sentiment lexicon
    designed basically for MSA; use only the compiled Gulf Arabic sentiment lexicon
    and finally use both MSA and Gulf Arabic sentiment lexicons. The Gulf Arabic lexicon
    gives a good improvement of the classifier accuracy (90.54 %) over a baseline
    that does not use the lexicon (82.81%), while the MSA lexicon causes the accuracy
    to drop to (76.83%). Moreover, mixing MSA and Gulf Arabic lexicons causes the
    accuracy to drop to (84.94%) compared to using only Gulf Arabic lexicon. This
    indicates that it is useless to use MSA resources to deal with Gulf Arabic due
    to the considerable differences and conflicting structures between these two languages.'

  abstract: Sentiment shifters, i.e., words and expressions that can affect text polarity,
    play an important role in opinion mining. However, the limited ability of current
    automated opinion mining systems to handle shifters represents a major challenge.
    The majority of existing approaches rely on a manual list of shifters; few attempts
    have been made to automatically identify shifters in text. Most of them just focus
    on negating shifters. This paper presents a novel and efficient semi-automatic
    method for identifying sentiment shifters in drug reviews, aiming at improving
    the overall accuracy of opinion mining systems. To this end, we use weighted association
    rule mining (WARM), a well-known data mining technique, for finding frequent dependency
    patterns representing sentiment shifters from a domain-specific corpus. These
    patterns that include different kinds of shifter words such as shifter verbs and
    quantifiers are able to handle both local and long-distance shifters. We also
    combine these patterns with a lexicon-based approach for the polarity classification
    task. Experiments on drug reviews demonstrate that extracted shifters can improve
    the precision of the lexicon-based approach for polarity classification 9.25 percent.

    annotated for discourse structure in the style of SDRT (Asher and Lascarides,
    2003; Lascarides and Asher, 2009). The main goal of the STAC project is to study
    the discourse structure of multi-party dialogues in order to understand the linguistic
    strategies adopted by interlocutors to achieve their conversational goals, especially
    when these goals are opposed. The STAC corpus is not only a rich source of data
    on strategic conversation, but also the first corpus that we are aware of that
    provides full discourse structures for multi-party dialogues. It has other remarkable
    features that make it an interesting resource for other topics: interleaved threads,
    creative language, and interactions between linguistic and extra-linguistic contexts.'

  abstract: This paper presents an automatic corpus-based process to author an open-domain
    conversational strategy usable both in chatterbot systems and as a fallback strategy
    for out-of-domain human utterances. Our approach is implemented on a corpus of
    television drama subtitles. This system is used as a chatterbot system to collect
    a corpus of 41 open-domain textual dialogues with 27 human participants. The general
    capabilities of the system are studied through objective measures and subjective
    self-reports in terms of understandability, repetition and coherence of the system
    responses selected in reaction to human utterances. Subjective evaluations of
    the collected dialogues are presented with respect to amusement, engagement and
    enjoyability. The main factors influencing those dimensions in our chatterbot
    experiment are discussed.

  abstract: In this study, we describe the use of back-channelling patterns extracted
    from a dialogue corpus as a mean to characterising text-based dialogue systems.
    Our goal was to provide system users with the feeling that they are interacting
    with distinct individuals rather than artificially created characters. An analysis
    of the corpus revealed that substantial difference exists among speakers regarding
    the usage patterns of back-channelling. The patterns consist of back-channelling
    frequency, types, and expressions. They were used for system characterisation.
    Implemented system characters were tested by asking users of the dialogue system
    to identify the source speakers in the corpus. Experimental results suggest that
    possibility of using back-channelling patterns alone to characterize the dialogue
    system in some cases even among the same age and gender groups.

  abstract: "Team word-guessing games where one player, the clue-giver, gives clues\

    \ an engaging computational agent capable of emulating a talented human clue-giver\

  abstract: In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to automatically construct
    parallel discourse corpus for dialogue machine translation. Firstly, the parallel
    subtitle data and its corresponding monolingual movie script data are crawled
    and collected from Internet. Then tags such as speaker and discourse boundary
    from the script data are projected to its subtitle data via an information retrieval
    approach in order to map monolingual discourse to bilingual texts. We not only
    evaluate the mapping results, but also integrate speaker information into the
    translation. Experiments show our proposed method can achieve 81.79% and 98.64%
    accuracy on speaker and dialogue boundary annotation, and speaker-based language
    model adaptation can obtain around 0.5 BLEU points improvement in translation
    qualities. Finally, we publicly release around 100K parallel discourse data with
    manual speaker and dialogue boundary annotation.

  abstract: Automatic evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) is typically approached
    by measuring similarity between the candidate MT and a human reference translation.
    An important limitation of existing evaluation systems is that they are unable
    to distinguish candidate-reference differences that arise due to acceptable linguistic
    variation from the differences induced by MT errors. In this paper we present
    a new metric, UPF-Cobalt, that addresses this issue by taking into consideration
    the syntactic contexts of candidate and reference words. The metric applies a
    penalty when the words are similar but the contexts in which they occur are not
    equivalent. In this way, Machine Translations (MTs) that are different from the
    human translation but still essentially correct are distinguished from those that
    share high number of words with the reference but alter the meaning of the sentence
    due to translation errors. The results show that the method proposed is indeed
    beneficial for automatic MT evaluation. We report experiments based on two different
    evaluation tasks with various types of manual quality assessment. The metric significantly
    outperforms state-of-the-art evaluation systems in varying evaluation settings.

    (MT) system is how much effort is required to adapt the system to a different
    language pair or a new domain. In this paper, we describe a way of adapting an
    existing hybrid MT system to a new language pair, and show that such a system
    can outperform a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system
    with an average of 10 persons/month of work. This is specifically important in
    the case of domain-specific MT for which there is not enough parallel data for
    training a statistical machine translation system.

  abstract: "Word translations arise in dictionary-like organization as well as via\
    \ machine learning from corpora. The former is exemplified by Wiktionary, a crowd-sourced\
    \ dictionary with editions in many languages. \xC1cs et al. (2013) obtain word\
    \ translations from Wiktionary with the pivot-based method, also called triangulation,\
    \ that infers word translations in a pair of languages based on translations to\
    \ other, typically better resourced ones called pivots. Triangulation may introduce\
    \ noise if words in the pivot are polysemous. The reliability of each triangulated\
    \ translation is basically estimated by the number of pivot languages (Tanaka\
    \ et al 1994). Mikolov et al (2013) introduce a method for generating or scoring\
    \ word translations. Translation is formalized as a linear mapping between distributed\
    \ vector space models (VSM) of the two languages. VSMs are trained on monolingual\
    \ data, while the mapping is learned in a supervised fashion, using a seed dictionary\
    \ of some thousand word pairs. The mapping can be used to associate existing translations\
    \ with a real-valued similarity score. This paper exploits human labor in Wiktionary\
    \ combined with distributional information in VSMs. We train VSMs on gigaword\
    \ corpora, and the linear translation mapping on direct (non-triangulated) Wiktionary\
    \ pairs. This mapping is used to filter triangulated translations based on scores.\
    \ The motivation is that scores by the mapping may be a smoother measure of merit\
    \ than considering only the number of pivot for the triangle. We evaluate the\
    \ scores against dictionaries extracted from parallel corpora (Tiedemann 2012).\
    \ We show that linear translation really provides a more reliable method for triangle\
    \ scoring than pivot count. The methods we use are language-independent, and the\
    \ training data is easy to obtain for many languages. We chose the German-Hungarian\
    \ pair for evaluation, in which the filtered triangles resulting from our experiments\
    \ are the greatest freely available list of word translations we are aware of."

  abstract: Although it is commonly assumed that word sense disambiguation (WSD) should
    help to improve lexical choice and improve the quality of machine translation
    systems, how to successfully integrate word senses into such systems remains an
    unanswered question. Some successful approaches have involved reformulating either
    WSD or the word senses it produces, but work on using traditional word senses
    to improve machine translation have met with limited success. In this paper, we
    build upon previous work that experimented on including word senses as contextual
    features in maxent-based translation models. Training on a large, open-domain
    corpus (Europarl), we demonstrate that this aproach yields significant improvements
    in machine translation from English to Portuguese.

    \ corpora have no tendency towards closure\u2015that is, they tend towards infinity.\
    \ In contrast, non-representative corpora have a tendency towards closure\u2015\
    roughly, finiteness. SuperCAT focuses on general techniques for the quantitative\
    \ description of the characteristics of any corpus (or other language sample),\
    \ particularly concerning the characteristics of lexical distributions. Additionally,\

  abstract: 'The web data contains immense amount of data, hundreds of billion words
    are waiting to be extracted and used for language research. In this work we introduce
    our tool LanguageCrawl which allows NLP researchers to easily construct web-scale
    corpus from Common Crawl Archive: a petabyte scale, open repository of web crawl
    information. Three use-cases are presented: filtering Polish websites, building
    an N-gram corpora and training continuous skip-gram language model with hierarchical
    softmax. Each of them has been implemented within the LanguageCrawl toolkit, with
    the possibility to adjust specified language and N-gram ranks. Special effort
    has been put on high computing efficiency, by applying highly concurrent multitasking.
    We make our tool publicly available to enrich NLP resources. We strongly believe
    that our work will help to facilitate NLP research, especially in under-resourced
    languages, where the lack of appropriately sized corpora is a serious hindrance
    to applying data-intensive methods, such as deep neural networks.'

    generic querying and standard interfaces. This development is especially relevant
    in the context of integrated research environments like CLARIN or DARIAH. The
    paper focuses on several applications and implementation details on the basis
    of a unified corpus format, a unique POS tag set, and prepared data for word similarities.
    All described data or applications are already or will be in the near future accessible
    via well-documented RESTful Web services. The target group are all kinds of interested
    persons with varying level of experience in programming or corpus query languages.

  abstract: "We address the task of automatically correcting preposition errors in\
    \ learners\u2019 Dutch by modelling preposition usage in native language. Specifically,\
    \ we build two models exploiting a large corpus of Dutch. The first is a binary\
    \ model for detecting whether a preposition should be used at all in a given position\
    \ or not. The second is a multiclass model for selecting the appropriate preposition\
    \ in case one should be used. The models are tested on native as well as learners\
    \ data. For the latter we exploit a crowdsourcing strategy to elicit native judgements.\
    \ On native test data the models perform very well, showing that we can model\
    \ preposition usage appropriately. However, the evaluation on learners\u2019 data\
    \ shows that while detecting that a given preposition is wrong is doable reasonably\
    \ well, detecting the absence of a preposition is a lot more difficult. Observing\
    \ such results and the data we deal with, we envisage various ways of improving\
    \ performance, and report them in the final section of this article."

  abstract: In this paper, we present a corpus of news blog conversations in Italian
    annotated with gold standard agreement/disagreement relations at message and sentence
    levels. This is the first resource of this kind in Italian. From the analysis
    of ADRs at the two levels emerged that agreement annotated at message level is
    consistent and generally reflected at sentence level, moreover, the argumentation
    structure of disagreement is more complex than agreement. The manual error analysis
    revealed that this resource is useful not only for the analysis of argumentation,
    but also for the detection of irony/sarcasm in online debates. The corpus and
    annotation tool are available for research purposes on request.

  abstract: We introduce an approach based on using the dependency grammar representations
    of sentences to compute sentence similarity for extractive multi-document summarization.
    We adapt and investigate the effects of two untyped dependency tree kernels, which
    have originally been proposed for relation extraction, to the multi-document summarization
    problem. In addition, we propose a series of novel dependency grammar based kernels
    to better represent the syntactic and semantic similarities among the sentences.
    The proposed methods incorporate the type information of the dependency relations
    for sentence similarity calculation. To our knowledge, this is the first study
    that investigates using dependency tree based sentence similarity for multi-document
    summarization.

  abstract: In this paper, we focus on the verb-particle (V-Prt) split construction
    in English and German and its difficulty for parsing and Machine Translation (MT).
    For German, we use an existing test suite of V-Prt split constructions, while
    for English, we build a new and comparable test suite from raw data. These two
    data sets are then used to perform an analysis of errors in dependency parsing,
    word-level alignment and MT, which arise from the discontinuous order in V-Prt
    split constructions. In the automatic alignments of parallel corpora, most of
    the particles align to NULL. These mis-alignments and the inability of phrase-based
    MT system to recover discontinuous phrases result in low quality translations
    of V-Prt split constructions both in English and German. However, our results
    show that the V-Prt split phrases are correctly parsed in 90% of cases, suggesting
    that syntactic-based MT should perform better on these constructions. We evaluate
    a syntactic-based MT system on German and compare its performance to the phrase-based
    system.

  abstract: "We report on the creation of a lexical resource for the identification\
    \ of potentially unspecific or imprecise constructions in German requirements\
    \ documentation from the car manufacturing industry. In requirements engineering,\
    \ such expressions are called \u201Cweak words\u201D: they are not sufficiently\
    \ precise to ensure an unambiguous interpretation by the contractual partners,\
    \ who for the definition of their cooperation, typically rely on specification\
    \ documents (Melchisedech, 2000); an example are dimension adjectives, such as\

    \ by adverbials indicating the exact duration, size etc. Contrary to standard\
    \ practice in requirements engineering, where the identification of such weak\
    \ words is merely based on stopword lists, we identify weak uses in context, by\
    \ querying annotated text. The queries are part of the resource, as they define\
    \ the conditions when a word use is weak. We evaluate the recognition of weak\

  abstract: The granularity of PolNet (Polish Wordnet) is the main theoretical issue
    discussed in the paper. We describe the latest extension of PolNet including valency
    information of simple verbs and noun-verb collocations using manual and machine-assisted
    methods. Valency is defined to include both semantic and syntactic selectional
    restrictions. We assume the valency structure of a verb to be an index of meaning.
    Consistently we consider it an attribute of a synset. Strict application of this
    principle results in fine granularity of the verb section of the wordnet. Considering
    valency as a distinctive feature of synsets was an essential step to transform
    the initial PolNet (first intended as a lexical ontology) into a lexicon-grammar.
    For the present refinement of PolNet we assume that the category of language register
    is a part of meaning. The totality of PolNet 2.0 synsets is being revised in order
    to split the PolNet 2.0 synsets that contain different register words into register-uniform
    sub-synsets. We completed this operation for synsets that were used as values
    of semantic roles. The operation augmented the number of considered synsets by
    29%. In the paper we report an extension of the class of collocation-based verb
    synsets.

  abstract: Starting from the English affective lexicon ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999a)
    we have created the first Greek affective lexicon. It contains human ratings for
    the three continuous affective dimensions of valence, arousal and dominance for
    1034 words. The Greek affective lexicon is compared with affective lexica in English,
    Spanish and Portuguese. The lexicon is automatically expanded by selecting a small
    number of manually annotated words to bootstrap the process of estimating affective
    ratings of unknown words. We experimented with the parameters of the semantic-affective
    model in order to investigate their impact to its performance, which reaches 85%
    binary classification accuracy (positive vs. negative ratings). We share the Greek
    affective lexicon that consists of 1034 words and the automatically expanded Greek
    affective lexicon that contains 407K words.

    and targets has been made so far. In addition, many language elements of the corpus,
    relevant from the point of view of sentiment analysis, got distinct types of tags
    in the annotation. In this paper, on the one hand, we present the method of annotation,
    and we discuss the difficulties concerning text annotation process. On the other
    hand, we provide some quantitative and qualitative data on the corpus. We conclude
    with a description of the applicability of the corpus.'

  abstract: Sentiment analysis has so far focused on the detection of explicit opinions.
    However, of late implicit opinions have received broader attention, the key idea
    being that the evaluation of an event type by a speaker depends on how the participants
    in the event are valued and how the event itself affects the participants. We
    present an annotation scheme for adding relevant information, couched in terms
    of so-called effect functors, to German lexical items. Our scheme synthesizes
    and extends previous proposals. We report on an inter-annotator agreement study.
    We also present results of a crowdsourcing experiment to test the utility of some
    known and some new functors for opinion inference where, unlike in previous work,
    subjects are asked to reason from event evaluation to participant evaluation.

  abstract: This paper presents NileULex, which is an Arabic sentiment lexicon containing
    close to six thousands Arabic words and compound phrases. Forty five percent of
    the terms and expressions in the lexicon are Egyptian or colloquial while fifty
    five percent are Modern Standard Arabic. While the collection of many of the terms
    included in the lexicon was done automatically, the actual addition of any term
    was done manually. One of the important criterions for adding terms to the lexicon,
    was that they be as unambiguous as possible. The result is a lexicon with a much
    higher quality than any translated variant or automatically constructed one. To
    demonstrate that a lexicon such as this can directly impact the task of sentiment
    analysis, a very basic machine learning based sentiment analyser that uses unigrams,
    bigrams, and lexicon based features was applied on two different Twitter datasets.
    The obtained results were compared to a baseline system that only uses unigrams
    and bigrams. The same lexicon based features were also generated using a publicly
    available translation of a popular sentiment lexicon. The experiments show that
    usage of the developed lexicon improves the results over both the baseline and
    the publicly available lexicon.

    is not dependent on any particular method of sentiment identification and provides
    a built-in sentiment dictionary as a convenient option. Technically, it contains
    implementations of three different modes of opinion tuple generation: one hybrid
    based on dependency parsing and CRF, the second based on shallow parsing and the
    third on deep learning, namely GRU neural network. The paper also contains a description

    within a given document and the aspects to which they refer is known as aspect-based
    sentiment analysis. In this paper we present the first full aspect-based sentiment
    analysis pipeline for Dutch and apply it to customer reviews. To this purpose,
    we collected reviews from two different domains, i.e. restaurant and smartphone
    reviews. Both corpora have been manually annotated using newly developed guidelines
    that comply to standard practices in the field. For our experimental pipeline
    we perceive aspect-based sentiment analysis as a task consisting of three main
    subtasks which have to be tackled incrementally: aspect term extraction, aspect
    category classification and polarity classification. First experiments on our
    Dutch restaurant corpus reveal that this is indeed a feasible approach that yields
    promising results.'

  abstract: We construct a case-based English-to-Chinese semantic constituent parallel
    Treebank for a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) task by labelling each node
    of the Deep Syntactic Tree (DST) with our refined semantic cases. Since subtree
    span-crossing is harmful in tree-based SMT, DST is adopted to alleviate this problem.
    At the same time, we tailor an existing case set to represent bilingual shallow
    semantic relations more precisely. This Treebank is a part of a semantic corpus
    building project, which aims to build a semantic bilingual corpus annotated with
    syntactic, semantic cases and word senses. Data in our Treebank is from the news
    domain of Datum corpus. 4,000 sentence pairs are selected to cover various lexicons
    and part-of-speech (POS) n-gram patterns as much as possible. This paper presents
    the construction of this case Treebank. Also, we have tested the effect of adopting
    DST structure in alleviating subtree span-crossing. Our preliminary analysis shows
    that the compatibility between Chinese and English trees can be significantly
    increased by transforming the parse-tree into the DST. Furthermore, the human
    agreement rate in annotation is found to be acceptable (90% in English nodes,
    75% in Chinese nodes).

  abstract: Morphologically-rich languages pose problems for machine translation (MT)
    systems, including word-alignment errors, data sparsity and multiple affixes.
    Current alignment models at word-level do not distinguish words and morphemes,
    thus yielding low-quality alignment and subsequently affecting end translation
    quality. Models using morpheme-level alignment can reduce the vocabulary size
    of morphologically-rich languages and overcomes data sparsity. The alignment data
    based on smallest units reveals subtle language features and enhances translation
    quality. Recent research proves such morpheme-level alignment (MA) data to be
    valuable linguistic resources for SMT, particularly for languages with rich morphology.
    In support of this research trend, the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) created
    Uzbek-English and Turkish-English alignment data which are manually aligned at
    the morpheme level. This paper describes the creation of MA corpora, including
    alignment and tagging process and approaches, highlighting annotation challenges
    and specific features of languages with rich morphology. The light tagging annotation
    on the alignment layer adds extra value to the MA data, facilitating users in
    flexibly tailoring the data for various MT model training.

  abstract: Parallel corpora are crucial for machine translation (MT), however they
    are quite scarce for most language pairs and domains. As comparable corpora are
    far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract parallel sentences
    from them for MT. In this paper, we exploit the neural network features acquired
    from neural MT for parallel sentence extraction. We observe significant improvements
    for both accuracy in sentence extraction and MT performance.

  abstract: We introduce TweetMT, a parallel corpus of tweets in four language pairs
    that combine five languages (Spanish from/to Basque, Catalan, Galician and Portuguese),
    all of which have an official status in the Iberian Peninsula. The corpus has
    been created by combining automatic collection and crowdsourcing approaches, and
    it is publicly available. It is intended for the development and testing of microtext
    machine translation systems. In this paper we describe the methodology followed
    to build the corpus, and present the results of the shared task in which it was
    tested.

  abstract: "The biomedical scientific literature is a rich source of information\
    \ not only in the English language, for which it is more abundant, but also in\
    \ other languages, such as Portuguese, Spanish and French. We present the first\
    \ freely available parallel corpus of scientific publications for the biomedical\
    \ domain. Documents from the \u201DBiological Sciences\u201D and \u201DHealth\
    \ Sciences\u201D categories were retrieved from the Scielo database and parallel\
    \ titles and abstracts are available for the following language pairs: Portuguese/English\
    \ (about 86,000 documents in total), Spanish/English (about 95,000 documents)\
    \ and French/English (about 2,000 documents). Additionally, monolingual data was\
    \ also collected for all four languages. Sentences in the parallel corpus were\
    \ automatically aligned and a manual analysis of 200 documents by native experts\
    \ found that a minimum of 79% of sentences were correctly aligned in all language\
    \ pairs. We demonstrate the utility of the corpus by running baseline machine\
    \ translation experiments. We show that for all language pairs, a statistical\
    \ machine translation system trained on the parallel corpora achieves performance\
    \ that rivals or exceeds the state of the art in the biomedical domain. Furthermore,\
    \ the corpora are currently being used in the biomedical task in the First Conference\
    \ on Machine Translation (WMT\u201916)."

  abstract: "This paper presents an approach for building large monolingual corpora\
    \ and, at the same time, extracting parallel data by crawling the top-level domain\
    \ of a given language of interest. For gathering linguistically relevant data\
    \ from top-level domains we use the SpiderLing crawler, modified to crawl data\
    \ written in multiple languages. The output of this process is then fed to Bitextor,\
    \ a tool for harvesting parallel data from a collection of documents. We call\
    \ the system combining these two tools Spidextor, a blend of the names of its\
    \ two crucial parts. We evaluate the described approach intrinsically by measuring\
    \ the accuracy of the extracted bitexts from the Croatian top-level domain \u201C\
    .hr\u201D and the Slovene top-level domain \u201C.si\u201D, and extrinsically\
    \ on the English-Croatian language pair by comparing an SMT system built from\
    \ the crawled data with third-party systems. We finally present parallel datasets\

  abstract: We describe a strategy for the acquisition of training data necessary
    to build a social-media-driven early detection system for individuals at risk
    for (preventable) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The strategy uses a game-like
    quiz with data and questions acquired semi-automatically from Twitter. The questions
    are designed to inspire participant engagement and collect relevant data to train
    a public-health model applied to individuals. Prior systems designed to use social
    media such as Twitter to predict obesity (a risk factor for T2DM) operate on entire
    communities such as states, counties, or cities, based on statistics gathered
    by government agencies. Because there is considerable variation among individuals
    within these groups, training data on the individual level would be more effective,
    but this data is difficult to acquire. The approach proposed here aims to address
    this issue. Our strategy has two steps. First, we trained a random forest classifier
    on data gathered from (public) Twitter statuses and state-level statistics with
    state-of-the-art accuracy. We then converted this classifier into a 20-questions-style
    quiz and made it available online. In doing so, we achieved high engagement with
    individuals that took the quiz, while also building a training set of voluntarily
    supplied individual-level data for future classification.

  abstract: We set out to investigate whether TV ratings and mentions of TV programmes
    on the Twitter social media platform are correlated. If such a correlation exists,
    Twitter may be used as an alternative source for estimating viewer popularity.
    Moreover, the Twitter-based rating estimates may be generated during the programme,
    or even before. We count the occurrences of programme-specific hashtags in an
    archive of Dutch tweets of eleven popular TV shows broadcast in the Netherlands
    in one season, and perform correlation tests. Overall we find a strong correlation
    of 0.82; the correlation remains strong, 0.79, if tweets are counted a half hour
    before broadcast time. However, the two most popular TV shows account for most
    of the positive effect; if we leave out the single and second most popular TV
    shows, the correlation drops to being moderate to weak. Also, within a TV show,
    correlations between ratings and tweet counts are mostly weak, while correlations
    between TV ratings of the previous and next shows are strong. In absence of information
    on previous shows, Twitter-based counts may be a viable alternative to classic
    estimation methods for TV ratings. Estimates are more reliable with more popular
    TV shows.

  abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of out-of-vocabulary term classification
    in web forum text from the automotive domain. We develop a set of nine domain-
    and application-specific categories for out-of-vocabulary terms. We then propose
    a supervised approach to classify out-of-vocabulary terms according to these categories,
    drawing on features based on word embeddings, and linguistic knowledge of common
    properties of out-of-vocabulary terms. We show that the features based on word
    embeddings are particularly informative for this task. The categories that we
    predict could serve as a preliminary, automatically-generated source of lexical
    knowledge about out-of-vocabulary terms. Furthermore, we show that this approach
    can be adapted to give a semi-automated method for identifying out-of-vocabulary
    terms of a particular category, automotive named entities, that is of particular
    interest to us.

  abstract: "Many people post about their daily life on social media. These posts\

    \ useful to companies can be derived from them: e.g. profile information of a\
    \ user who mentioned something about their product. As a further advanced analysis,\
    \ we consider extracting users who are likely to buy a product from the set of\
    \ users who mentioned that the product is attractive. In this paper, we report\
    \ our methodology for building a corpus for Twitter user purchase behavior prediction.\
    \ First, we collected Twitter users who posted a want phrase + product name: e.g.\
    \ \u201Cwant a Xperia\u201D as candidate want users, and also candidate bought\
    \ users in the same way. Then, we asked an annotator to judge whether a candidate\
    \ user actually bought a product. We also annotated whether tweets randomly sampled\
    \ from want/bought user timelines are relevant or not to purchase. In this annotation,\
    \ 58% of want user tweets and 35% of bought user tweets were annotated as relevant.\
    \ Our data indicate that information embedded in timeline tweets can be used to\

  abstract: Hashtags, which are commonly composed of multiple words, are increasingly
    used to convey the actual messages in tweets. Understanding what tweets are saying
    is getting more dependent on understanding hashtags. Therefore, identifying the
    individual words that constitute a hashtag is an important, yet a challenging
    task due to the abrupt nature of the language used in tweets. In this study, we
    introduce a feature-rich approach based on using supervised machine learning methods
    to segment hashtags. Our approach is unsupervised in the sense that instead of
    using manually segmented hashtags for training the machine learning classifiers,
    we automatically create our training data by using tweets as well as by automatically
    extracting hashtag segmentations from a large corpus. We achieve promising results
    with such automatically created noisy training data.

  abstract: "Language varies not only between countries, but also along regional and\
    \ socio-demographic lines. This variation is one of the driving factors behind\
    \ language change. However, investigating language variation is a complex undertaking:\
    \ the more factors we want to consider, the more data we need. Traditional qualitative\
    \ methods are not well-suited to do this, an therefore restricted to isolated\
    \ factors. This reduction limits the potential insights, and risks attributing\
    \ undue importance to easily observed factors. While there is a large interest\
    \ in linguistics to increase the quantitative aspect of such studies, it requires\
    \ training in both variational linguistics and computational methods, a combination\
    \ that is still not common. We take a first step here to alleviating the problem\
    \ by providing an interface, www.languagevariation.com, to explore large-scale\
    \ language variation along multiple socio-demographic factors \u2013 without programming\
    \ knowledge. It makes use of large amounts of data and provides statistical analyses,\
    \ maps, and interactive features that will enable scholars to explore language\
    \ variation in a data-driven way."

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present a study on tweet classification which aims
    to define the communication behavior of the 103 French museums that participated
    in 2014 in the Twitter operation: MuseumWeek. The tweets were automatically classified
    in four communication categories: sharing experience, promoting participation,
    interacting with the community, and promoting-informing about the institution.
    Our classification is multi-class. It combines Support Vector Machines and Naive
    Bayes methods and is supported by a selection of eighteen subtypes of features
    of four different kinds: metadata information, punctuation marks, tweet-specific
    and lexical features. It was tested against a corpus of 1,095 tweets manually
    annotated by two experts in Natural Language Processing and Information Communication
    and twelve Community Managers of French museums. We obtained an state-of-the-art
    result of F1-score of 72% by 10-fold cross-validation. This result is very encouraging
    since is even better than some state-of-the-art results found in the tweet classification
    literature.'

  abstract: 'Word sense induction (WSI) seeks to induce senses of words from unannotated
    corpora. In this paper, we address the WSI task for the Croatian language. We
    adopt the word clustering approach based on co-occurrence graphs, in which senses
    are taken to correspond to strongly inter-connected components of co-occurring
    words. We experiment with a number of graph construction techniques and clustering
    algorithms, and evaluate the sense inventories both as a clustering problem and
    extrinsically on a word sense disambiguation (WSD) task. In the cluster-based
    evaluation, Chinese Whispers algorithm outperformed Markov Clustering, yielding
    a normalized mutual information score of 64.3. In contrast, in WSD evaluation
    Markov Clustering performed better, yielding an accuracy of about 75%. We are
    making available two induced sense inventories of 10,000 most frequent Croatian
    words: one coarse-grained and one fine-grained inventory, both obtained using
    the Markov Clustering algorithm.'

  abstract: We describe the word sense annotation layer in Eukalyptus, a freely available
    five-domain corpus of contemporary Swedish with several annotation layers. The
    annotation uses the SALDO lexicon to define the sense inventory, and allows word
    sense annotation of compound segments and multiword units. We give an overview
    of the new annotation tool developed for this project, and finally present an
    analysis of the inter-annotator agreement between two annotators.

    NLP tools, including lemma and part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition
    and classification, named-entity disambiguation, word-sense disambiguation, and
    coreference. The corpora comprise both the well-known Europarl corpus and a domain-specific
    question-answer troubleshooting corpus on the IT domain. English is common in
    all parallel corpora, with translations in five languages, namely, Basque, Bulgarian,
    Czech, Portuguese and Spanish. We describe the annotated corpora and the tools
    used for annotation, as well as annotation statistics for each language. These
    new resources are freely available and will help research on semantic processing
    for machine translation and cross-lingual transfer.

  abstract: We present a VerbNet-based annotation scheme for semantic roles that we
    explore in an annotation study on German language data that combines word sense
    and semantic role annotation. We reannotate a substantial portion of the SALSA
    corpus with GermaNet senses and a revised scheme of VerbNet roles. We provide
    a detailed evaluation of the interaction between sense and role annotation. The
    resulting corpus will allow us to compare VerbNet role annotation for German to
    FrameNet and PropBank annotation by mapping to existing role annotations on the
    SALSA corpus. We publish the annotated corpus and detailed guidelines for the
    new role annotation scheme.

  abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the open problems in the area
    of natural language processing. Various supervised, unsupervised and knowledge
    based approaches have been proposed for automatically determining the sense of
    a word in a particular context. It has been observed that such approaches often
    find it difficult to beat the WordNet First Sense (WFS) baseline which assigns
    the sense irrespective of context. In this paper, we present our work on creating
    the WFS baseline for Hindi language by manually ranking the synsets of Hindi WordNet.
    A ranking tool is developed where human experts can see the frequency of the word
    senses in the sense-tagged corpora and have been asked to rank the senses of a
    word by using this information and also his/her intuition. The accuracy of WFS
    baseline is tested on several standard datasets. F-score is found to be 60%, 65%
    and 55% on Health, Tourism and News datasets respectively. The created rankings
    can also be used in other NLP applications viz., Machine Translation, Information
    Retrieval, Text Summarization, etc.

  abstract: In this paper, a new approach towards semantic clustering of the results
    of ambiguous search queries is presented. We propose using distributed vector
    representations of words trained with the help of prediction-based neural embedding
    models to detect senses of search queries and to cluster search engine results
    page according to these senses. The words from titles and snippets together with
    semantic relationships between them form a graph, which is further partitioned
    into components related to different query senses. This approach to search engine
    results clustering is evaluated against a new manually annotated evaluation data
    set of Russian search queries. We show that in the task of semantically clustering
    search results, prediction-based models slightly but stably outperform traditional
    count-based ones, with the same training corpora.

  abstract: The task of automatically generating sentential descriptions of image
    content has become increasingly popular in recent years, resulting in the development
    of large-scale image description datasets and the proposal of various metrics
    for evaluating image description generation systems. However, not much work has
    been done to analyse and understand both datasets and the metrics. In this paper,
    we propose using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) process as a means to
    analyse multiply annotated, human-authored image description datasets and the
    various evaluation metrics, i.e. evaluating one image description against other
    human-authored descriptions of the same image. Such an evaluation process affords
    various insights into the image description datasets and evaluation metrics, such
    as the variations of image descriptions within and across datasets and also what
    the metrics capture. We compute and analyse (i) human upper-bound performance;
    (ii) ranked correlation between metric pairs across datasets; (iii) lower-bound
    performance by comparing a set of descriptions describing one image to another
    sentence not describing that image. Interesting observations are made about the
    evaluation metrics and image description datasets, and we conclude that such cross-validation
    methods are extremely useful for assessing and gaining insights into image description
    datasets and evaluation metrics for image descriptions.

  abstract: In American Sign Language (ASL) as well as other signed languages, different
    classes of signs (e.g., lexical signs, fingerspelled signs, and classifier constructions)
    have different internal structural properties. Continuous sign recognition accuracy
    can be improved through use of distinct recognition strategies, as well as different
    training datasets, for each class of signs. For these strategies to be applied,
    continuous signing video needs to be segmented into parts corresponding to particular
    classes of signs. In this paper we present a multiple instance learning-based
    segmentation system that accurately labels 91.27% of the video frames of 500 continuous
    utterances (including 7 different subjects) from the publicly accessible NCSLGR
    corpus (Neidle and Vogler, 2012). The system uses novel feature descriptors derived
    from both motion and shape statistics of the regions of high local motion. The
    system does not require a hand tracker.

  abstract: 'Lexical Simplification is the task of replacing complex words in a text
    with simpler alternatives. A variety of strategies have been devised for this
    challenge, yet there has been little effort in comparing their performance. In
    this contribution, we present a benchmarking of several Lexical Simplification
    systems. By combining resources created in previous work with automatic spelling
    and inflection correction techniques, we introduce BenchLS: a new evaluation dataset
    for the task. Using BenchLS, we evaluate the performance of solutions for various
    steps in the typical Lexical Simplification pipeline, both individually and jointly.
    This is the first time Lexical Simplification systems are compared in such fashion
    on the same data, and the findings introduce many contributions to the field,
    revealing several interesting properties of the systems evaluated.'

  abstract: Scientific literature records the research process with a standardized
    structure and provides the clues to track the progress in a scientific field.
    Understanding its internal structure and content is of paramount importance for
    natural language processing (NLP) technologies. To meet this requirement, we have
    developed a multi-layered annotated corpus of scientific papers in the domain
    of Computer Graphics. Sentences are annotated with respect to their role in the
    argumentative structure of the discourse. The purpose of each citation is specified.
    Special features of the scientific discourse such as advantages and disadvantages
    are identified. In addition, a grade is allocated to each sentence according to
    its relevance for being included in a summary.To the best of our knowledge, this
    complex, multi-layered collection of annotations and metadata characterizing a
    set of research papers had never been grouped together before in one corpus and
    therefore constitutes a newer, richer resource with respect to those currently
    available in the field.

  abstract: In this paper we report a comparison of various techniques for single-document
    extractive summarization under strict length budgets, which is a common commercial
    use case (e.g. summarization of news articles by news aggregators). We show that,
    evaluated using ROUGE, numerous algorithms from the literature fail to beat a
    simple lead-based baseline for this task. However, a supervised approach with
    lightweight and efficient features improves over the lead-based baseline. Additional
    human evaluation demonstrates that the supervised approach also performs competitively
    with a commercial system that uses more sophisticated features.

  abstract: Automatic summarization of reader comments in on-line news is an extremely
    challenging task and a capability for which there is a clear need. Work to date
    has focussed on producing extractive summaries using well-known techniques imported
    from other areas of language processing. But are extractive summaries of comments
    what users really want? Do they support users in performing the sorts of tasks
    they are likely to want to perform with reader comments? In this paper we address
    these questions by doing three things. First, we offer a specification of one
    possible summary type for reader comment, based on an analysis of reader comment
    in terms of issues and viewpoints. Second, we define a task-based evaluation framework
    for reader comment summarization that allows summarization systems to be assessed
    in terms of how well they support users in a time-limited task of identifying
    issues and characterising opinion on issues in comments. Third, we describe a
    pilot evaluation in which we used the task-based evaluation framework to evaluate
    a prototype reader comment clustering and summarization system, demonstrating
    the viability of the evaluation framework and illustrating the sorts of insight
    such an evaluation affords.

  abstract: "Unsupervised learning of morphological segmentation of words in a language,\
    \ based only on a large corpus of words, is a challenging task. Evaluation of\
    \ the learned segmentations is a challenge in itself, due to the inherent ambiguity\
    \ of the segmentation task. There is no way to posit unique \u201Ccorrect\u201D\
    \ segmentation for a set of data in an objective way. Two models may arrive at\
    \ different ways of segmenting the data, which may nonetheless both be valid.\
    \ Several evaluation methods have been proposed to date, but they do not insist\
    \ on consistency of the evaluated model. We introduce a new evaluation methodology,\
    \ which enforces correctness of segmentation boundaries while also assuring consistency\
    \ of segmentation decisions across the corpus."

  abstract: "Bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is usually based\
    \ on distributional methods when dealing with single word terms (SWT). These methods\
    \ often treat SWT as single tokens without considering their compositional property.\
    \ However, many SWT are compositional (composed of roots and affixes) and this\
    \ information, if taken into account can be very useful to match translational\
    \ pairs, especially for infrequent terms where distributional methods often fail.\
    \ For instance, the English compound xenograft which is composed of the root xeno\
    \ and the lexeme graft can be translated into French compositionally by aligning\
    \ each of its elements (xeno with x\xE9no and graft with greffe) resulting in\
    \ the translation: x\xE9nogreffe. In this paper, we experiment several distributional\
    \ modellings at the morpheme level that we apply to perform compositional translation\
    \ to a subset of French and English compounds. We show promising results using\
    \ distributional analysis at the root and affix levels. We also show that the\
    \ adapted approach significantly improve bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable\
    \ corpora compared to the approach at the word level."

    \ is useful for seeding morphological analysis and generation software, particularly\

  abstract: Wiktionary is a large-scale resource for cross-lingual lexical information
    with great potential utility for machine translation (MT) and many other NLP tasks,
    especially automatic morphological analysis and generation. However, it is designed
    primarily for human viewing rather than machine readability, and presents numerous
    challenges for generalized parsing and extraction due to a lack of standardized
    formatting and grammatical descriptor definitions. This paper describes a large-scale
    effort to automatically extract and standardize the data in Wiktionary and make
    it available for use by the NLP research community. The methodological innovations
    include a multidimensional table parsing algorithm, a cross-lexeme, token-frequency-based
    method of separating inflectional form data from grammatical descriptors, the
    normalization of grammatical descriptors to a unified annotation scheme that accounts
    for cross-linguistic diversity, and a verification and correction process that
    exploits within-language, cross-lexeme table format consistency to minimize human
    effort. The effort described here resulted in the extraction of a uniquely large
    normalized resource of nearly 1,000,000 inflectional paradigms across 350 languages.
    Evaluation shows that even though the data is extracted using a language-independent
    approach, it is comparable in quantity and quality to data extracted using hand-tuned,
    language-specific approaches.

  abstract: Users will interact with an individual app on smart devices (e.g., phone,
    TV, car) to fulfill a specific goal (e.g. find a photographer), but users may
    also pursue more complex tasks that will span multiple domains and apps (e.g.
    plan a wedding ceremony). Planning and executing such multi-app tasks are typically
    managed by users, considering the required global context awareness. To investigate
    how users arrange domains/apps to fulfill complex tasks in their daily life, we
    conducted a user study on 14 participants to collect such data from their Android
    smart phones. This document 1) summarizes the techniques used in the data collection
    and 2) provides a brief statistical description of the data. This data guilds
    the future direction for researchers in the fields of conversational agent and
    personal assistant, etc. This data is available at http://AppDialogue.com.

  abstract: "The paper describes experimental dialogue data collection activities,\
    \ as well semantically annotated corpus creation undertaken within EU-funded METALOGUE\
    \ project(www.metalogue.eu). The project aims to develop a dialogue system with\
    \ flexible dialogue management to enable system\u2019s adaptive, reactive, interactive\
    \ and proactive dialogue behavior in setting goals, choosing appropriate strategies\
    \ and monitoring numerous parallel interpretation and management processes. To\
    \ achieve these goals negotiation (or more precisely multi-issue bargaining) scenario\
    \ has been considered as the specific setting and application domain. The dialogue\
    \ corpus forms the basis for the design of task and interaction models of participants\
    \ negotiation behavior, and subsequently for dialogue system development which\
    \ would be capable to replace one of the negotiators. The METALOGUE corpus will\
    \ be released to the community for research purposes."

  abstract: "Annotated in-domain corpora are crucial to the successful development\
    \ of dialogue systems of automated agents, and in particular for developing natural\
    \ language understanding (NLU) components of such systems. Unfortunately, such\
    \ important resources are scarce. In this work, we introduce an annotated natural\
    \ language human-agent dialogue corpus in the negotiation domain. The corpus was\
    \ collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk following the \u2018Wizard-Of-Oz\u2019\
    \ approach, where a \u2018wizard\u2019 human translates the participants\u2019\
    \ natural language utterances in real time into a semantic language. Once dialogue\
    \ collection was completed, utterances were annotated with intent labels by two\
    \ independent annotators, achieving high inter-annotator agreement. Our initial\
    \ experiments with an SVM classifier show that automatically inferring such labels\
    \ from the utterances is far from trivial. We make our corpus publicly available\
    \ to serve as an aid in the development of dialogue systems for negotiation agents,\
    \ and suggest that analogous corpora can be created following our methodology\
    \ and using our available source code. To the best of our knowledge this is the\
    \ first publicly available negotiation dialogue corpus."

  abstract: This paper presents the DialogBank, a new language resource consisting
    of dialogues with gold standard annotations according to the ISO 24617-2 standard.
    Some of these dialogues have been taken from existing corpora and have been re-annotated
    according to the ISO standard; others have been annotated directly according to
    the standard. The ISO 24617-2 annotations have been designed according to the
    ISO principles for semantic annotation, as formulated in ISO 24617-6. The DialogBank
    makes use of three alternative representation formats, which are shown to be interoperable.

  abstract: "The Artwalk Corpus is a collection of 48 mobile phone conversations between\
    \ 24 pairs of friends and 24 pairs of strangers performing a novel, naturalistically-situated\
    \ referential communication task. This task produced dialogues which, on average,\
    \ are just under 40 minutes. The task requires the identification of public art\
    \ while walking around and navigating pedestrian routes in the downtown area of\
    \ Santa Cruz, California. The task involves a Director on the UCSC campus with\
    \ access to maps providing verbal instructions to a Follower executing the task.\
    \ The task provides a setting for real-world situated dialogic language and is\
    \ designed to: (1) elicit entrainment and coordination of referring expressions\
    \ between the dialogue participants, (2) examine the effect of friendship on dialogue\
    \ strategies, and (3) examine how the need to complete the task while negotiating\
    \ myriad, unanticipated events in the real world \u2015 such as avoiding cars\
    \ and other pedestrians \u2015 affects linguistic coordination and other dialogue\
    \ behaviors. Previous work on entrainment and coordinating communication has primarily\
    \ focused on similar tasks in laboratory settings where there are no interruptions\
    \ and no need to navigate from one point to another in a complex space. The corpus\
    \ provides a general resource for studies on how coordinated task-oriented dialogue\
    \ changes when we move outside the laboratory and into the world. It can also\
    \ be used for studies of entrainment in dialogue, and the form and style of pedestrian\
    \ instruction dialogues, as well as the effect of friendship on dialogic behaviors."

  abstract: "We introduce a dialogue task between a virtual patient and a doctor where\
    \ the dialogue system, playing the patient part in a simulated consultation, must\
    \ reconcile a specialized level, to understand what the doctor says, and a lay\
    \ level, to output realistic patient-language utterances. This increases the challenges\
    \ in the analysis and generation phases of the dialogue. This paper proposes methods\
    \ to manage linguistic and terminological variation in that situation and illustrates\
    \ how they help produce realistic dialogues. Our system makes use of lexical resources\
    \ for processing synonyms, inflectional and derivational variants, or pronoun/verb\
    \ agreement. In addition, specialized knowledge is used for processing medical\
    \ roots and affixes, ontological relations and concept mapping, and for generating\
    \ lay variants of terms according to the patient\u2019s non-expert discourse.\
    \ We also report the results of a first evaluation carried out by 11 users interacting\
    \ with the system. We evaluated the non-contextual analysis module, which supports\
    \ the Spoken Language Understanding step. The annotation of task domain entities\
    \ obtained 91.8% of Precision, 82.5% of Recall, 86.9% of F-measure, 19.0% of Slot\
    \ Error Rate, and 32.9% of Sentence Error Rate."

  abstract: We present a corpus of virtual patient dialogues to which we have added
    manually annotated gold standard word alignments. Since each question asked by
    a medical student in the dialogues is mapped to a canonical, anticipated version
    of the question, the corpus implicitly defines a large set of paraphrase (and
    non-paraphrase) pairs. We also present a novel process for selecting the most
    useful data to annotate with word alignments and for ensuring consistent paraphrase
    status decisions. In support of this process, we have enhanced the earlier Edinburgh
    alignment tool (Cohn et al., 2008) and revised and extended the Edinburgh guidelines,
    in particular adding guidance intended to ensure that the word alignments are
    consistent with the overall paraphrase status decision. The finished corpus and
    the enhanced alignment tool are made freely available.

  abstract: There have been several attempts to annotate communicative functions to
    utterances of verbal feedback in English previously. Here, we suggest an annotation
    scheme for verbal and non-verbal feedback utterances in French including the categories
    base, attitude, previous and visual. The data comprises conversations, maptasks
    and negotiations from which we extracted ca. 13,000 candidate feedback utterances
    and gestures. 12 students were recruited for the annotation campaign of ca. 9,500
    instances. Each instance was annotated by between 2 and 7 raters. The evaluation
    of the annotation agreement resulted in an average best-pair kappa of 0.6. While
    the base category with the values acknowledgement, evaluation, answer, elicit
    achieve good agreement, this is not the case for the other main categories. The
    data sets, which also include automatic extractions of lexical, positional and
    acoustic features, are freely available and will further be used for machine learning
    classification experiments to analyse the form-function relationship of feedback.

  abstract: We developed a web application for crowdsourcing transcriptions of Dutch
    words spoken by Spanish L2 learners. In this paper we discuss the design of the
    application and the influence of metadata and various forms of feedback. Useful
    data were obtained from 159 participants, with an average of over 20 transcriptions
    per item, which seems a satisfactory result for this type of research. Informing
    participants about how many items they still had to complete, and not how many
    they had already completed, turned to be an incentive to do more items. Assigning
    participants a score for their performance made it more attractive for them to
    carry out the transcription task, but this seemed to influence their performance.
    We discuss possible advantages and disadvantages in connection with the aim of
    the research and consider possible lessons for designing future experiments.

  abstract: The Uppsala Corpus of Student Writings consists of Swedish texts produced
    as part of a national test of students ranging in age from nine (in year three
    of primary school) to nineteen (the last year of upper secondary school) who are
    studying either Swedish or Swedish as a second language. National tests have been
    collected since 1996. The corpus currently consists of 2,500 texts containing
    over 1.5 million tokens. Parts of the texts have been annotated on several linguistic
    levels using existing state-of-the-art natural language processing tools. In order
    to make the corpus easy to interpret for scholars in the humanities, we chose
    the CoNLL format instead of an XML-based representation. Since spelling and grammatical
    errors are common in student writings, the texts are automatically corrected while
    keeping the original tokens in the corpus. Each token is annotated with part-of-speech
    and morphological features as well as syntactic structure. The main purpose of
    the corpus is to facilitate the systematic and quantitative empirical study of
    the writings of various student groups based on gender, geographic area, age,
    grade awarded or a combination of these, synchronically or diachronically. The
    intention is for this to be a monitor corpus, currently under development.

    s weekly writing over the course of 3 months in 2nd and 3rd grades, aged 7-11.\
    \ The texts were collected within the normal classroom setting by the teacher.\
    \ Texts of children whose parents signed the permission to donate the texts to\
    \ science were collected and transcribed. The corpus consists of the elicitation\
    \ techniques, an overview of the data collected and the transcriptions of the\
    \ texts both with and without spelling errors, aligned on a word by word basis,\
    \ as well as the scanned in texts. The corpus is available for research via Linguistic\
    \ Data Consortium (LDC). Researchers are strongly encouraged to make additional\
    \ annotations and improvements and return it to the public domain via LDC."

  abstract: We present the COPLE2 corpus, a learner corpus of Portuguese that includes
    written and spoken texts produced by learners of Portuguese as a second or foreign
    language. The corpus includes at the moment a total of 182,474 tokens and 978
    texts, classified according to the CEFR scales. The original handwritten productions
    are transcribed in TEI compliant XML format and keep record of all the original
    information, such as reformulations, insertions and corrections made by the teacher,
    while the recordings are transcribed and aligned with EXMARaLDA. The TEITOK environment
    enables different views of the same document (XML, student version, corrected
    version), a CQP-based search interface, the POS, lemmatization and normalization
    of the tokens, and will soon be used for error annotation in stand-off format.
    The corpus has already been a source of data for phonological, lexical and syntactic
    interlanguage studies and will be used for a data-informed selection of language
    features for each proficiency level.

  abstract: 'The French Learners Audio Corpus of German Speech (FLACGS) was created
    to compare German speech production of German native speakers (GG) and French
    learners of German (FG) across three speech production tasks of increasing production
    complexity: repetition, reading and picture description. 40 speakers, 20 GG and
    20 FG performed each of the three tasks, which in total leads to approximately
    7h of speech. The corpus was manually transcribed and automatically aligned. Analysis
    that can be performed on this type of corpus are for instance segmental differences
    in the speech production of L2 learners compared to native speakers. We chose
    the realization of the velar nasal consonant engma. In spoken French, engma does
    not appear in a VCV context which leads to production difficulties in FG. With
    increasing speech production complexity (reading and picture description), engma
    is realized as engma + plosive by FG in over 50% of the cases. The results of
    a two way ANOVA with unequal sample sizes on the durations of the different realizations
    of engma indicate that duration is a reliable factor to distinguish between engma
    and engma + plosive in FG productions compared to the engma productions in GG
    in a VCV context. The FLACGS corpus allows to study L2 production and perception.'

  abstract: In the paper authors present the Croatian corpus of non-professional written
    language. Consisting of two subcorpora, i.e. the clinical subcorpus, consisting
    of written texts produced by speakers with various types of language disorders,
    and the healthy speakers subcorpus, as well as by the levels of its annotation,
    it offers an opportunity for different lines of research. The authors present
    the corpus structure, describe the sampling methodology, explain the levels of
    annotation, and give some very basic statistics. On the basis of data from the
    corpus, existing language technologies for Croatian are adapted in order to be
    implemented in a platform facilitating text production to speakers with language
    disorders. In this respect, several analyses of the corpus data and a basic evaluation
    of the developed technologies are presented.

  abstract: "We are presenting our work on the creation of the first optical character\
    \ recognition (OCR) model for Northern Haida, also known as Masset or Xaad Kil,\
    \ a nearly extinct First Nations language spoken in the Haida Gwaii archipelago\
    \ in British Columbia, Canada. We are addressing the challenges of training an\
    \ OCR model for a language with an extensive, non-standard Latin character set\
    \ as follows: (1) We have compared various training approaches and present the\
    \ results of practical analyses to maximize recognition accuracy and minimize\
    \ manual labor. An approach using just one or two pages of Source Images directly\
    \ performed better than the Image Generation approach, and better than models\
    \ based on three or more pages. Analyses also suggest that a character\u2019s\
    \ frequency is directly correlated with its recognition accuracy. (2) We present\
    \ an overview of current OCR accuracy analysis tools available. (3) We have ported\
    \ the once de-facto standardized OCR accuracy tools to be able to cope with Unicode\
    \ input. Our work adds to a growing body of research on OCR for particularly challenging\
    \ character sets, and contributes to creating the largest electronic corpus for\
    \ this severely endangered language."

  abstract: This is a report of findings from on-going language documentation research
    based on three consecutive projects from 2008 to 2016. In the light of this research,
    we propose that (1) we should stand on the side of language resource producers
    to enhance the research of language processing. We support personal data management
    in addition to social data sharing. (2) This support leads to adopting simple
    data formats instead of the multi-link-path data models proposed as international
    standards up to the present. (3) We should set up a framework for total language
    resource study that includes not only pivotal data formats such as standard formats,
    but also the surroundings of data formation to capture a wider range of language
    activities, e.g. annotation, hesitant language formation, and reference-referent
    relations. A study of this framework is expected to be a foundation of rebuilding
    man-machine interface studies in which we seek to observe generative processes
    of informational symbols in order to establish a high affinity interface in regard
    to documentation.

  abstract: Poor digital representation of minority languages further prevents their
    usability on digital media and devices. The Digital Language Diversity Project,
    a three-year project funded under the Erasmus+ programme, aims at addressing the
    problem of low digital representation of EU regional and minority languages by
    giving their speakers the intellectual an practical skills to create, share, and
    reuse online digital content. Availability of digital content and technical support
    to use it are essential prerequisites for the development of language-based digital
    applications, which in turn can boost digital usage of these languages. In this
    paper we introduce the project, its aims, objectives and current activities for
    sustaining digital usability of minority languages through adult education.

  abstract: In this paper, we illustrate the integration of an online dialectometric
    tool, Gabmap, together with an online dialect atlas, the Atlante Lessicale Toscano
    (ALT-Web). By using a newly created url-based interface to Gabmap, ALT-Web is
    able to take advantage of the sophisticated dialect visualization and exploration
    options incorporated in Gabmap. For example, distribution maps showing the distribution
    in the Tuscan dialect area of a specific dialectal form (selected via the ALT-Web
    website) are easily obtainable. Furthermore, the complete ALT-Web dataset as well
    as subsets of the data (selected via the ALT-Web website) can be automatically
    uploaded and explored in Gabmap. By combining these two online applications, macro-
    and micro-analyses of dialectal data (respectively offered by Gabmap and ALT-Web)
    are effectively and dynamically combined.

  abstract: "In this paper, we describe the textual linguistic resources in nearly\
    \ 3 dozen languages being produced by Linguistic Data Consortium for DARPA\u2019\
    s LORELEI (Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents) Program. The goal of\
    \ LORELEI is to improve the performance of human language technologies for low-resource\
    \ languages and enable rapid re-training of such technologies for new languages,\
    \ with a focus on the use case of deployment of resources in sudden emergencies\
    \ such as natural disasters. Representative languages have been selected to provide\
    \ broad typological coverage for training, and surprise incident languages for\
    \ testing will be selected over the course of the program. Our approach treats\
    \ the full set of language packs as a coherent whole, maintaining LORELEI-wide\
    \ specifications, tagsets, and guidelines, while allowing for adaptation to the\
    \ specific needs created by each language. Each representative language corpus,\
    \ therefore, both stands on its own as a resource for the specific language and\
    \ forms part of a large multilingual resource for broader cross-language technology\

    We analyze the differences between Romanian and its dialects using the Swadesh
    list. We analyze the predictive power of the orthographic and phonetic features
    of the words, building a classification problem for dialect identification.

  abstract: The lack or absence of parallel and comparable corpora makes bilingual
    lexicon extraction becomes a difficult task for low-resource languages. Pivot
    language and cognate recognition approach have been proven useful to induce bilingual
    lexicons for such languages. We analyze the features of closely related languages
    and define a semantic constraint assumption. Based on the assumption, we propose
    a constraint-based bilingual lexicon induction for closely related languages by
    extending constraints and translation pair candidates from recent pivot language
    approach. We further define three constraint sets based on language characteristics.
    In this paper, two controlled experiments are conducted. The former involves four
    closely related language pairs with different language pair similarities, and
    the latter focuses on sense connectivity between non-pivot words and pivot words.
    We evaluate our result with F-measure. The result indicates that our method works
    better on voluminous input dictionaries and high similarity languages. Finally,
    we introduce a strategy to use proper constraint sets for different goals and
    language characteristics.

  abstract: 'For publishing sign language corpus data on the web, anonymization is
    crucial even if it is impossible to hide the visual appearance of the signers:
    In a small community, even vague references to third persons may be enough to
    identify those persons. In the case of the DGS Korpus (German Sign Language corpus)
    project, we want to publish data as a contribution to the cultural heritage of
    the sign language community while annotation of the data is still ongoing. This
    poses the question how well anonymization can be achieved given that no full linguistic
    analysis of the data is available. Basically, we combine analysis of all data
    that we have, including named entity recognition on translations into German.
    For this, we use the WebLicht language technology infrastructure. We report on
    the reliability of these methods in this special context and also illustrate how
    the anonymization of the video data is technically achieved in order to minimally
    disturb the viewer.'

  abstract: In this paper we present a gold standard dataset for Entity Linking (EL)
    in the Music Domain. It contains thousands of musical named entities such as Artist,
    Song or Record Label, which have been automatically annotated on a set of artist
    biographies coming from the Music website and social network Last.fm. The annotation
    process relies on the analysis of the hyperlinks present in the source texts and
    in a voting-based algorithm for EL, which considers, for each entity mention in
    text, the degree of agreement across three state-of-the-art EL systems. Manual
    evaluation shows that EL Precision is at least 94%, and due to its tunable nature,
    it is possible to derive annotations favouring higher Precision or Recall, at
    will. We make available the annotated dataset along with evaluation data and the
    code.

  abstract: We describe a corpus of consumer health questions annotated with named
    entities. The corpus consists of 1548 de-identified questions about diseases and
    drugs, written in English. We defined 15 broad categories of biomedical named
    entities for annotation. A pilot annotation phase in which a small portion of
    the corpus was double-annotated by four annotators was followed by a main phase
    in which double annotation was carried out by six annotators, and a reconciliation
    phase in which all annotations were reconciled by an expert. We conducted the
    annotation in two modes, manual and assisted, to assess the effect of automatic
    pre-annotation and calculated inter-annotator agreement. We obtained moderate
    inter-annotator agreement; assisted annotation yielded slightly better agreement
    and fewer missed annotations than manual annotation. Due to complex nature of
    biomedical entities, we paid particular attention to nested entities for which
    we obtained slightly lower inter-annotator agreement, confirming that annotating
    nested entities is somewhat more challenging. To our knowledge, the corpus is
    the first of its kind for consumer health text and is publicly available.

  abstract: This paper presents a German corpus for Named Entity Linking (NEL) and
    Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks. We describe the annotation guideline, the
    annotation process, NIL clustering techniques and conversion to popular NEL formats
    such as NIF and TAC that have been used to construct this corpus based on news
    transcripts from the German regional broadcaster RBB (Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg).
    Since creating such language resources requires significant effort, the paper
    also discusses how to derive additional evaluation resources for tasks like named
    entity contextualization or ontology enrichment by exploiting the links between
    named entities from the annotated corpus. The paper concludes with an evaluation
    that shows how several well-known NEL tools perform on the corpus, a discussion
    of the evaluation results, and with suggestions on how to keep evaluation corpora
    and datasets up to date.

  abstract: The ever increasing importance of machine learning in Natural Language
    Processing is accompanied by an equally increasing need in large-scale training
    and evaluation corpora. Due to its size, its openness and relative quality, the
    Wikipedia has already been a source of such data, but on a limited scale. This
    paper introduces the DBpedia Abstract Corpus, a large-scale, open corpus of annotated
    Wikipedia texts in six languages, featuring over 11 million texts and over 97
    million entity links. The properties of the Wikipedia texts are being described,
    as well as the corpus creation process, its format and interesting use-cases,
    like Named Entity Linking training and evaluation.

  abstract: This paper describes the named entity language resources developed as
    part of a development project for the South African languages. The development
    efforts focused on creating protocols and annotated data sets with at least 15,000
    annotated named entity tokens for ten of the official South African languages.
    The description of the protocols and annotated data sets provide an overview of
    the problems encountered during the annotation of the data sets. Based on these
    annotated data sets, CRF named entity recognition systems are developed that leverage
    existing linguistic resources. The newly created named entity recognisers are
    evaluated, with F-scores of between 0.64 and 0.77, and error analysis is performed
    to identify possible avenues for improving the quality of the systems.

  abstract: Recognition of real-world entities is crucial for most NLP applications.
    Since its introduction some twenty years ago, named entity processing has undergone
    a significant evolution with, among others, the definition of new tasks (e.g.
    entity linking) and the emergence of new types of data (e.g. speech transcriptions,
    micro-blogging). These pose certainly new challenges which affect not only methods
    and algorithms but especially linguistic resources. Where do we stand with respect
    to named entity resources? This paper aims at providing a systematic overview
    of named entity resources, accounting for qualities such as multilingualism, dynamicity
    and interoperability, and to identify shortfalls in order to guide future developments.

  abstract: This paper explores the incorporation of lexico-semantic heuristics into
    a deterministic Coreference Resolution (CR) system for classifying named entities
    at document-level. The highest precise sieves of a CR tool are enriched with both
    a set of heuristics for merging named entities labeled with different classes
    and also with some constraints that avoid the incorrect merging of similar mentions.
    Several tests show that this strategy improves both NER labeling and CR. The CR
    tool can be applied in combination with any system for named entity recognition
    using the CoNLL format, and brings benefits to text analytics tasks such as Information
    Extraction. Experiments were carried out in Spanish, using three different NER
    tools.

  abstract: In this paper we investigate the usefulness of neural word embeddings
    in the process of translating Named Entities (NEs) from a resource-rich language
    to a language low on resources relevant to the task at hand, introducing a novel,
    yet simple way of obtaining bilingual word vectors. Inspired by observations in
    (Mikolov et al., 2013b), which show that training their word vector model on comparable
    corpora yields comparable vector space representations of those corpora, reducing
    the problem of translating words to finding a rotation matrix, and results in
    (Zou et al., 2013), which showed that bilingual word embeddings can improve Chinese
    Named Entity Recognition (NER) and English to Chinese phrase translation, we use
    the sentence-aligned English-French EuroParl corpora and show that word embeddings
    extracted from a merged corpus (corpus resulted from the merger of the two aligned
    corpora) can be used to NE translation. We extrapolate that word embeddings trained
    on merged parallel corpora are useful in Named Entity Recognition and Translation
    tasks for resource-poor languages.

  abstract: The task of relation extraction is to recognize and extract relations
    between entities or concepts in texts. Dependency parse trees have become a popular
    source for discovering extraction patterns, which encode the grammatical relations
    among the phrases that jointly express relation instances. State-of-the-art weakly
    supervised approaches to relation extraction typically extract thousands of unique
    patterns only potentially expressing the target relation. Among these patterns,
    some are semantically equivalent, but differ in their morphological, lexical-semantic
    or syntactic form. Some express a relation that entails the target relation. We
    propose a new approach to structuring extraction patterns by utilizing entailment
    graphs, hierarchical structures representing entailment relations, and present
    a novel resource of gold-standard entailment graphs based on a set of patterns
    automatically acquired using distant supervision. We describe the methodology
    used for creating the dataset and present statistics of the resource as well as
    an analysis of inference types underlying the entailment decisions.

  abstract: "Bar exams provide a key watershed by which legal professionals demonstrate\
    \ their knowledge of the law and its application. Passing the bar entitles one\
    \ to practice the law in a given jurisdiction. The bar provides an excellent benchmark\
    \ for the performance of legal information systems since passing the bar would\
    \ arguably signal that the system has acquired key aspects of legal reason on\
    \ a par with a human lawyer. The paper provides a corpus and experimental results\
    \ with material derived from a real bar exam, treating the problem as a form of\
    \ textual entailment from the question to an answer. The providers of the bar\

    \ performance measure against which to evaluate future improvements. The reasons\

  abstract: In this paper we present the creation of a corpora annotated with both
    semantic relatedness (SR) scores and textual entailment (TE) judgments. In building
    this corpus we aimed at discovering, if any, the relationship between these two
    tasks for the mutual benefit of resolving one of them by relying on the insights
    gained from the other. We considered a corpora already annotated with TE judgments
    and we proceed to the manual annotation with SR scores. The RTE 1-4 corpora used
    in the PASCAL competition fit our need. The annotators worked independently of
    one each other and they did not have access to the TE judgment during annotation.
    The intuition that the two annotations are correlated received major support from
    this experiment and this finding led to a system that uses this information to
    revise the initial estimates of SR scores. As semantic relatedness is one of the
    most general and difficult task in natural language processing we expect that
    future systems will combine different sources of information in order to solve
    it. Our work suggests that textual entailment plays a quantifiable role in addressing
    it.

  abstract: This paper proposes a new topic model that exploits word sense information
    in order to discover less redundant and more informative topics. Word sense information
    is obtained from WordNet and the discovered topics are groups of synsets, instead
    of mere surface words. A key feature is that all the known senses of a word are
    considered, with their probabilities. Alternative configurations of the model
    are described and compared to each other and to LDA, the most popular topic model.
    However, the obtained results suggest that there are no benefits of enriching
    LDA with word sense information.

  abstract: In this paper we explore and compare a speech and text classification
    approach on a corpus of native and non-native English speakers. We experiment
    on a subset of the International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English containing
    the recorded speeches and the equivalent text transcriptions. Our results suggest
    a high correlation between the spoken and written classification results, showing
    that native accent is highly correlated with grammatical structures found in text.

  abstract: Timeliness and precision for detection of infectious animal disease outbreaks
    from the information published on the web is crucial for prevention against their
    spread. We propose a generic method to enrich and extend the use of different
    expressions as queries in order to improve the acquisition of relevant disease
    related pages on the web. Our method combines a text mining approach to extract
    terms from corpora of relevant disease outbreak documents, and domain expert elicitation
    (Delphi method) to propose expressions and to select relevant combinations between
    terms obtained with text mining. In this paper we evaluated the performance as
    queries of a number of expressions obtained with text mining and validated by
    a domain expert and expressions proposed by a panel of 21 domain experts. We used
    African swine fever as an infectious animal disease model. The expressions obtained
    with text mining outperformed as queries the expressions proposed by domain experts.
    However, domain experts proposed expressions not extracted automatically. Our
    method is simple to conduct and flexible to adapt to any other animal infectious
    disease and even in the public health domain.

  abstract: Privacy concerns have often served as an insurmountable barrier for the
    production of research and resources in clinical information retrieval (IR). We
    believe that both clinical IR research innovation and legitimate privacy concerns
    can be served by the creation of intra-institutional, fully protected resources.
    In this paper, we provide some principles and tools for IR resource-building in
    the unique problem setting of patient-level IR, following the tradition of the
    Cranfield paradigm.

  abstract: Early detection and treatment of diseases that onset after a patient is
    admitted to a hospital, such as pneumonia, is critical to improving and reducing
    costs in healthcare. Previous studies (Tepper et al., 2013) showed that change-of-state
    events in clinical notes could be important cues for phenotype detection. In this
    paper, we extend the annotation schema proposed in (Klassen et al., 2014) to mark
    change-of-state events, diagnosis events, coordination, and negation. After we
    have completed the annotation, we build NLP systems to automatically identify
    named entities and medical events, which yield an f-score of 94.7% and 91.8%,
    respectively.

  abstract: Most Text to Speech (TTS) systems today assume that the input text is
    in a single language and is written in the same language that the text needs to
    be synthesized in. However, in bilingual and multilingual communities, code mixing
    or code switching occurs in speech, in which speakers switch between languages
    in the same utterance. Due to the popularity of social media, we now see code-mixing
    even in text in these multilingual communities. TTS systems capable of synthesizing
    such text need to be able to handle text that is written in multiple languages
    and scripts. Code-mixed text poses many challenges to TTS systems, such as language
    identification, spelling normalization and pronunciation modeling. In this work,
    we describe a preliminary framework for synthesizing code-mixed text. We carry
    out experiments on synthesizing code-mixed Hindi and English text. We find that
    there is a significant user preference for TTS systems that can correctly identify
    and pronounce words in different languages.

  abstract: "This paper describes the development and evaluation of a chatbot platform\
    \ designed for the teaching/learning of Irish. The chatbot uses synthetic voices\
    \ developed for the dialects of Irish. Speech-enabled chatbot technology offers\
    \ a potentially powerful tool for dealing with the challenges of teaching/learning\
    \ an endangered language where learners have limited access to native speaker\
    \ models of the language and limited exposure to the language in a truly communicative\
    \ setting. The sociolinguistic context that motivates the present development\
    \ is explained. The evaluation of the chatbot was carried out in 13 schools by\
    \ 228 pupils and consisted of two parts. Firstly, learners\u2019 opinions of the\
    \ overall chatbot platform as a learning environment were elicited. Secondly,\
    \ learners evaluated the intelligibility, quality, and attractiveness of the synthetic\
    \ voices used in this platform. Results were overwhelmingly positive to both the\
    \ learning platform and the synthetic voices and indicate that the time may now\
    \ be ripe for language learning applications which exploit speech and language\
    \ technologies. It is further argued that these technologies have a particularly\
    \ vital role to play in the maintenance of the endangered language."

  abstract: This paper reports the preservation of an old speech synthesis website
    as a corpus. CHATR was a revolutionary technique developed in the mid nineties
    for concatenative speech synthesis. The method has since become the standard for
    high quality speech output by computer although much of the current research is
    devoted to parametric or hybrid methods that employ smaller amounts of data and
    can be more easily tunable to individual voices. The system was first reported
    in 1994 and the website was functional in 1996. The ATR labs where this system
    was invented no longer exist, but the website has been preserved as a corpus containing
    1537 samples of synthesised speech from that period (118 MB in aiff format) in
    211 pages under various finely interrelated themes The corpus can be accessed
    from www.speech-data.jp as well as www.tcd-fastnet.com, where the original code
    and samples are now being maintained.

  abstract: In order to explore intuitive verbal and non-verbal interfaces in smart
    environments we recorded user interactions with an intelligent apartment. Besides
    offering various interactive capabilities itself, the apartment is also inhabited
    by a social robot that is available as a humanoid interface. This paper presents
    a multi-modal corpus that contains goal-directed actions of naive users in attempts
    to solve a number of predefined tasks. Alongside audio and video recordings, our
    data-set consists of large amount of temporally aligned sensory data and system
    behavior provided by the environment and its interactive components. Non-verbal
    system responses such as changes in light or display contents, as well as robot
    and apartment utterances and gestures serve as a rich basis for later in-depth
    analysis. Manual annotations provide further information about meta data like
    the current course of study and user behavior including the incorporated modality,
    all literal utterances, language features, emotional expressions, foci of attention,
    and addressees.

  abstract: Story-telling is a fundamental and prevalent aspect of human social behavior.
    In the wild, stories are told conversationally in social settings, often as a
    dialogue and with accompanying gestures and other nonverbal behavior. This paper
    presents a new corpus, the Story Dialogue with Gestures (SDG) corpus, consisting
    of 50 personal narratives regenerated as dialogues, complete with annotations
    of gesture placement and accompanying gesture forms. The corpus includes dialogues
    generated by human annotators, gesture annotations on the human generated dialogues,
    videos of story dialogues generated from this representation, video clips of each
    gesture used in the gesture annotations, and annotations of the original personal
    narratives with a deep representation of story called a Story Intention Graph.
    Our long term goal is the automatic generation of story co-tellings as animated
    dialogues from the Story Intention Graph. We expect this corpus to be a useful
    resource for researchers interested in natural language generation, intelligent
    virtual agents, generation of nonverbal behavior, and story and narrative representations.

  abstract: This paper reports on work related to the modelling of Human-Robot Communication
    on the basis of multimodal and multisensory human behaviour analysis. A primary
    focus in this framework of analysis is the definition of semantics of human actions
    in interaction, their capture and their representation in terms of behavioural
    patterns that, in turn, feed a multimodal human-robot communication system. Semantic
    analysis encompasses both oral and sign languages, as well as both verbal and
    non-verbal communicative signals to achieve an effective, natural interaction
    between elderly users with slight walking and cognitive inability and an assistive
    robotic platform.

  abstract: "We present a corpus of 44 human-agent verbal and gestural story retellings\
    \ designed to explore whether humans would gesturally entrain to an embodied intelligent\
    \ virtual agent. We used a novel data collection method where an agent presented\
    \ story components in installments, which the human would then retell to the agent.\
    \ At the end of the installments, the human would then retell the embodied animated\
    \ agent the story as a whole. This method was designed to allow us to observe\
    \ whether changes in the agent\u2019s gestural behavior would result in human\
    \ gestural changes. The agent modified its gestures over the course of the story,\
    \ by starting out the first installment with gestural behaviors designed to manifest\
    \ extraversion, and slowly modifying gestures to express introversion over time,\
    \ or the reverse. The corpus contains the verbal and gestural transcripts of the\
    \ human story retellings. The gestures were coded for type, handedness, temporal\
    \ structure, spatial extent, and the degree to which the participants\u2019 gestures\
    \ match those produced by the agent. The corpus illustrates the variation in expressive\
    \ behaviors produced by users interacting with embodied virtual characters, and\
    \ the degree to which their gestures were influenced by the agent\u2019s dynamic\
    \ changes in personality-based expressive style."

  abstract: 'In order to make the growing amount of conceptual knowledge available
    through ontologies and datasets accessible to humans, NLP applications need access
    to information on how this knowledge can be verbalized in natural language. One
    way to provide this kind of information are ontology lexicons, which apart from
    the actual verbalizations in a given target language can provide further, rich
    linguistic information about them. Compiling such lexicons manually is a very
    time-consuming task and requires expertise both in Semantic Web technologies and
    lexicon engineering, as well as a very good knowledge of the target language at
    hand. In this paper we present an alternative approach to generating ontology
    lexicons by means of crowdsourcing: We use CrowdFlower to generate a small Japanese
    ontology lexicon for ten exemplary ontology elements from the DBpedia ontology
    according to a two-stage workflow, the main underlying idea of which is to turn
    the task of generating lexicon entries into a translation task; the starting point
    of this translation task is a manually created English lexicon for DBpedia. Comparison
    of the results to a manually created Japanese lexicon shows that the presented
    workflow is a viable option if an English seed lexicon is already available.'

  abstract: This paper presents the InScript corpus (Narrative Texts Instantiating
    Script structure). InScript is a corpus of 1,000 stories centered around 10 different
    scenarios. Verbs and noun phrases are annotated with event and participant types,
    respectively. Additionally, the text is annotated with coreference information.
    The corpus shows rich lexical variation and will serve as a unique resource for
    the study of the role of script knowledge in natural language processing.

  abstract: Scripts are standardized event sequences describing typical everyday activities,
    which play an important role in the computational modeling of cognitive abilities
    (in particular for natural language processing). We present a large-scale crowdsourced
    collection of explicit linguistic descriptions of script-specific event sequences
    (40 scenarios with 100 sequences each). The corpus is enriched with crowdsourced
    alignment annotation on a subset of the event descriptions, to be used in future
    work as seed data for automatic alignment of event descriptions (for example via
    clustering). The event descriptions to be aligned were chosen among those expected
    to have the strongest corrective effect on the clustering algorithm. The alignment
    annotation was evaluated against a gold standard of expert annotators. The resulting
    database of partially-aligned script-event descriptions provides a sound empirical
    basis for inducing high-quality script knowledge, as well as for any task involving
    alignment and paraphrase detection of events.

  abstract: 'This paper describes two sets of crowdsourcing experiments on temporal
    information annotation conducted on two languages, i.e., English and Italian.
    The first experiment, launched on the CrowdFlower platform, was aimed at classifying
    temporal relations given target entities. The second one, relying on the CrowdTruth
    metric, consisted in two subtasks: one devoted to the recognition of events and
    temporal expressions and one to the detection and classification of temporal relations.
    The outcomes of the experiments suggest a valuable use of crowdsourcing annotations
    also for a complex task like Temporal Processing.'

  abstract: We present an approach to creating corpora for use in detecting deception
    in text, including a discussion of the challenges peculiar to this task. Our approach
    is based on soliciting several types of reviews from writers and was implemented
    using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We describe the multi-dimensional corpus of reviews
    built using this approach, available free of charge from LDC as the Boulder Lies
    and Truth Corpus (BLT-C). Challenges for both corpus creation and the deception
    detection include the fact that human performance on the task is typically at
    chance, that the signal is faint, that paid writers such as turkers are sometimes
    deceptive, and that deception is a complex human behavior; manifestations of deception
    depend on details of domain, intrinsic properties of the deceiver (such as education,
    linguistic competence, and the nature of the intention), and specifics of the
    deceptive act (e.g., lying vs. fabricating.) To overcome the inherent lack of
    ground truth, we have developed a set of semi-automatic techniques to ensure corpus
    validity. We present some preliminary results on the task of deception detection
    which suggest that the BLT-C is an improvement in the quality of resources available
    for this task.

  abstract: OpenSubtitles.org provides a large collection of user contributed subtitles
    in various languages for movies and TV programs. Subtitle translations are valuable
    resources for cross-lingual studies and machine translation research. A less explored
    feature of the collection is the inclusion of alternative translations, which
    can be very useful for training paraphrase systems or collecting multi-reference
    test suites for machine translation. However, differences in translation may also
    be due to misspellings, incomplete or corrupt data files, or wrongly aligned subtitles.
    This paper reports our efforts in recognising and classifying alternative subtitle
    translations with language independent techniques. We use time-based alignment
    with lexical re-synchronisation techniques and BLEU score filters and sort alternative
    translations into categories using edit distance metrics and heuristic rules.
    Our approach produces large numbers of sentence-aligned translation alternatives
    for over 50 languages provided via the OPUS corpus collection.

  abstract: This article describes a large comparable corpus for Basque and Spanish
    and the methods employed to build a parallel resource from the original data.
    The EITB corpus, a strongly comparable corpus in the news domain, is to be shared
    with the research community, as an aid for the development and testing of methods
    in comparable corpora exploitation, and as basis for the improvement of data-driven
    machine translation systems for this language pair. Competing approaches were
    explored for the alignment of comparable segments in the corpus, resulting in
    the design of a simple method which outperformed a state-of-the-art method on
    the corpus test sets. The method we present is highly portable, computationally
    efficient, and significantly reduces deployment work, a welcome result for the
    exploitation of comparable corpora.

  abstract: This paper describes the creation process and statistics of the official
    United Nations Parallel Corpus, the first parallel corpus composed from United
    Nations documents published by the original data creator. The parallel corpus
    presented consists of manually translated UN documents from the last 25 years
    (1990 to 2014) for the six official UN languages, Arabic, Chinese, English, French,
    Russian, and Spanish. The corpus is freely available for download under a liberal
    license. Apart from the pairwise aligned documents, a fully aligned subcorpus
    for the six official UN languages is distributed. We provide baseline BLEU scores

  abstract: "This paper presents WAGS (Word Alignment Gold Standard), a novel benchmark\
    \ which allows extensive evaluation of WA tools on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and\
    \ rare words. WAGS is a subset of the Common Test section of the Europarl English-Italian\
    \ parallel corpus, and is specifically tailored to OOV and rare words. WAGS is\
    \ composed of 6,715 sentence pairs containing 11,958 occurrences of OOV and rare\
    \ words up to frequency 15 in the Europarl Training set (5,080 English words and\
    \ 6,878 Italian words), representing almost 3% of the whole text. Since WAGS is\
    \ focused on OOV/rare words, manual alignments are provided for these words only,\
    \ and not for the whole sentences. Two off-the-shelf word aligners have been evaluated\
    \ on WAGS, and results have been compared to those obtained on an existing benchmark\
    \ tailored to full text alignment. The results obtained confirm that WAGS is a\
    \ valuable resource, which allows a statistically sound evaluation of WA systems\u2019\
    \ performance on OOV and rare words, as well as extensive data analyses. WAGS\

  abstract: Paraphrasing of reference translations has been shown to improve the correlation
    with human judgements in automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) outputs.
    In this work, we present a new dataset for evaluating English-Czech translation
    based on automatic paraphrases. We compare this dataset with an existing set of
    manually created paraphrases and find that even automatic paraphrases can improve
    MT evaluation. We have also propose and evaluate several criteria for selecting
    suitable reference translations from a larger set.

  abstract: We present Poly-GrETEL, an online tool which enables syntactic querying
    in parallel treebanks, based on the monolingual GrETEL environment. We provide
    online access to the Europarl parallel treebank for Dutch and English, allowing
    users to query the treebank using either an XPath expression or an example sentence
    in order to look for similar constructions. We provide automatic alignments between
    the nodes. By combining example-based query functionality with node alignments,
    we limit the need for users to be familiar with the query language and the structure
    of the trees in the source and target language, thus facilitating the use of parallel
    corpora for comparative linguistics and translation studies.

  abstract: 'We present NorGramBank, a treebank for Norwegian with highly detailed
    LFG analyses. It is one of many treebanks made available through the INESS treebanking
    infrastructure. NorGramBank was constructed as a parsebank, i.e. by automatically
    parsing a corpus, using the wide coverage grammar NorGram. One part consisting
    of 350,000 words has been manually disambiguated using computer-generated discriminants.
    A larger part of 50 M words has been stochastically disambiguated. The treebank
    is dynamic: by global reparsing at certain intervals it is kept compatible with
    the latest versions of the grammar and the lexicon, which are continually further
    developed in interaction with the annotators. A powerful query language, INESS
    Search, has been developed for search across formalisms in the INESS treebanks,
    including LFG c- and f-structures. Evaluation shows that the grammar provides
    about 85% of randomly selected sentences with good analyses. Agreement among the
    annotators responsible for manual disambiguation is satisfactory, but also suggests
    desirable simplifications of the grammar.'

  abstract: Parsing predicate-argument structures in a deep syntax framework requires
    graphs to be predicted. Argument structures represent a higher level of abstraction
    than the syntactic ones and are thus more difficult to predict even for highly
    accurate parsing models on surfacic syntax. In this paper we investigate deep
    syntax parsing, using a French data set (Ribeyre et al., 2014a). We demonstrate
    that the use of topologically different types of syntactic features, such as dependencies,
    tree fragments, spines or syntactic paths, brings a much needed context to the
    parser. Our higher-order parsing model, gaining thus up to 4 points, establishes
    the state of the art for parsing French deep syntactic structures.

  abstract: 'Idafa in traditional Arabic grammar is an umbrella construction that
    covers several phenomena including what is expressed in English as noun-noun compounds
    and Saxon and Norman genitives. Additionally, Idafa participates in some other
    constructions, such as quantifiers, quasi-prepositions, and adjectives. Identifying
    the various types of the Idafa construction (IC) is of importance to Natural Language
    processing (NLP) applications. Noun-Noun compounds exhibit special behavior in
    most languages impacting their semantic interpretation. Hence distinguishing them
    could have an impact on downstream NLP applications. The most comprehensive syntactic
    representation of the Arabic language is the LDC Arabic Treebank (ATB). In the
    ATB, ICs are not explicitly labeled and furthermore, there is no distinction between
    ICs of noun-noun relations and other traditional ICs. Hence, we devise a detailed
    syntactic and semantic typification process of the IC phenomenon in Arabic. We
    target the ATB as a platform for this classification. We render the ATB annotated
    with explicit IC labels but with the further semantic characterization which is
    useful for syntactic, semantic and cross language processing. Our typification
    of IC comprises 3 main syntactic IC types: FIC, GIC, and TIC, and they are further
    divided into 10 syntactic subclasses. The TIC group is further classified into
    semantic relations. We devise a method for automatic IC labeling and compare its
    yield against the CATiB treebank. Our evaluation shows that we achieve the same
    level of accuracy, but with the additional fine-grained classification into the
    various syntactic and semantic types.'

  abstract: 'The specialised lexicon belongs to the most prominent attributes of specialised
    writing: Terms function as semantically dense encodings of specialised concepts,
    which, in the absence of terms, would require lengthy explanations and descriptions.
    In this paper, we argue that terms are the result of diachronic processes on both
    the semantic and the morpho-syntactic level. Very little is known about these
    processes. We therefore present a corpus annotation project aiming at revealing
    how terms are coined and how they evolve to fit their function as semantically
    and morpho-syntactically dense encodings of specialised knowledge. The scope of
    this paper is two-fold: Firstly, we outline our methodology for annotating terminology
    in a diachronic corpus of scientific publications. Moreover, we provide a detailed
    analysis of our annotation results and suggest methods for improving the accuracy
    of annotations in a setting as difficult as ours. Secondly, we present results
    of a pilot study based on the annotated terms. The results suggest that terms
    in older texts are linguistically relatively simple units that are hard to distinguish
    from the lexicon of general language. We believe that this supports our hypothesis
    that terminology undergoes diachronic processes of densification and specialisation.'

    page layout structure into two columns from layout damaged digitized files. We
    designed several CRF-based approaches, either to identify column separator or
    to classify each token from each line into left or right columns. We achieved
    our best results with a model trained on homogeneous corpora (only files composed
    of 2 columns) when classifying each token into left or right columns (overall
    F-measure of 0.968). Our experiments show it is possible to recover the original
    layout in columns of digitized documents with results of quality.

    \ a child literature corpus (CLC) including 535 books written for 3-12 years old\
    \ children, and a corpus of transcribed children\u2019s speech (CSC) at ages 1;4-4;8.\
    \ A comparison between the word frequencies of CLC and CSC gave positive correlation\
    \ results, suggesting the usability of the CLC to extract AoA information. We\
    \ assumed that frequent words of the CLC would correspond to early acquired words\
    \ whereas frequent words of a corpus of adult language would correspond to late\
    \ acquired words. To validate AoA results from our corpus-based approach, a rated\
    \ AoA questionnaire was conducted on adults. Imageability values were collected\
    \ via a different questionnaire conducted on adults. We conclude that it is possible\
    \ to deduce AoA information for high frequency words with the corpus-based approach.\
    \ The results about low frequency words were inconclusive, which is attributed\
    \ to the fact that corpus-based AoA information is affected by the strong negative\
    \ correlation between corpus frequency and rated AoA."

  abstract: This work presents a straightforward method for extending or creating
    in-domain web corpora by focused webcrawling. The focused webcrawler uses statistical
    N-gram language models to estimate the relatedness of documents and weblinks and
    needs as input only N-grams or plain texts of a predefined domain and seed URLs
    as starting points. Two experiments demonstrate that our focused crawler is able
    to stay focused in domain and language. The first experiment shows that the crawler
    stays in a focused domain, the second experiment demonstrates that language models
    trained on focused crawls obtain better perplexity scores on in-domain corpora.
    We distribute the focused crawler as open source software.

  abstract: 'In computer-mediated communication, Latin-based scripts users often omit
    diacritics when writing. Such text is typically easily understandable to humans
    but very difficult for computational processing because many words become ambiguous
    or unknown. Letter-level approaches to diacritic restoration generalise better
    and do not require a lot of training data but word-level approaches tend to yield
    better results. However, they typically rely on a lexicon which is an expensive
    resource, not covering non-standard forms, and often not available for less-resourced
    languages. In this paper we present diacritic restoration models that are trained
    on easy-to-acquire corpora. We test three different types of corpora (Wikipedia,
    general web, Twitter) for three South Slavic languages (Croatian, Serbian and
    Slovene) and evaluate them on two types of text: standard (Wikipedia) and non-standard
    (Twitter). The proposed approach considerably outperforms charlifter, so far the
    only open source tool available for this task. We make the best performing systems
    freely available.'

  abstract: As data-driven approaches started to make their way into the Natural Language
    Generation (NLG) domain, the need for automation of corpus building and extension
    became apparent. Corpus creation and extension in data-driven NLG domain traditionally
    involved manual paraphrasing performed by either a group of experts or with resort
    to crowd-sourcing. Building the training corpora manually is a costly enterprise
    which requires a lot of time and human resources. We propose to automate the process
    of corpus extension by integrating automatically obtained synonyms and paraphrases.
    Our methodology allowed us to significantly increase the size of the training
    corpus and its level of variability (the number of distinct tokens and specific
    syntactic structures). Our extension solutions are fully automatic and require
    only some initial validation. The human evaluation results confirm that in many
    cases native speakers favor the outputs of the model built on the extended corpus.

    effort to create a large scale manually diacritized corpus for various Arabic
    text genres. The target size of the annotated corpus is 2 million words. We summarize
    the guidelines and describe issues encountered during the training of the annotators.
    We also discuss the challenges posed by the complexity of the Arabic language
    and how they are addressed. Finally, we present the diacritization annotation
    procedure and detail the quality of the resulting annotations.

  abstract: The goal of the cognitive machine translation (MT) evaluation approach
    is to build classifiers which assign post-editing effort scores to new texts.
    The approach helps estimate fair compensation for post-editors in the translation
    industry by evaluating the cognitive difficulty of post-editing MT output. The
    approach counts the number of errors classified in different categories on the
    basis of how much cognitive effort they require in order to be corrected. In this
    paper, we present the results of applying an existing cognitive evaluation approach
    to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We provide a comparison of the number of errors
    and categories of errors in three MSA texts of different MT quality (without any
    language-specific adaptation), as well as a comparison between MSA texts and texts
    from three Indo-European languages (Russian, Spanish, and Bulgarian), taken from
    a previous experiment. The results show how the error distributions change passing
    from the MSA texts of worse MT quality to MSA texts of better MT quality, as well
    as a similarity in distinguishing the texts of better MT quality for all four
    languages.

  abstract: Effectively assessing Natural Language Processing output tasks is a challenge
    for research in the area. In the case of Machine Translation (MT), automatic metrics
    are usually preferred over human evaluation, given time and budget constraints.However,
    traditional automatic metrics (such as BLEU) are not reliable for absolute quality
    assessment of documents, often producing similar scores for documents translated
    by the same MT system.For scenarios where absolute labels are necessary for building
    models, such as document-level Quality Estimation, these metrics can not be fully
    trusted. In this paper, we introduce a corpus of reading comprehension tests based
    on machine translated documents, where we evaluate documents based on answers
    to questions by fluent speakers of the target language. We describe the process
    of creating such a resource, the experiment design and agreement between the test
    takers. Finally, we discuss ways to convert the reading comprehension test into
    document-level quality scores.

  abstract: 'Resources such as WordNet are useful for NLP applications, but their
    manual construction consumes time and personnel, and frequently results in low
    coverage. One alternative is the automatic construction of large resources from
    corpora like distributional thesauri, containing semantically associated words.
    However, as they may contain noise, there is a strong need for automatic ways
    of evaluating the quality of the resulting resource. This paper introduces a gold
    standard that can aid in this task. The BabelNet-Based Semantic Gold Standard
    (B2SG) was automatically constructed based on BabelNet and partly evaluated by
    human judges. It consists of sets of tests that present one target word, one related
    word and three unrelated words. B2SG contains 2,875 validated relations: 800 for
    verbs and 2,075 for nouns; these relations are divided among synonymy, antonymy
    and hypernymy. They can be used as the basis for evaluating the accuracy of the
    similarity relations on distributional thesauri by comparing the proximity of
    the target word with the related and unrelated options and observing if the related
    word has the highest similarity value among them. As a case study two distributional
    thesauri were also developed: one using surface forms from a large (1.5 billion
    word) corpus and the other using lemmatized forms from a smaller (409 million
    word) corpus. Both distributional thesauri were then evaluated against B2SG, and
    the one using lemmatized forms performed slightly better.'

  abstract: In this paper we introduce MoBiL, a hybrid Monolingual, Bilingual and
    Language modelling feature set and feature selection and evaluation framework.
    The set includes translation quality indicators that can be utilized to automatically
    predict the quality of human translations in terms of content adequacy and language
    fluency. We compare MoBiL with the QuEst baseline set by using them in classifiers
    trained with support vector machine and relevance vector machine learning algorithms
    on the same data set. We also report an experiment on feature selection to opt
    for fewer but more informative features from MoBiL. Our experiments show that
    classifiers trained on our feature set perform consistently better in predicting
    both adequacy and fluency than the classifiers trained on the baseline feature
    set. MoBiL also performs well when used with both support vector machine and relevance
    vector machine algorithms.

    \ few popular approaches to the evaluation of ranking. When dealing with problems\

    \ various problems, including the inability to deal with elements of the same\
    \ rank, inconsistent and ambiguous lower bound scores, and an inappropriate cost\

    \ named rankDCG, that addresses these problems. We provide a number of criteria\
    \ for any effective ranking algorithm and show that only rankDCG satisfies them\
    \ all. Results are presented on constructed and real data sets. We release a publicly\

  abstract: Contents analisys from text data requires semantic representations that
    are difficult to obtain automatically, as they may require large handcrafted knowledge
    bases or manually annotated examples. Unsupervised autonomous methods for generating
    semantic representations are of greatest interest in face of huge volumes of text
    to be exploited in all kinds of applications. In this work we describe the generation
    and validation of semantic representations in the vector space paradigm for Spanish.
    The method used is GloVe (Pennington, 2014), one of the best performing reported
    methods , and vectors were trained over Spanish Wikipedia. The learned vectors
    evaluation is done in terms of word analogy and similarity tasks (Pennington,
    2014; Baroni, 2014; Mikolov, 2013a). The vector set and a Spanish version for
    some widely used semantic relatedness tests are made publicly available.

  abstract: Preprocessing is a preliminary step in many fields including IR and NLP.
    The effect of basic preprocessing settings on English for text summarization is
    well-studied. However, there is no such effort found for the Urdu language (with
    the best of our knowledge). In this study, we analyze the effect of basic preprocessing
    settings for single-document text summarization for Urdu, on a benchmark corpus
    using various experiments. The analysis is performed using the state-of-the-art
    algorithms for extractive summarization and the effect of stopword removal, lemmatization,
    and stemming is analyzed. Results showed that these pre-processing settings improve
    the results.

  abstract: This paper describes the process of creating a corpus annotated for concepts
    and semantic relations in the scientific domain. A part of the ACL Anthology Corpus
    was selected for annotation, but the annotation process itself is not specific
    to the computational linguistics domain and could be applied to any scientific
    corpora. Concepts were identified and annotated fully automatically, based on
    a combination of terminology extraction and available ontological resources. A
    typology of semantic relations between concepts is also proposed. This typology,
    consisting of 18 domain-specific and 3 generic relations, is the result of a corpus-based
    investigation of the text sequences occurring between concepts in sentences. A
    sample of 500 abstracts from the corpus is currently being manually annotated
    with these semantic relations. Only explicit relations are taken into account,
    so that the data could serve to train or evaluate pattern-based semantic relation
    classification systems.

  abstract: GATE is a widely used open-source solution for text processing with a
    large user community. It contains components for several natural language processing
    tasks. However, temporal information extraction functionality within GATE has
    been rather limited so far, despite being a prerequisite for many application
    scenarios in the areas of natural language processing and information retrieval.
    This paper presents an integrated approach to temporal information processing.
    We take state-of-the-art tools in temporal expression and event recognition and
    bring them together to form an openly-available resource within the GATE infrastructure.
    GATE-Time provides annotation in the form of TimeML events and temporal expressions
    complying with this mature ISO standard for temporal semantic annotation of documents.
    Major advantages of GATE-Time are (i) that it relies on HeidelTime for temporal
    tagging, so that temporal expressions can be extracted and normalized in multiple
    languages and across different domains, (ii) it includes a modern, fast event
    recognition and classification tool, and (iii) that it can be combined with different
    linguistic pre-processing annotations, and is thus not bound to license restricted
    preprocessing components.

  abstract: Distributional thesauri are useful in many tasks of Natural Language Processing.
    In this paper, we address the problem of building and evaluating such thesauri
    with the help of Information Retrieval (IR) concepts. Two main contributions are
    proposed. First, following the work of [8], we show how IR tools and concepts
    can be used with success to build a thesaurus. Through several experiments and
    by evaluating directly the results with reference lexicons, we show that some
    IR models outperform state-of-the-art systems. Secondly, we use IR as an applicative
    framework to indirectly evaluate the generated thesaurus. Here again, this task-based
    evaluation validates the IR approach used to build the thesaurus. Moreover, it
    allows us to compare these results with those from the direct evaluation framework
    used in the literature. The observed differences bring these evaluation habits
    into question.

  abstract: We present the first version of a corpus annotated for psychiatric disorders
    and their etiological factors. The paper describes the choice of text, annotated
    entities and events/relations as well as the annotation scheme and procedure applied.
    The corpus is featuring a selection of focus psychiatric disorders including depressive
    disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic disorders and
    panic disorder. Etiological factors for these focus disorders are widespread and
    include genetic, physiological, sociological and environmental factors among others.
    Etiological events, including annotated evidence text, represent the interactions
    between their focus disorders and their etiological factors. Additionally to these
    core events, symptomatic and treatment events have been annotated. The current
    version of the corpus includes 175 scientific abstracts. All entities and events/relations
    have been manually annotated by domain experts and scores of inter-annotator agreement
    are presented. The aim of the corpus is to provide a first gold standard to support
    the development of biomedical text mining applications for the specific area of
    mental disorders which belong to the main contributors to the contemporary burden
    of disease.

  abstract: News sources frame issues in different ways in order to appeal or control
    the perception of their readers. We present a large scale study of news articles
    from partisan sources in the US across a variety of different issues. We first
    highlight that differences between sides exist by predicting the political leaning
    of articles of unseen political bias. Framing can be driven by different types
    of morality that each group values. We emphasize differences in framing of different
    news building on the moral foundations theory quantified using hand crafted lexicons.
    Our results show that partisan sources frame political issues differently both
    in terms of words usage and through the moral foundations they relate to.

  abstract: "Just as industrialization matured from mass production to customization\
    \ and personalization, so has the Web migrated from generic content to public\
    \ disclosures of one\u2019s most intimately held thoughts, opinions and beliefs.\
    \ This relatively new type of data is able to represent finer and more narrowly\
    \ defined demographic slices. If until now researchers have primarily focused\
    \ on leveraging personalized content to identify latent information such as gender,\
    \ nationality, location, or age of the author, this study seeks to establish a\
    \ structured way of extracting possessions, or items that people own or are entitled\
    \ to, as a way to ultimately provide insights into people\u2019s behaviors and\
    \ characteristics. In order to promote more research in this area, we are releasing\
    \ a set of 798 possessions extracted from blog genre, where possessions are marked\
    \ at different confidence levels, as well as a detailed set of guidelines to help\
    \ in future annotation studies."

  abstract: The DARPA BOLT Information Retrieval evaluations target open-domain natural-language
    queries over a large corpus of informal text in English, Chinese and Egyptian
    Arabic. We outline the goals of BOLT IR, comparing it with the prior GALE Distillation
    task. After discussing the properties of the BOLT IR corpus, we provide a detailed
    description of the query creation process, contrasting the summary query format
    presented to systems at run time with the full query format created by annotators.
    We describe the relevance criteria used to assess BOLT system responses, highlighting
    the evolution of the procedures used over the three evaluation phases. We provide
    a detailed review of the decision points model for relevance assessment introduced
    during Phase 2, and conclude with information about inter-assessor consistency
    achieved with the decision points assessment model.

  abstract: In this article, we present a method to validate a multi-lingual (English,
    Spanish, Russian, and Farsi) corpus on imageability ratings automatically expanded
    from MRCPD (Liu et al., 2014). We employed the corpus (Brysbaert et al., 2014)
    on concreteness ratings for our English MRCPD+ validation because of lacking human
    assessed imageability ratings and high correlation between concreteness ratings
    and imageability ratings (e.g. r = .83). For the same reason, we built a small
    corpus with human imageability assessment for the other language corpus validation.
    The results show that the automatically expanded imageability ratings are highly
    correlated with human assessment in all four languages, which demonstrate our
    automatic expansion method is valid and robust. We believe these new resources
    can be of significant interest to the research community, particularly in natural
    language processing and computational sociolinguistics.

    entries with information on the temporality of its word senses. Each synset of
    Hindi WordNet is automatically annotated to one of the five dimensions: past,
    present, future, neutral and atemporal. We use semi-supervised learning strategy
    to build temporal classifiers over the glosses of manually selected initial seed
    synsets. The classification process is iterated based on the repetitive confidence
    based expansion strategy of the initial seed list until cross-validation accuracy
    drops. The resource is unique in its nature as, to the best of our knowledge,
    still no such resource is available for Hindi.'

  abstract: Our work addresses automatic detection of enunciations and segments with
    reformulations in French spoken corpora. The proposed approach is syntagmatic.
    It is based on reformulation markers and specificities of spoken language. The
    reference data are built manually and have gone through consensus. Automatic methods,
    based on rules and CRF machine learning, are proposed in order to detect the enunciations
    and segments that contain reformulations. With the CRF models, different features
    are exploited within a window of various sizes. Detection of enunciations with
    reformulations shows up to 0.66 precision. The tests performed for the detection
    of reformulated segments indicate that the task remains difficult. The best average
    performance values reach up to 0.65 F-measure, 0.75 precision, and 0.63 recall.
    We have several perspectives to this work for improving the detection of reformulated
    segments and for studying the data from other points of view.

  abstract: Negation is often found more frequent in dialogue than commonly written
    texts, such as literary texts. Furthermore, the scope and focus of negation depends
    on context in dialogues than other forms of texts. Existing negation datasets
    have focused on non-dialogue texts such as literary texts where the scope and
    focus of negation is normally present within the same sentence where the negation
    is located and therefore are not the most appropriate to inform the development
    of negation handling algorithms for dialogue-based systems. In this paper, we
    present DT -Neg corpus (DeepTutor Negation corpus) which contains texts extracted
    from tutorial dialogues where students interacted with an Intelligent Tutoring
    System (ITS) to solve conceptual physics problems. The DT -Neg corpus contains
    annotated negations in student responses with scope and focus marked based on
    the context of the dialogue. Our dataset contains 1,088 instances and is available
    for research purposes at http://language.memphis.edu/dt-neg.

  abstract: This paper discusses the creation of a semantically annotated corpus of
    questions about patient data in electronic health records (EHRs). The goal is
    provide the training data necessary for semantic parsers to automatically convert
    EHR questions into a structured query. A layered annotation strategy is used which
    mirrors a typical natural language processing (NLP) pipeline. First, questions
    are syntactically analyzed to identify multi-part questions. Second, medical concepts
    are recognized and normalized to a clinical ontology. Finally, logical forms are
    created using a lambda calculus representation. We use a corpus of 446 questions
    asking for patient-specific information. From these, 468 specific questions are
    found containing 259 unique medical concepts and requiring 53 unique predicates
    to represent the logical forms. We further present detailed characteristics of
    the corpus, including inter-annotator agreement results, and describe the challenges
    automatic NLP systems will face on this task.

    \ such as \u201Cthree days ago\u201D, to computer-readable forms, such as 2016-03-07.\
    \ The annotation scheme addresses several weaknesses of the existing TimeML standard,\
    \ allowing the representation of time expressions that align to more than one\
    \ calendar unit (e.g., \u201Cthe past three summers\u201D), that are defined relative\

    \ or intersections of smaller time expressions (e.g., \u201CTuesdays and Thursdays\u201D\
    ). It achieves this by modeling time expression interpretation as the semantic\
    \ composition of temporal operators like UNION, NEXT, and AFTER. We have applied\
    \ the annotation scheme to 34 documents so far, producing 1104 annotations, and\

  abstract: Proverbs are commonly metaphoric in nature and the mapping across domains
    is commonly established in proverbs. The abundance of proverbs in terms of metaphors
    makes them an extremely valuable linguistic resource since they can be utilized
    as a gold standard for various metaphor related linguistic tasks such as metaphor
    identification or interpretation. Besides, a collection of proverbs fromvarious
    languages annotated with metaphors would also be essential for social scientists
    to explore the cultural differences betweenthose languages. In this paper, we
    introduce PROMETHEUS, a dataset consisting of English proverbs and their equivalents
    in Italian.In addition to the word-level metaphor annotations for each proverb,
    PROMETHEUS contains other types of information such as the metaphoricity degree
    of the overall proverb, its meaning, the century that it was first recorded in
    and a pair of subjective questions responded by the annotators. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first multi-lingual and open-domain corpus of proverbs
    annotated with word-level metaphors.

  abstract: "This paper reports on the development of a French FrameNet, within the\
    \ ASFALDA project. While the first phase of the project focused on the development\
    \ of a French set of frames and corresponding lexicon (Candito et al., 2014),\
    \ this paper concentrates on the subsequent corpus annotation phase, which focused\
    \ on four notional domains (commercial transactions, cognitive stances, causality\
    \ and verbal communication). Given full coverage is not reachable for a relatively\
    \ \u201Cnew\u201D FrameNet project, we advocate that focusing on specific notional\
    \ domains allowed us to obtain full lexical coverage for the frames of these domains,\
    \ while partially reflecting word sense ambiguities. Furthermore, as frames and\
    \ roles were annotated on two French Treebanks (the French Treebank (Abeill\xE9\
    \ and Barrier, 2004) and the Sequoia Treebank (Candito and Seddah, 2012), we were\
    \ able to extract a syntactico-semantic lexicon from the annotated frames. In\
    \ the resource\u2019s current status, there are 98 frames, 662 frame evoking words,\
    \ 872 senses, and about 13000 annotated frames, with their semantic roles assigned\
    \ to portions of text. The French FrameNet is freely available at alpage.inria.fr/asfalda."

  abstract: 'This paper reports a critical analysis of the ISO TimeML standard, in
    the light of several experiences of temporal annotation that were conducted on
    spoken French. It shows that the norm suffers from weaknesses that should be corrected
    to fit a larger variety of needs inNLP and in corpus linguistics. We present our
    proposition of some improvements of the norm before it will be revised by the
    ISO Committee in 2017. These modifications concern mainly (1) Enrichments of well
    identified features of the norm: temporal function of TIMEX time expressions,
    additional types for TLINK temporal relations; (2) Deeper modifications concerning
    the units or features annotated: clarification between time and tense for EVENT
    units, coherence of representation between temporal signals (the SIGNAL unit)
    and TIMEX modifiers (the MOD feature); (3) A recommendation to perform temporal
    annotation on top of a syntactic (rather than lexical) layer (temporal annotation
    on a treebank).'

  abstract: We present here a general set of semantic frames to annotate causal expressions,
    with a rich lexicon in French and an annotated corpus of about 5000 instances
    of causal lexical items with their corresponding semantic frames. The aim of our
    project is to have both the largest possible coverage of causal phenomena in French,
    across all parts of speech, and have it linked to a general semantic framework
    such as FN, to benefit in particular from the relations between other semantic
    frames, e.g., temporal ones or intentional ones, and the underlying upper lexical
    ontology that enable some forms of reasoning. This is part of the larger ASFALDA
    French FrameNet project, which focuses on a few different notional domains which
    are interesting in their own right (Djemma et al., 2016), including cognitive
    positions and communication frames. In the process of building the French lexicon
    and preparing the annotation of the corpus, we had to remodel some of the frames
    proposed in FN based on English data, with hopefully more precise frame definitions
    to facilitate human annotation. This includes semantic clarifications of frames
    and frame elements, redundancy elimination, and added coverage. The result is
    arguably a significant improvement of the treatment of causality in FN itself.

  abstract: This paper presents a two-step methodology to annotate spatial knowledge
    on top of OntoNotes semantic roles. First, we manipulate semantic roles to automatically
    generate potential additional spatial knowledge. Second, we crowdsource annotations
    with Amazon Mechanical Turk to either validate or discard the potential additional
    spatial knowledge. The resulting annotations indicate whether entities are or
    are not located somewhere with a degree of certainty, and temporally anchor this
    spatial information. Crowdsourcing experiments show that the additional spatial
    knowledge is ubiquitous and intuitive to humans, and experimental results show
    that it can be inferred automatically using standard supervised machine learning
    techniques.

  abstract: This article describes SPACEREF, a corpus of street-level geographic descriptions.
    Pedestrians are walking a route in a (real) urban environment, describing their
    actions. Their position is automatically logged, their speech is manually transcribed,
    and their references to objects are manually annotated with respect to a crowdsourced
    geographic database. We describe how the data was collected and annotated, and
    how it has been used in the context of creating resources for an automatic pedestrian
    navigation system.

  abstract: This paper describes the procedure of semantic role labeling and the development
    of the first manually annotated Persian Proposition Bank (PerPB) which added a
    layer of predicate-argument information to the syntactic structures of Persian
    Dependency Treebank (known as PerDT). Through the process of annotating, the annotators
    could see the syntactic information of all the sentences and so they annotated
    29982 sentences with more than 9200 unique verbs. In the annotation procedure,
    the direct syntactic dependents of the verbs were the first candidates for being
    annotated. So we did not annotate the other indirect dependents unless their phrasal
    heads were propositional and had their own arguments or adjuncts. Hence besides
    the semantic role labeling of verbs, the argument structure of 1300 unique propositional
    nouns and 300 unique propositional adjectives were annotated in the sentences,
    too. The accuracy of annotation process was measured by double annotation of the
    data at two separate stages and finally the data was prepared in the CoNLL dependency
    format.

  abstract: We describe our ongoing effort to establish an annotation scheme for describing
    the semantic structures of research articles in the computer science domain, with
    the intended use of developing search systems that can refine their results by
    the roles of the entities denoted by the query keys. In our scheme, mentions of
    entities are annotated with ontology-based types, and the roles of the entities
    are annotated as relations with other entities described in the text. So far,
    we have annotated 400 abstracts from the ACL anthology and the ACM digital library.
    In this paper, the scheme and the annotated dataset are described, along with
    the problems found in the course of annotation. We also show the results of automatic
    annotation and evaluate the corpus in a practical setting in application to topic
    extraction.

  abstract: "We propose a way of enriching the TimeML annotations of TimeBank by adding\
    \ information about the Topic Time in terms of Klein (1994). The annotations are\
    \ partly automatic, partly inferential and partly manual. The corpus was converted\
    \ into the native format of the annotation software GraphAnno and POS-tagged using\
    \ the Stanford bidirectional dependency network tagger. On top of each finite\
    \ verb, a FIN-node with tense information was created, and on top of any FIN-node,\
    \ a TOPICTIME-node, in accordance with Klein\u2019s (1994) treatment of finiteness\
    \ as the linguistic correlate of the Topic Time. Each TOPICTIME-node is linked\
    \ to a MAKEINSTANCE-node representing an (instantiated) event in TimeML (Pustejovsky\
    \ et al. 2005), the markup language used for the annotation of TimeBank. For such\
    \ links we introduce a new category, ELINK. ELINKs capture the relationship between\
    \ the Topic Time (TT) and the Time of Situation (TSit) and have an aspectual interpretation\
    \ in Klein\u2019s (1994) theory. In addition to these automatic and inferential\
    \ annotations, some TLINKs were added manually. Using an example from the corpus,\
    \ we show that the inclusion of the Topic Time in the annotations allows for a\
    \ richer representation of the temporal structure than does TimeML. A way of representing\
    \ this structure in a diagrammatic form similar to the T-Box format (Verhagen,\
    \ 2007) is proposed."

  abstract: Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words missed by Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech
    Recognition (LVCSR) systems can be recovered with the help of topic and semantic
    context of the OOV words captured from a diachronic text corpus. In this paper
    we investigate how the choice of documents for the diachronic text corpora affects
    the retrieval of OOV Proper Names (PNs) relevant to an audio document. We first
    present our diachronic French broadcast news datasets, which highlight the motivation
    of our study on OOV PNs. Then the effect of using diachronic text data from different
    sources and a different time span is analysed. With OOV PN retrieval experiments
    on French broadcast news videos, we conclude that a diachronic corpus with text
    from different sources leads to better retrieval performance than one relying
    on text from single source or from a longer time span.

  abstract: This paper reports our work on building up a Cantonese Speech-to-Text
    (STT) system with a syllable based acoustic model. This is a part of an effort
    in building a STT system to aid dyslexic students who have cognitive deficiency
    in writing skills but have no problem expressing their ideas through speech. For
    Cantonese speech recognition, the basic unit of acoustic models can either be
    the conventional Initial-Final (IF) syllables, or the Onset-Nucleus-Coda (ONC)
    syllables where finals are further split into nucleus and coda to reflect the
    intra-syllable variations in Cantonese. By using the Kaldi toolkit, our system
    is trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimization model with the aid
    of GPUs for the hybrid Deep Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) with
    and without I-vector based speaker adaptive training technique. The input features
    of the same Gaussian Mixture Model with speaker adaptive training (GMM-SAT) to
    DNN are used in all cases. Experiments show that the ONC-based syllable acoustic
    modeling with I-vector based DNN-HMM achieves the best performance with the word
    error rate (WER) of 9.66% and the real time factor (RTF) of 1.38812.

  abstract: In this paper we present SCALE, a new Python toolkit that contains two
    extensions to n-gram language models. The first extension is a novel technique
    to model compound words called Semantic Head Mapping (SHM). The second extension,
    Bag-of-Words Language Modeling (BagLM), bundles popular models such as Latent
    Semantic Analysis and Continuous Skip-grams. Both extensions scale to large data
    and allow the integration into first-pass ASR decoding. The toolkit is open source,
    includes working examples and can be found on http://github.com/jorispelemans/scale.

  abstract: "Text-to-speech has long been centered on the production of an intelligible\
    \ message of good quality. More recently, interest has shifted to the generation\
    \ of more natural and expressive speech. A major issue of existing approaches\
    \ is that they usually rely on a manual annotation in expressive styles, which\
    \ tends to be rather subjective. A typical related issue is that the annotation\
    \ is strongly influenced \u2015 and possibly biased \u2015 by the semantic content\
    \ of the text (e.g. a shot or a fault may incite the annotator to tag that sequence\
    \ as expressing a high degree of excitation, independently of its acoustic realization).\
    \ This paper investigates the assumption that human annotation of basketball commentaries\
    \ in excitation levels can be automatically improved on the basis of acoustic\
    \ features. It presents two techniques for label correction exploiting a Gaussian\
    \ mixture and a proportional-odds logistic regression. The automatically re-annotated\
    \ corpus is then used to train HMM-based expressive speech synthesizers, the performance\
    \ of which is assessed through subjective evaluations. The results indicate that\
    \ the automatic correction of the annotation with Gaussian mixture helps to synthesize\
    \ more contrasted excitation levels, while preserving naturalness."

  abstract: In 2012 the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals started providing some
    of its tools from the field of spoken language in the form of Software as a Service
    (SaaS). This means users access the processing functionality over a web browser
    and therefore do not have to install complex software packages on a local computer.
    Amongst others, these tools include segmentation & labeling, grapheme-to-phoneme
    conversion, text alignment, syllabification and metadata generation, where all
    but the last are available for a variety of languages. Since its creation the
    number of available services and the web interface have changed considerably.
    We give an overview and a detailed description of the system architecture, the
    available web services and their functionality. Furthermore, we show how the number
    of files processed over the system developed in the last four years.

  abstract: 'This paper presents SPA, a web-based Speech Analytics platform that integrates
    several speech processing modules and that makes it possible to use them through
    the web. It was developed with the aim of facilitating the usage of the modules,
    without the need to know about software dependencies and specific configurations.
    Apart from being accessed by a web-browser, the platform also provides a REST
    API for easy integration with other applications. The platform is flexible, scalable,
    provides authentication for access restrictions, and was developed taking into
    consideration the time and effort of providing new services. The platform is still
    being improved, but it already integrates a considerable number of audio and text
    processing modules, including: Automatic transcription, speech disfluency classification,
    emotion detection, dialog act recognition, age and gender classification, non-nativeness
    detection, hyper-articulation detection, dialog act recognition, and two external
    modules for feature extraction and DTMF detection. This paper describes the SPA
    architecture, presents the already integrated modules, and provides a detailed
    description for the ones most recently integrated.'

  abstract: "The \u201CCorpus Oral Informatizado da Lingua Galega (CORILGA)\u201D\
    \ project aims at building a corpus of oral language for Galician, primarily designed\
    \ to study the linguistic variation and change. This project is currently under\
    \ development and it is periodically enriched with new contributions. The long-term\
    \ goal is that all the speech recordings will be enriched with phonetic, syllabic,\
    \ morphosyntactic, lexical and sentence ELAN-complaint annotations. A way to speed\
    \ up the process of annotation is to use automatic speech-recognition-based tools\
    \ tailored to the application. Therefore, CORILGA repository has been enhanced\
    \ with an automatic alignment tool, available to the administrator of the repository,\
    \ that aligns speech with an orthographic transcription. In the event that no\
    \ transcription, or just a partial one, were available, a speech recognizer for\
    \ Galician is used to generate word and phonetic segmentations. These recognized\
    \ outputs may contain errors that will have to be manually corrected by the administrator.\
    \ For assisting this task, the tool also provides an ELAN tier with the confidence\
    \ measure of each recognized word. In this paper, after the description of the\
    \ main facts of the CORILGA corpus, the speech alignment and recognition tools\
    \ are described. Both have been developed using the Kaldi toolkit."

  abstract: Governments are increasingly utilising online platforms in order to engage
    with, and ascertain the opinions of, their citizens. Whilst policy makers could
    potentially benefit from such enormous feedback from society, they first face
    the challenge of making sense out of the large volumes of data produced. This
    creates a demand for tools and technologies which will enable governments to quickly
    and thoroughly digest the points being made and to respond accordingly. By determining
    the argumentative and dialogical structures contained within a debate, we are
    able to determine the issues which are divisive and those which attract agreement.
    This paper proposes a method of graph-based analytics which uses properties of
    graphs representing networks of arguments pro- & con- in order to automatically
    analyse issues which divide citizens about new regulations. By future application
    of the most recent advances in argument mining, the results reported here will
    have a chance to scale up to enable sense-making of the vast amount of feedback
    received from citizens on directions that policy should take.

  abstract: "This paper describes metaTED \u2015 a freely available corpus of metadiscursive\
    \ acts in spoken language collected via crowdsourcing. Metadiscursive acts were\
    \ annotated on a set of 180 randomly chosen TED talks in English, spanning over\
    \ different speakers and topics. The taxonomy used for annotation is composed\
    \ of 16 categories, adapted from Adel(2010). This adaptation takes into account\
    \ both the material to annotate and the setting in which the annotation task is\
    \ performed. The crowdsourcing setup is described, including considerations regarding\
    \ training and quality control. The collected data is evaluated in terms of quantity\
    \ of occurrences, inter-annotator agreement, and annotation related measures (such\
    \ as average time on task and self-reported confidence). Results show different\
    \ levels of agreement among metadiscourse acts (\u03B1 \u2208 [0.15; 0.49]). To\
    \ further assess the collected material, a subset of the annotations was submitted\
    \ to expert appreciation, who validated which of the marked occurrences truly\
    \ correspond to instances of the metadiscursive act at hand. Similarly to what\
    \ happened with the crowd, experts revealed different levels of agreement between\
    \ categories (\u03B1 \u2208 [0.18; 0.72]). The paper concludes with a discussion\
    \ on the applicability of metaTED with respect to each of the 16 categories of\
    \ metadiscourse."

  abstract: 'Quotation and opinion extraction, discourse and factuality have all partly
    addressed the annotation and identification of Attribution Relations. However,
    disjoint efforts have provided a partial and partly inaccurate picture of attribution
    and generated small or incomplete resources, thus limiting the applicability of
    machine learning approaches. This paper presents PARC 3.0, a large corpus fully
    annotated with Attribution Relations (ARs). The annotation scheme was tested with
    an inter-annotator agreement study showing satisfactory results for the identification
    of ARs and high agreement on the selection of the text spans corresponding to
    its constitutive elements: source, cue and content. The corpus, which comprises
    around 20k ARs, was used to investigate the range of structures that can express
    attribution. The results show a complex and varied relation of which the literature
    has addressed only a portion. PARC 3.0 is available for research use and can be
    used in a range of different studies to analyse attribution and validate assumptions
    as well as to develop supervised attribution extraction models.'

  abstract: "We introduce improved guidelines for annotation of sentence specificity,\
    \ addressing the issues encountered in prior work. Our annotation provides judgements\
    \ of sentences in context. Rather than binary judgements, we introduce a specificity\
    \ scale which accommodates nuanced judgements. Our augmented annotation procedure\
    \ also allows us to define where in the discourse context the lack of specificity\
    \ can be resolved. In addition, the cause of the underspecification is annotated\
    \ in the form of free text questions. We present results from a pilot annotation\
    \ with this new scheme and demonstrate good inter-annotator agreement. We found\
    \ that the lack of specificity distributes evenly among immediate prior context,\
    \ long distance prior context and no prior context. We find that missing details\
    \ that are not resolved in the the prior context are more likely to trigger questions\
    \ about the reason behind events, \u201Cwhy\u201D and \u201Chow\u201D. Our data\

    \ the focus of an utterance, are precisely defined in theoretical linguistics\
    \ and potentially very useful in conceptual and practical terms, it has turned\
    \ out to be difficult to reliably annotate such notions in corpus data. We present\
    \ a large-scale focus annotation effort designed to overcome this problem. Our\
    \ annotation study is based on the tasked-based corpus CREG, which consists of\
    \ answers to explicitly given reading comprehension questions. We compare focus\
    \ annotation by trained annotators with a crowd-sourcing setup making use of untrained\
    \ native speakers. Given the task context and an annotation process incrementally\
    \ making the question form and answer type explicit, the trained annotators reach\
    \ substantial agreement for focus annotation. Interestingly, the crowd-sourcing\
    \ setup also supports high-quality annotation \u2015 for specific subtypes of\
    \ data. Finally, we turn to the question whether the relevance of focus annotation\
    \ can be extrinsically evaluated. We show that automatic short-answer assessment\
    \ significantly improves for focus annotated data. The focus annotated CREG corpus\

  abstract: Twitter-related studies often need to geo-locate Tweets or Twitter users,
    identifying their real-world geographic locations. As tweet-level geotagging remains
    rare, most prior work exploited tweet content, timezone and network information
    to inform geolocation, or else relied on off-the-shelf tools to geolocate users
    from location information in their user profiles. However, such user location
    metadata is not consistently structured, causing such tools to fail regularly,
    especially if a string contains multiple locations, or if locations are very fine-grained.
    We argue that user profile location (UPL) and tweet location need to be treated
    as distinct types of information from which differing inferences can be drawn.
    Here, we apply geoparsing to UPLs, and demonstrate how task performance can be
    improved by adapting our Edinburgh Geoparser, which was originally developed for
    processing English text. We present a detailed evaluation method and results,
    including inter-coder agreement. We demonstrate that the optimised geoparser can
    effectively extract and geo-reference multiple locations at different levels of
    granularity with an F1-score of around 0.90. We also illustrate how geoparsed
    UPLs can be exploited for international information trade studies and country-level
    sentiment analysis.

    \ Several techniques were employed to encourage high-quality annotations (for\
    \ example, providing clear and simple instructions) and to identify and discard\
    \ poor annotations (for example, using a small set of check questions annotated\

  abstract: In this paper, we present an experiment to detect emotions in tweets.
    Unlike much previous research, we draw the important distinction between the tasks
    of emotion detection in a closed world assumption (i.e. every tweet is emotional)
    and the complicated task of identifying emotional versus non-emotional tweets.
    Given an apparent lack of appropriately annotated data, we created two corpora
    for these tasks. We describe two systems, one symbolic and one based on machine
    learning, which we evaluated on our datasets. Our evaluation shows that a machine
    learning classifier performs best on emotion detection, while a symbolic approach
    is better for identifying relevant (i.e. emotional) tweets.

  abstract: "The increasing streams of information pose challenges to both humans\
    \ and machines. On the one hand, humans need to identify relevant information\
    \ and consume only the information that lies at their interests. On the other\
    \ hand, machines need to understand the information that is published in online\
    \ data streams and generate concise and meaningful overviews. We consider events\
    \ as prime factors to query for information and generate meaningful context. The\
    \ focus of this paper is to acquire empirical insights for identifying salience\
    \ features in tweets and news about a target event, i.e., the event of \u201C\
    whaling\u201D. We first derive a methodology to identify such features by building\
    \ up a knowledge space of the event enriched with relevant phrases, sentiments\
    \ and ranked by their novelty. We applied this methodology on tweets and we have\
    \ performed preliminary work towards adapting it to news articles. Our results\
    \ show that crowdsourcing text relevance, sentiments and novelty (1) can be a\
    \ main step in identifying salient information, and (2) provides a deeper and\
    \ more precise understanding of the data at hand compared to state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches."

  abstract: Emojis allow us to describe objects, situations and even feelings with
    small images, providing a visual and quick way to communicate. In this paper,
    we analyse emojis used in Twitter with distributional semantic models. We retrieve
    10 millions tweets posted by USA users, and we build several skip gram word embedding
    models by mapping in the same vectorial space both words and emojis. We test our
    models with semantic similarity experiments, comparing the output of our models
    with human assessment. We also carry out an exhaustive qualitative evaluation,
    showing interesting results.

  abstract: Despite the recent success of distributional semantic models (DSMs) in
    various semantic tasks they remain disconnected with real-world perceptual cues
    since they typically rely on linguistic features. Text data constitute the dominant
    source of features for the majority of such models, although there is evidence
    from cognitive science that cues from other modalities contribute to the acquisition
    and representation of semantic knowledge. In this work, we propose the crossmodal
    extension of a two-tier text-based model, where semantic representations are encoded
    in the first layer, while the second layer is used for computing similarity between
    words. We exploit text- and image-derived features for performing computations
    at each layer, as well as various approaches for their crossmodal fusion. It is
    shown that the crossmodal model performs better (from 0.68 to 0.71 correlation
    coefficient) than the unimodal one for the task of similarity computation between
    words.

  abstract: Recent efforts have focused on expanding the annotation coverage of PropBank
    from verb relations to adjective and noun relations, as well as light verb constructions
    (e.g., make an offer, take a bath). While each new relation type has presented
    unique annotation challenges, ensuring consistent and comprehensive annotation
    of light verb constructions has proved particularly challenging, given that light
    verb constructions are semi-productive, difficult to define, and there are often
    borderline cases. This research describes the iterative process of developing
    PropBank annotation guidelines for light verb constructions, the current guidelines,
    and a comparison to related resources.

    finding these inconsistencies and correcting them (even manually) can increase
    the quality of the data. Past research has focused mainly on detecting inconsistency
    in syntactic annotation. This work explores new approaches to detecting inconsistency
    in semantic annotation. Two ranking methods are presented in this paper: a discrepancy
    ranking and an entropy ranking. Those methods are then tested and evaluated on
    multiple corpora annotated with multiword expressions and supersense labels. The
    results show considerable improvements in detecting inconsistency candidates over
    a random baseline. Possible applications of methods for inconsistency detection
    are improving the annotation procedure as well as the guidelines and correcting

  abstract: We announce a new language resource for research on semantic parsing,
    a large, carefully curated collection of semantic dependency graphs representing
    multiple linguistic traditions. This resource is called SDP~2016 and provides
    an update and extension to previous versions used as Semantic Dependency Parsing
    target representations in the 2014 and 2015 Semantic Evaluation Exercises. For
    a common core of English text, this third edition comprises semantic dependency
    graphs from four distinct frameworks, packaged in a unified abstract format and
    aligned at the sentence and token levels. SDP 2016 is the first general release
    of this resource and available for licensing from the Linguistic Data Consortium
    in May 2016. The data is accompanied by an open-source SDP utility toolkit and
    system results from previous contrastive parsing evaluations against these target
    representations.

  abstract: 'Multi-pass sieve approaches have been successfully applied to entity
    coreference resolution and many other tasks in natural language processing (NLP),
    owing in part to the ease of designing high-precision rules for these tasks. However,
    the same is not true for event coreference resolution: typically lying towards
    the end of the standard information extraction pipeline, an event coreference
    resolver assumes as input the noisy outputs of its upstream components such as
    the trigger identification component and the entity coreference resolution component.
    The difficulty in designing high-precision rules makes it challenging to successfully
    apply a multi-pass sieve approach to event coreference resolution. In this paper,
    we investigate this challenge, proposing the first multi-pass sieve approach to
    event coreference resolution. When evaluated on the version of the KBP 2015 corpus
    available to the participants of EN Task 2 (Event Nugget Detection and Coreference),
    our approach achieves an Avg F-score of 40.32%, outperforming the best participating
    system by 0.67% in Avg F-score.'

  abstract: This project approaches the problem of language documentation and revitalization
    from a rather untraditional angle. To improve and facilitate language documentation
    of endangered languages, we attempt to use corpus linguistic methods and speech
    and language technologies to reduce the time needed for transcription and annotation
    of audio and video language recordings. The paper demonstrates this approach on
    the example of the endangered and seriously under-resourced variety of Eastern
    Chatino (CTP). We show how initial speech corpora can be created that can facilitate
    the development of speech and language technologies for under-resourced languages
    by utilizing Forced Alignment tools to time align transcriptions. Time-aligned
    transcriptions can be used to train speech corpora and utilize automatic speech
    recognition tools for the transcription and annotation of untranscribed data.
    Speech technologies can be used to reduce the time and effort necessary for transcription
    and annotation of large collections of audio and video recordings in digital language
    archives, addressing the transcription bottleneck problem that most language archives
    and many under-documented languages are confronted with. This approach can increase
    the availability of language resources from low-resourced and endangered languages
    to speech and language technology research and development.

  abstract: There exists a major incompatibility in emotion labeling framework among
    emotional speech corpora, that is, category-based and dimension-based. Commonizing
    these requires inter-corpus emotion labeling according to both frameworks, but
    doing this by human annotators is too costly for most cases. This paper examines
    the possibility of automatic cross-corpus emotion labeling. In order to evaluate
    the effectiveness of the automatic labeling, a comprehensive emotion annotation
    for two conversational corpora, UUDB and OGVC, was performed. With a state-of-the-art
    machine learning technique, dimensional and categorical emotion estimation models
    were trained and tested against the two corpora. For the emotion dimension estimation,
    the automatic cross-corpus emotion labeling for the different corpus was effective
    for the dimensions of aroused-sleepy, dominant-submissive and interested-indifferent,
    showing only slight performance degradation against the result for the same corpus.
    On the other hand, the performance for the emotion category estimation was not
    sufficient.

  abstract: Speech-enabled interfaces have the potential to become one of the most
    efficient and ergonomic environments for human-computer interaction and for text
    production. However, not much research has been carried out to investigate in
    detail the processes and strategies involved in the different modes of text production.
    This paper introduces and evaluates a corpus of more than 55 hours of English-to-Japanese
    user activity data that were collected within the ENJA15 project, in which translators
    were observed while writing and speaking translations (translation dictation)
    and during machine translation post-editing. The transcription of the spoken data,
    keyboard logging and eye-tracking data were recorded with Translog-II, post-processed
    and integrated into the CRITT Translation Process Research-DB (TPR-DB), which
    is publicly available under a creative commons license. The paper presents the
    ENJA15 data as part of a large multilingual Chinese, Danish, German, Hindi and
    Spanish translation process data collection of more than 760 translation sessions.
    It compares the ENJA15 data with the other language pairs and reviews some of
    its particularities.

  abstract: 'In the design of controlled experiments with language stimuli, researchers
    from psycholinguistic, neurolinguistic, and related fields, require language resources
    that isolate variables known to affect language processing. This article describes
    a freely available database that provides word level statistics for words and
    nonwords of Mandarin, Chinese. The featured lexical statistics include subtitle
    corpus frequency, phonological neighborhood density, neighborhood frequency, and
    homophone density. The accompanying word descriptors include pinyin, ascii phonetic
    transcription (sampa), lexical tone, syllable structure, dominant PoS, and syllable,
    segment and pinyin lengths for each phonological word. It is designed for researchers
    particularly concerned with language processing of isolated words and made to
    accommodate multiple existing hypotheses concerning the structure of the Mandarin
    syllable. The database is divided into multiple files according to the desired
    search criteria: 1) the syllable segmentation schema used to calculate density
    measures, and 2) whether the search is for words or nonwords. The database is
    open to the research community at https://github.com/karlneergaard/Mandarin-Neighborhood-Statistics.'

  abstract: TEITOK is a web-based framework for corpus creation, annotation, and distribution,
    that combines textual and linguistic annotation within a single TEI based XML
    document. TEITOK provides several built-in NLP tools to automatically (pre)process
    texts, and is highly customizable. It features multiple orthographic transcription
    layers, and a wide range of user-defined token-based annotations. For searching,
    TEITOK interfaces with a local CQP server. TEITOK can handle various types of
    additional resources including Facsimile images and linked audio files, making
    it possible to have a combined written/spoken corpus. It also has additional modules
    for PSDX syntactic annotation and several types of stand-off annotation.

  abstract: 'We present texigt, a command-line tool for the extraction of structured
    linguistic data from LaTeX source documents, and a language resource that has
    been generated using this tool: a corpus of interlinear glossed text (IGT) extracted
    from open access books published by Language Science Press. Extracted examples
    are represented in a simple XML format that is easy to process and can be used
    to validate certain aspects of interlinear glossed text. The main challenge involved
    is the parsing of TeX and LaTeX documents. We review why this task is impossible
    in general and how the texhs Haskell library uses a layered architecture and selective
    early evaluation (expansion) during lexing and parsing in order to provide access
    to structured representations of LaTeX documents at several levels. In particular,
    its parsing modules generate an abstract syntax tree for LaTeX documents after
    expansion of all user-defined macros and lexer-level commands that serves as an
    ideal interface for the extraction of interlinear glossed text by texigt. This
    architecture can easily be adapted to extract other types of linguistic data structures
    from LaTeX source documents.'

  abstract: Natural language processing applications are frequently integrated to
    solve complex linguistic problems, but the lack of interoperability between these
    tools tends to be one of the main issues found in that process. That is often
    caused by the different linguistic formats used across the applications, which
    leads to attempts to both establish standard formats to represent linguistic information
    and to create conversion tools to facilitate this integration. Pepper is an example
    of the latter, as a framework that helps the conversion between different linguistic
    annotation formats. In this paper, we describe the use of Pepper to convert a
    corpus linguistically annotated by the annotation scheme AWA into the relANNIS
    format, with the ultimate goal of interacting with AWA documents through the ANNIS
    interface. The experiment converted 40 megabytes of AWA documents, allowed their
    use on the ANNIS interface, and involved making architectural decisions during
    the mapping from AWA into relANNIS using Pepper. The main issues faced during
    this process were due to technical issues mainly caused by the integration of
    the different systems and projects, namely AWA, Pepper and ANNIS.

  abstract: Text preprocessing is an important and necessary task for all NLP applications.
    A simple variation in any preprocessing step may drastically affect the final
    results. Moreover replicability and comparability, as much as feasible, is one
    of the goals of our scientific enterprise, thus building systems that can ensure
    the consistency in our various pipelines would contribute significantly to our
    goals. The problem has become quite pronounced with the abundance of NLP tools
    becoming more and more available yet with different levels of specifications.
    In this paper, we present a dynamic unified preprocessing framework and tool,
    SPLIT, that is highly configurable based on user requirements which serves as
    a preprocessing tool for several tools at once. SPLIT aims to standardize the
    implementations of the most important preprocessing steps by allowing for a unified
    API that could be exchanged across different researchers to ensure complete transparency
    in replication. The user is able to select the required preprocessing tasks among
    a long list of preprocessing steps. The user is also able to specify the order
    of execution which in turn affects the final preprocessing output.

  abstract: Swiss dialects of German are, unlike most dialects of well standardised
    languages, widely used in everyday communication. Despite this fact, automatic
    processing of Swiss German is still a considerable challenge due to the fact that
    it is mostly a spoken variety rarely recorded and that it is subject to considerable
    regional variation. This paper presents a freely available general-purpose corpus
    of spoken Swiss German suitable for linguistic research, but also for training
    automatic tools. The corpus is a result of a long design process, intensive manual
    work and specially adapted computational processing. We first describe how the
    documents were transcribed, segmented and aligned with the sound source, and how
    inconsistent transcriptions were unified through an additional normalisation layer.
    We then present a bootstrapping approach to automatic normalisation using different
    machine-translation-inspired methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance
    of part-of-speech taggers on our data and show how the same bootstrapping approach
    improves part-of-speech tagging by 10% over four rounds. Finally, we present the
    modalities of access of the corpus as well as the data format.

  abstract: We present experiments on word segmentation for Akkadian cuneiform, an
    ancient writing system and a language used for about 3 millennia in the ancient
    Near East. To our best knowledge, this is the first study of this kind applied
    to either the Akkadian language or the cuneiform writing system. As a logosyllabic
    writing system, cuneiform structurally resembles Eastern Asian writing systems,
    so, we employ word segmentation algorithms originally developed for Chinese and
    Japanese. We describe results of rule-based algorithms, dictionary-based algorithms,
    statistical and machine learning approaches. Our results may indicate possible
    promising steps in cuneiform word segmentation that can create and improve natural
    language processing in this area.

  abstract: In this paper, we presented the annotation propagation tool we designed
    to be used in conjunction with the BRAT rapid annotation tool. We designed two
    experiments to annotate a corpus of 60 files, first not using our tool, second
    using our propagation tool. We evaluated the annotation time and the quality of
    annotations. We shown that using the annotation propagation tool reduces by 31.7%
    the time spent to annotate the corpus with a better quality of results.

  abstract: A potential work item (PWI) for ISO standard (MAP) about linguistic annotation
    concerning syntax-semantics mapping is discussed. MAP is a framework for graphical
    linguistic annotation to specify a mapping (set of combinations) between possible
    syntactic and semantic structures of the annotated linguistic data. Just like
    a UML diagram, a MAP diagram is formal, in the sense that it accurately specifies
    such a mapping. MAP provides a diagrammatic sort of concrete syntax for linguistic
    annotation far easier to understand than textual concrete syntax such as in XML,
    so that it could better facilitate collaborations among people involved in research,
    standardization, and practical use of linguistic data. MAP deals with syntactic
    structures including dependencies, coordinations, ellipses, transsentential constructions,
    and so on. Semantic structures treated by MAP are argument structures, scopes,
    coreferences, anaphora, discourse relations, dialogue acts, and so forth. In order
    to simplify explicit annotations, MAP allows partial descriptions, and assumes
    a few general rules on correspondence between syntactic and semantic compositions.

  abstract: When designing Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications that use
    Machine Learning (ML) techniques, feature extraction becomes a significant part
    of the development effort, whether developing a new application or attempting
    to reproduce results reported for existing NLP tasks. We present EDISON, a Java
    library of feature generation functions used in a suite of state-of-the-art NLP
    tools, based on a set of generic NLP data structures. These feature extractors
    populate simple data structures encoding the extracted features, which the package
    can also serialize to an intuitive JSON file format that can be easily mapped
    to formats used by ML packages. EDISON can also be used programmatically with
    JVM-based (Java/Scala) NLP software to provide the feature extractor input. The
    collection of feature extractors is organised hierarchically and a simple search
    interface is provided. In this paper we include examples that demonstrate the
    versatility and ease-of-use of the EDISON feature extraction suite to show that
    this can significantly reduce the time spent by developers on feature extraction
    design for NLP systems. The library is publicly hosted at https://github.com/IllinoisCogComp/illinois-cogcomp-nlp/,
    and we hope that other NLP researchers will contribute to the set of feature extractors.
    In this way, the community can help simplify reproduction of published results
    and the integration of ideas from diverse sources when developing new and improved
    NLP applications.

  abstract: This paper introduces MADAD, a general-purpose annotation tool for Arabic
    text with focus on readability annotation. This tool will help in overcoming the
    problem of lack of Arabic readability training data by providing an online environment
    to collect readability assessments on various kinds of corpora. Also the tool
    supports a broad range of annotation tasks for various linguistic and semantic
    phenomena by allowing users to create their customized annotation schemes. MADAD
    is a web-based tool, accessible through any web browser; the main features that
    distinguish MADAD are its flexibility, portability, customizability and its bilingual
    interface (Arabic/English).

  abstract: This paper presents a number of experiments to model changes in a historical
    Portuguese corpus composed of literary texts for the purpose of temporal text
    classification. Algorithms were trained to classify texts with respect to their
    publication date taking into account lexical variation represented as word n-grams,
    and morphosyntactic variation represented by part-of-speech (POS) distribution.
    We report results of 99.8% accuracy using word unigram features with a Support
    Vector Machines classifier to predict the publication date of documents in time
    intervals of both one century and half a century. A feature analysis is performed
    to investigate the most informative features for this task and how they are linked
    to language change.

    \ The task of automatic gender attribution has been considered in computational\
    \ linguistics as well. Most research of this type is done using (usually English)\
    \ texts with authorship metadata. In this paper, we propose a new method of male/female\
    \ corpus creation based on gender-specific first-person expressions. The method\
    \ was applied on CommonCrawl Web corpus for Polish (language, in which gender-revealing\
    \ first-person expressions are particularly frequent) to yield a large (780M words)\
    \ and varied collection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s texts. The whole procedure\
    \ for building the corpus and filtering out unwanted texts is described in the\
    \ present paper. The quality check was done on a random sample of the corpus to\
    \ make sure that the majority (84%) of texts are correctly attributed, natural\
    \ texts. Some preliminary (socio)linguistic insights (websites and words frequently\

  abstract: With the constant growth of the scientific literature, automated processes
    to enable access to its contents are increasingly in demand. Several functional
    discourse annotation schemes have been proposed to facilitate information extraction
    and summarisation from scientific articles, the most well known being argumentative
    zoning. Core Scientific concepts (CoreSC) is a three layered fine-grained annotation
    scheme providing content-based annotations at the sentence level and has been
    used to index, extract and summarise scientific publications in the biomedical
    literature. A previously developed CoreSC corpus on which existing automated tools
    have been trained contains a single annotation for each sentence. However, it
    is the case that more than one CoreSC concept can appear in the same sentence.
    Here, we present the Multi-CoreSC CRA corpus, a text corpus specific to the domain
    of cancer risk assessment (CRA), consisting of 50 full text papers, each of which
    contains sentences annotated with one or more CoreSCs. The full text papers have
    been annotated by three biology experts. We present several inter-annotator agreement
    measures appropriate for multi-label annotation assessment. Employing several
    inter-annotator agreement measures, we were able to identify the most reliable
    annotator and we built a harmonised consensus (gold standard) from the three different
    annotators, while also taking concept priority (as specified in the guidelines)
    into account. We also show that the new Multi-CoreSC CRA corpus allows us to improve
    performance in the recognition of CoreSCs. The updated guidelines, the multi-label
    CoreSC CRA corpus and other relevant, related materials are available at the time
    of publication at http://www.sapientaproject.com/.

  abstract: "The growth of social networking platforms has drawn a lot of attentions\
    \ to the need for social computing. Social computing utilises human insights for\
    \ computational tasks as well as design of systems that support social behaviours\
    \ and interactions. One of the key aspects of social computing is the ability\
    \ to attribute responsibility such as blame or praise to social events. This ability\
    \ helps an intelligent entity account and understand other intelligent entities\u2019\
    \ social behaviours, and enriches both the social functionalities and cognitive\
    \ aspects of intelligent agents. In this paper, we present an approach with a\
    \ model for blame and praise detection in text. We build our model based on various\
    \ theories of blame and include in our model features used by humans determining\
    \ judgment such as moral agent causality, foreknowledge, intentionality and coercion.\
    \ An annotated corpus has been created for the task of blame and praise detection\
    \ from text. The experimental results show that while our model gives similar\
    \ results compared to supervised classifiers on classifying text as blame, praise\
    \ or others, it outperforms supervised classifiers on more finer-grained classification\
    \ of determining the direction of blame and praise, i.e., self-blame, blame-others,\
    \ self-praise or praise-others, despite not using labelled training data."

  abstract: 'Word embeddings have recently seen a strong increase in interest as a
    result of strong performance gains on a variety of tasks. However, most of this
    research also underlined the importance of benchmark datasets, and the difficulty
    of constructing these for a variety of language-specific tasks. Still, many of
    the datasets used in these tasks could prove to be fruitful linguistic resources,
    allowing for unique observations into language use and variability. In this paper
    we demonstrate the performance of multiple types of embeddings, created with both
    count and prediction-based architectures on a variety of corpora, in two language-specific
    tasks: relation evaluation, and dialect identification. For the latter, we compare
    unsupervised methods with a traditional, hand-crafted dictionary. With this research,
    we provide the embeddings themselves, the relation evaluation task benchmark for
    use in further research, and demonstrate how the benchmarked embeddings prove
    a useful unsupervised linguistic resource, effectively used in a downstream task.'

  abstract: 'Wikipedia has become one of the most popular resources in natural language
    processing and it is used in quantities of applications. However, Wikipedia requires
    a substantial pre-processing step before it can be used. For instance, its set
    of nonstandardized annotations, referred to as the wiki markup, is language-dependent
    and needs specific parsers from language to language, for English, French, Italian,
    etc. In addition, the intricacies of the different Wikipedia resources: main article
    text, categories, wikidata, infoboxes, scattered into the article document or
    in different files make it difficult to have global view of this outstanding resource.
    In this paper, we describe WikiParq, a unified format based on the Parquet standard
    to tabulate and package the Wikipedia corpora. In combination with Spark, a map-reduce
    computing framework, and the SQL query language, WikiParq makes it much easier
    to write database queries to extract specific information or subcorpora from Wikipedia,
    such as all the first paragraphs of the articles in French, or all the articles
    on persons in Spanish, or all the articles on persons that have versions in French,
    English, and Spanish. WikiParq is available in six language versions and is potentially
    extendible to all the languages of Wikipedia. The WikiParq files are downloadable
    as tarball archives from this location: http://semantica.cs.lth.se/wikiparq/.'

  abstract: 'Code-switching texts are those that contain terms in two or more different
    languages, and they appear increasingly often in social media. The aim of this
    paper is to provide a resource to the research community to evaluate the performance
    of sentiment classification techniques on this complex multilingual environment,
    proposing an English-Spanish corpus of tweets with code-switching (EN-ES-CS CORPUS).
    The tweets are labeled according to two well-known criteria used for this purpose:
    SentiStrength and a trinary scale (positive, neutral and negative categories).
    Preliminary work on the resource is already done, providing a set of baselines
    for the research community.'

  abstract: Semantic relations play an important role in linguistic knowledge representation.
    Although their role is relevant in the context of written text, there is no approach
    or dataset that makes use of contextuality of classic semantic relations beyond
    the boundary of one sentence. We present the SemRelData dataset that contains
    annotations of semantic relations between nominals in the context of one paragraph.
    To be able to analyse the universality of this context notion, the annotation
    was performed on a multi-lingual and multi-genre corpus. To evaluate the dataset,
    it is compared to large, manually created knowledge resources in the respective
    languages. The comparison shows that knowledge bases not only have coverage gaps;
    they also do not account for semantic relations that are manifested in particular
    contexts only, yet still play an important role for text cohesion.

  abstract: There is a rich flora of word space models that have proven their efficiency
    in many different applications including information retrieval (Dumais, 1988),
    word sense disambiguation (Schutze, 1992), various semantic knowledge tests (Lund
    et al., 1995; Karlgren, 2001), and text categorization (Sahlgren, 2005). Based
    on the assumption that each model captures some aspects of word meanings and provides
    its own empirical evidence, we present in this paper a systematic exploration
    of the principal corpus-based word space models for bilingual terminology extraction
    from comparable corpora. We find that, once we have identified the best procedures,
    a very simple combination approach leads to significant improvements compared
    to individual models.

  abstract: "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) relies on the availability of rich\
    \ parallel corpora. However, in the case of under-resourced languages or some\
    \ specific domains, parallel corpora are not readily available. This leads to\
    \ under-performing machine translation systems in those sparse data settings.\
    \ To overcome the low availability of parallel resources the machine translation\
    \ community has recognized the potential of using comparable resources as training\
    \ data. However, most efforts have been related to European languages and less\
    \ in middle-east languages. In this study, we report comparable corpora created\
    \ from news articles for the pair English \u2015{Arabic, Persian, Urdu} languages.\
    \ The data has been collected over a period of a year, entails Arabic, Persian\
    \ and Urdu languages. Furthermore using the English as a pivot language, comparable\
    \ corpora that involve more than one language can be created, e.g. English- Arabic\
    \ - Persian, English - Arabic - Urdu, English \u2015 Urdu - Persian, etc. Upon\
    \ request the data can be provided for research purposes."

  abstract: In an intercomprehension scenario, typically a native speaker of language
    L1 is confronted with output from an unknown, but related language L2. In this
    setting, the degree to which the receiver recognizes the unfamiliar words greatly
    determines communicative success. Despite exhibiting great string-level differences,
    cognates may be recognized very successfully if the receiver is aware of regular
    correspondences which allow to transform the unknown word into its familiar form.
    Modeling L1-L2 intercomprehension then requires the identification of all the
    regular correspondences between languages L1 and L2. We here present a set of
    linguistic orthographic correspondences manually compiled from comparative linguistics
    literature along with a set of statistically-inferred suggestions for correspondence
    rules. In order to do statistical inference, we followed the Minimum Description
    Length principle, which proposes to choose those rules which are most effective
    at describing the data. Our statistical model was able to reproduce most of our
    linguistic correspondences (88.5% for Czech-Polish and 75.7% for Bulgarian-Russian)
    and furthermore allowed to easily identify many more non-trivial correspondences
    which also cover aspects of morphology.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the project called Axolotl which comprises a Spanish-Nahuatl
    parallel corpus and its search interface. Spanish and Nahuatl are distant languages
    spoken in the same country. Due to the scarcity of digital resources, we describe
    the several problems that arose when compiling this corpus: most of our sources
    were non-digital books, we faced errors when digitizing the sources and there
    were difficulties in the sentence alignment process, just to mention some. The
    documents of the parallel corpus are not homogeneous, they were extracted from
    different sources, there is dialectal, diachronical, and orthographical variation.
    Additionally, we present a web search interface that allows to make queries through
    the whole parallel corpus, the system is capable to retrieve the parallel fragments
    that contain a word or phrase searched by a user in any of the languages. To our
    knowledge, this is the first Spanish-Nahuatl public available digital parallel
    corpus. We think that this resource can be useful to develop language technologies
    and linguistic studies for this language pair.'

  abstract: Bilingual communities often alternate between languages both in spoken
    and written communication. One such community, Germany residents of Turkish origin
    produce Turkish-German code-switching, by heavily mixing two languages at discourse,
    sentence, or word level. Code-switching in general, and Turkish-German code-switching
    in particular, has been studied for a long time from a linguistic perspective.
    Yet resources to study them from a more computational perspective are limited
    due to either small size or licence issues. In this work we contribute the solution
    of this problem with a corpus. We present a Turkish-German code-switching corpus
    which consists of 1029 tweets, with a majority of intra-sentential switches. We
    share different type of code-switching we have observed in our collection and
    describe our processing steps. The first step is data collection and filtering.
    This is followed by manual tokenisation and normalisation. And finally, we annotate
    data with word-level language identification information. The resulting corpus
    is available for research purposes.

  abstract: In this work, we present the Language Computer Corporation (LCC) annotated
    metaphor datasets, which represent the largest and most comprehensive resource
    for metaphor research to date. These datasets were produced over the course of
    three years by a staff of nine annotators working in four languages (English,
    Spanish, Russian, and Farsi). As part of these datasets, we provide (1) metaphoricity
    ratings for within-sentence word pairs on a four-point scale, (2) scored links
    to our repository of 114 source concept domains and 32 target concept domains,
    and (3) ratings for the affective polarity and intensity of each pair. Altogether,
    we provide 188,741 annotations in English (for 80,100 pairs), 159,915 annotations
    in Spanish (for 63,188 pairs), 99,740 annotations in Russian (for 44,632 pairs),
    and 137,186 annotations in Farsi (for 57,239 pairs). In addition, we are providing
    a large set of likely metaphors which have been independently extracted by our
    two state-of-the-art metaphor detection systems but which have not been analyzed
    by our team of annotators.

  abstract: 'We present our effort to create a large Multi-Layered representational
    repository of Linguistic Code-Switched Arabic data. The process involves developing
    clear annotation standards and Guidelines, streamlining the annotation process,
    and implementing quality control measures. We used two main protocols for annotation:
    in-lab gold annotations and crowd sourcing annotations. We developed a web-based
    annotation tool to facilitate the management of the annotation process. The current
    version of the repository contains a total of 886,252 tokens that are tagged into
    one of sixteen code-switching tags. The data exhibits code switching between Modern
    Standard Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Arabic representing three data genres:
    Tweets, commentaries, and discussion fora. The overall Inter-Annotator Agreement
    is 93.1%.'

  abstract: The overarching objective underlying this research is to develop an online
    tool, based on a parallel corpus of French Belgian Sign Language (LSFB) and written
    Belgian French. This tool is aimed to assist various set of tasks related to the
    comparison of LSFB and French, to the benefit of general users as well as teachers
    in bilingual schools, translators and interpreters, as well as linguists. These
    tasks include (1) the comprehension of LSFB or French texts, (2) the production
    of LSFB or French texts, (3) the translation between LSFB and French in both directions
    and (4) the contrastive analysis of these languages. The first step of investigation
    aims at creating an unidirectional French-LSFB concordancer, able to align a one-
    or multiple-word expression from the French translated text with its corresponding
    expressions in the videotaped LSFB productions. We aim at testing the efficiency
    of this concordancer for the extraction of a dictionary of meanings in context.
    In this paper, we will present the modelling of the different data sources at
    our disposal and specifically the way they interact with one another.

  abstract: "The listener\u2019s gazing activities during utterances were analyzed\
    \ in a face-to-face three-party conversation setting. The function of each utterance\
    \ was categorized according to the Grounding Acts defined by Traum (Traum, 1994)\
    \ so that gazes during utterances could be analyzed from the viewpoint of grounding\
    \ in communication (Clark, 1996). Quantitative analysis showed that the listeners\
    \ were gazing at the speakers more in the second language (L2) conversation than\
    \ in the native language (L1) conversation during the utterances that added new\
    \ pieces of information, suggesting that they are using visual information to\
    \ compensate for their lack of linguistic proficiency in L2 conversation."

  abstract: We present FlexTag, a highly flexible PoS tagging framework. In contrast
    to monolithic implementations that can only be retrained but not adapted otherwise,
    FlexTag enables users to modify the feature space and the classification algorithm.
    Thus, FlexTag makes it easy to quickly develop custom-made taggers exactly fitting
    the research problem.

  abstract: In this paper we present newly developed inflectional lexcions and manually
    annotated corpora of Croatian and Serbian. We introduce hrLex and srLex - two
    freely available inflectional lexicons of Croatian and Serbian - and describe
    the process of building these lexicons, supported by supervised machine learning
    techniques for lemma and paradigm prediction. Furthermore, we introduce hr500k,
    a manually annotated corpus of Croatian, 500 thousand tokens in size. We showcase
    the three newly developed resources on the task of morphosyntactic annotation
    of both languages by using a recently developed CRF tagger. We achieve best results
    yet reported on the task for both languages, beating the HunPos baseline trained
    on the same datasets by a wide margin.

  abstract: TGermaCorp is a German text corpus whose primary sources are collected
    from German literature texts which date from the sixteenth century to the present.
    The corpus is intended to represent its target language (German) in syntactic,
    lexical, stylistic and chronological diversity. For this purpose, it is hand-annotated
    on several linguistic layers, including POS, lemma, named entities, multiword
    expressions, clauses, sentences and paragraphs. In order to introduce TGermaCorp
    in comparison to more homogeneous corpora of contemporary everyday language, quantitative
    assessments of syntactic and lexical diversity are provided. In this respect,
    TGermaCorp contributes to establishing characterising features for resource descriptions,
    which is needed for keeping track of a meaningful comparison of the ever-growing
    number of natural language resources. The assessments confirm the special role
    of proper names, whose propagation in text may influence lexical and syntactic
    diversity measures in rather trivial ways. TGermaCorp will be made available via
    hucompute.org.

  abstract: In this work we present the open source hunvec framework for sequential
    tagging, built upon Theano and Pylearn2. The underlying statistical model, which
    connects linear CRF-s with neural networks, was used by Collobert and co-workers,
    and several other researchers. For demonstrating the flexibility of our tool,
    we describe a set of experiments on part-of-speech and named-entity-recognition
    tasks, using English and Hungarian datasets, where we modify both model and training
    parameters, and illustrate the usage of custom features. Model parameters we experiment
    with affect the vectorial word representations used by the model; we apply different
    word vector initializations, defined by Word2vec and GloVe embeddings and enrich
    the representation of words by vectors assigned trigram features. We extend training
    methods by using their regularized (l2 and dropout) version. When testing our
    framework on a Hungarian named entity corpus, we find that its performance reaches
    the best published results on this dataset, with no need for language-specific
    feature engineering. Our code is available at http://github.com/zseder/hunvec

  abstract: Most Arabic natural language processing tools and resources are developed
    to serve Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the official written language
    in the Arab World. Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have
    received some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that
    include annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic,
    however, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar Corpus,
    a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words from 1,200
    forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at the document
    level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the morphological annotation
    of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines for a conventional orthography.
    The text of the corpus is publicly browsable through a web interface we developed
    for it.

  abstract: We present a novel technique for Arabic morphological annotation. The
    technique utilizes diacritization to produce morphological annotations of quality
    comparable to human annotators. Although Arabic text is generally written without
    diacritics, diacritization is already available for large corpora of Arabic text
    in several genres. Furthermore, diacritization can be generated at a low cost
    for new text as it does not require specialized training beyond what educated
    Arabic typists know. The basic approach is to enrich the input to a state-of-the-art
    Arabic morphological analyzer with word diacritics (full or partial) to enhance
    its performance. When applied to fully diacritized text, our approach produces
    annotations with an accuracy of over 97% on lemma, part-of-speech, and tokenization
    combined.

  abstract: Part-of-speech tagging is a basic step in Natural Language Processing
    that is often essential. Labeling the word forms of a text with fine-grained word-class
    information adds new value to it and can be a prerequisite for downstream processes
    like a dependency parser. Corpus linguists and lexicographers also benefit greatly
    from the improved search options that are available with tagged data. The Albanian
    language has some properties that pose difficulties for the creation of a part-of-speech
    tagset. In this paper, we discuss those difficulties and present a proposal for
    a part-of-speech tagset that can adequately represent the underlying linguistic
    phenomena.

    and tools and still suffers from the scarcity of linguistic tools and resources.
    The main aim of this paper is to present a new part-of-speech (POS) tagger based
    on a new Amazigh tag set (AMTS) composed of 28 tags. In line with our goal we
    have trained Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to build a POS tagger for the Amazigh
    language. We have used the 10-fold technique to evaluate and validate our approach.
    The CRFs 10 folds average level is 87.95% and the best fold level result is 91.18%.
    In order to improve this result, we have gathered a set of about 8k words with
    their POS tags. The collected lexicon was used with CRFs confidence measure in
    order to have a more accurate POS-tagger. Hence, we have obtained a better performance
    of 93.82%.

  abstract: In this paper, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised methods
    for part-of-speech (PoS) tagging in the context of historical German text. We
    locate our research in the context of Digital Humanities where the non-canonical
    nature of text causes issues facing an Natural Language Processing world in which
    tools are mainly trained on standard data. Data deviating from the norm requires
    tools adjusted to this data. We explore to which extend the availability of such
    training material and resources related to it influences the accuracy of PoS tagging.
    We investigate a variety of algorithms including neural nets, conditional random
    fields and self-learning techniques in order to find the best-fitted approach
    to tackle data sparsity. Although methods using resources from related languages
    outperform weakly supervised methods using just a few training examples, we can
    still reach a promising accuracy with methods abstaining additional resources.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present the ongoing efforts to expand the depth and
    breath of the Open Multilingual Wordnet coverage by introducing two new classes
    of non-referential concepts to wordnet hierarchies: interjections and numeral
    classifiers. The lexical semantic hierarchy pioneered by Princeton Wordnet has
    traditionally restricted its coverage to referential and contentful classes of
    words: such as nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Previous efforts have been
    employed to enrich wordnet resources including, for example, the inclusion of
    pronouns, determiners and quantifiers within their hierarchies. Following similar
    efforts, and motivated by the ongoing semantic annotation of the NTU-Multilingual
    Corpus, we decided that the four traditional classes of words present in wordnets
    were too restrictive. Though non-referential, interjections and classifiers possess
    interesting semantics features that can be well captured by lexical resources
    like wordnets. In this paper, we will further motivate our decision to include
    non-referential concepts in wordnets and give an account of the current state
    of this expansion.'

  abstract: Although represented as such in wordnets, word senses are not discrete.
    To handle word senses as fuzzy objects, we exploit the graph structure of synonymy
    pairs acquired from different sources to discover synsets where words have different
    membership degrees that reflect confidence. Following this approach, a wide-coverage
    fuzzy thesaurus was discovered from a synonymy network compiled from seven Portuguese
    lexical-semantic resources. Based on a crowdsourcing evaluation, we can say that
    the quality of the obtained synsets is far from perfect but, as expected in a
    confidence measure, it increases significantly for higher cut-points on the membership
    and, at a certain point, reaches 100% correction rate.

  abstract: 'Among all researches dedicating to terminology and word sense disambiguation,
    little attention has been devoted to the ambiguity of term occurrences. If a lexical
    unit is indeed a term of the domain, it is not true, even in a specialised corpus,
    that all its occurrences are terminological. Some occurrences are terminological
    and other are not. Thus, a global decision at the corpus level about the terminological
    status of all occurrences of a lexical unit would then be erroneous. In this paper,
    we propose three original methods to characterise the ambiguity of term occurrences
    in the domain of social sciences for French. These methods differently model the
    context of the term occurrences: one is relying on text mining, the second is
    based on textometry, and the last one focuses on text genre properties. The experimental
    results show the potential of the proposed approaches and give an opportunity
    to discuss about their hybridisation.'

    \ provided via TEI annotation. Examples for possible areas of research and usage\
    \ scenarios are provided based on the German historical corpus of the Deutsches\

    \ The paper shows that by including TEI-XML structuring in corpus-based analyses\
    \ significances can be observed for different linguistic phenomena, as e.g. the\
    \ development of conceptual text structures themselves, the syntactic embedding\
    \ of terms in certain conceptual text structures, and phenomena of language change\
    \ which become obvious via the layout of a text. The exemplary study carried out\
    \ here shows some of the potential for the exploitation of TEI annotation for\

  abstract: Streaming media provides a number of unique challenges for computational
    linguistics. This paper studies the temporal variation in word co-occurrence statistics,
    with application to event detection. We develop a spectral clustering approach
    to find groups of mutually informative terms occurring in discrete time frames.
    Experiments on large datasets of tweets show that these groups identify key real
    world events as they occur in time, despite no explicit supervision. The performance
    of our method rivals state-of-the-art methods for event detection on F-score,
    obtaining higher recall at the expense of precision.

  abstract: Joint inference approaches such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and
    Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) have recently been successfully applied to many natural
    language processing (NLP) tasks, often outperforming their pipeline counterparts.
    However, MLNs are arguably much less popular among NLP researchers than ILP. While
    NLP researchers who desire to employ these joint inference frameworks do not necessarily
    have to understand their theoretical underpinnings, it is imperative that they
    understand which of them should be applied under what circumstances. With the
    goal of helping NLP researchers better understand the relative strengths and weaknesses
    of MLNs and ILP; we will compare them along different dimensions of interest,
    such as expressiveness, ease of use, scalability, and performance. To our knowledge,
    this is the first systematic comparison of ILP and MLNs on an NLP task.

  abstract: A significant portion of data generated on blogging and microblogging
    websites is non-credible as shown in many recent studies. To filter out such non-credible
    information, machine learning can be deployed to build automatic credibility classifiers.
    However, as in the case with most supervised machine learning approaches, a sufficiently
    large and accurate training data must be available. In this paper, we focus on
    building a public Arabic corpus of blogs and microblogs that can be used for credibility
    classification. We focus on Arabic due to the recent popularity of blogs and microblogs
    in the Arab World and due to the lack of any such public corpora in Arabic. We
    discuss our data acquisition approach and annotation process, provide rigid analysis
    on the annotated data and finally report some results on the effectiveness of
    our data for credibility classification.

  abstract: "Active learning (AL) is often used in corpus construction (CC) for selecting\
    \ \u201Cinformative\u201D documents for annotation. This is ideal for focusing\
    \ annotation efforts when all documents cannot be annotated, but has the limitation\
    \ that it is carried out in a closed-loop, selecting points that will improve\
    \ an existing model. For phenomena-driven and exploratory CC, the lack of existing-models\
    \ and specific task(s) for using it make traditional AL inapplicable. In this\
    \ paper we propose a novel method for model-free AL utilising characteristics\
    \ of phenomena for applying AL to select documents for annotation. The method\
    \ can also supplement traditional closed-loop AL-based CC to extend the utility\
    \ of the corpus created beyond a single task. We introduce our tool, MOVE, and\
    \ show its potential with a real world case-study."

    \ Dutch. MEANTIME contains annotations at different levels. The document-level\
    \ annotation includes markables (e.g. entity mentions, event mentions, time expressions,\
    \ and numerical expressions), relations between markables (modeling, for example,\
    \ temporal information and semantic role labeling), and entity and event intra-document\
    \ coreference. The corpus-level annotation includes entity and event cross-document\
    \ coreference. Semantic annotation on the English section was performed manually;\
    \ for the annotation in Italian, Spanish, and (partially) Dutch, a procedure was\
    \ devised to automatically project the annotations on the English texts onto the\
    \ translated texts, based on the manual alignment of the annotated elements; this\
    \ enabled us not only to speed up the annotation process but also provided cross-lingual\

  abstract: Annotating and predicting behavioural aspects in conversations is becoming
    critical in the conversational analytics industry. In this paper we look into
    inter-annotator agreement of agent behaviour dimensions on two call center corpora.
    We find that the task can be annotated consistently over time, but that subjectivity
    issues impacts the quality of the annotation. The reformulation of some of the
    annotated dimensions is suggested in order to improve agreement.

    \ manner. For this purpose, we conducted a survey of everyday conversational behavior,\
    \ with about 250 adults, in order to reveal how diverse our everyday conversational\
    \ behavior is and to build an empirical foundation for corpus design. The questionnaire\
    \ included when, where, how long,with whom, and in what kind of activity informants\
    \ were engaged in conversations. We found that ordinary conversations show the\
    \ following tendencies: i) they mainly consist of chats, business talks, and consultations;\
    \ ii) in general, the number of participants is small and the duration of the\
    \ conversation is short; iii) many conversations are conducted in private places\
    \ such as homes, as well as in public places such as offices and schools; and\
    \ iv) some questionnaire items are related to each other. This paper describes\
    \ an overview of this survey study, and then discusses how to design a large-scale\

  abstract: This papers describes a data collection setup and a newly recorded dataset.
    The main purpose of this dataset is to explore patterns in the focus of visual
    attention of humans under three different conditions - two humans involved in
    task-based interaction with a robot; same two humans involved in task-based interaction
    where the robot is replaced by a third human, and a free three-party human interaction.
    The dataset contains two parts - 6 sessions with duration of approximately 3 hours
    and 9 sessions with duration of approximately 4.5 hours. Both parts of the dataset
    are rich in modalities and recorded data streams - they include the streams of
    three Kinect v2 devices (color, depth, infrared, body and face data), three high
    quality audio streams, three high resolution GoPro video streams, touch data for
    the task-based interactions and the system state of the robot. In addition, the
    second part of the dataset introduces the data streams from three Tobii Pro Glasses
    2 eye trackers. The language of all interactions is English and all data streams
    are spatially and temporally aligned.

  abstract: Large scale corpora have benefited many areas of research in natural language
    processing, but until recently, resources for dialogue have lagged behind. Now,
    with the emergence of large scale social media websites incorporating a threaded
    dialogue structure, content feedback, and self-annotation (such as stance labeling),
    there are valuable new corpora available to researchers. In previous work, we
    released the INTERNET ARGUMENT CORPUS, one of the first larger scale resources
    available for opinion sharing dialogue. We now release the INTERNET ARGUMENT CORPUS
    2.0 (IAC 2.0) in the hope that others will find it as useful as we have. The IAC
    2.0 provides more data than IAC 1.0 and organizes it using an extensible, repurposable
    SQL schema. The database structure in conjunction with the associated code facilitates
    querying from and combining multiple dialogically structured data sources. The
    IAC 2.0 schema provides support for forum posts, quotations, markup (bold, italic,
    etc), and various annotations, including Stanford CoreNLP annotations. We demonstrate
    the generalizablity of the schema by providing code to import the ConVote corpus.

  abstract: Casual multiparty conversation is an understudied but very common genre
    of spoken interaction, whose analysis presents a number of challenges in terms
    of data scarcity and annotation. We describe the annotation process used on the
    d64 and DANS multimodal corpora of multiparty casual talk, which have been manually
    segmented, transcribed, annotated for laughter and disfluencies, and aligned using
    the Penn Aligner. We also describe a visualization tool, STAVE, developed during
    the annotation process, which allows long stretches of talk or indeed entire conversations
    to be viewed, aiding preliminary identification of features and patterns worthy
    of analysis. It is hoped that this tool will be of use to other researchers working
    in this field.

  abstract: In order to develop its full potential, global communication needs linguistic
    support systems such as Machine Translation (MT). In the past decade, free online
    MT tools have become available to the general public, and the quality of their
    output is increasing. However, the use of such tools may entail various legal
    implications, especially as far as processing of personal data is concerned. This
    is even more evident if we take into account that their business model is largely
    based on providing translation in exchange for data, which can subsequently be
    used to improve the translation model, but also for commercial purposes. The purpose
    of this paper is to examine how free online MT tools fit in the European data
    protection framework, harmonised by the EU Data Protection Directive. The perspectives
    of both the user and the MT service provider are taken into account.

  abstract: Since mobile devices have feature-rich configurations and provide diverse
    functions, the use of mobile devices combined with the language resources of cloud
    environments is high promising for achieving a wide range communication that goes
    beyond the current language barrier. However, there are mismatches between using
    resources of mobile devices and services in the cloud such as the different communication
    protocol and different input and output methods. In this paper, we propose a language
    service infrastructure for mobile environments to combine these services. The
    proposed language service infrastructure allows users to use and mashup existing
    language resources on both cloud environments and their mobile devices. Furthermore,
    it allows users to flexibly use services in the cloud or services on mobile devices
    in their composite service without implementing several different composite services
    that have the same functionality. A case study of Mobile Shopping Translation
    System using both a service in the cloud (translation service) and services on
    mobile devices (Bluetooth low energy (BLE) service and text-to-speech service)
    is introduced.

  abstract: In this paper, we discuss the requirements that a long lasting linguistic
    database should have in order to meet the needs of the linguists together with
    the aim of durability and sharing of data. In particular, we discuss the generalizability
    of the Syntactic Atlas of Italy, a linguistic project that builds on a long standing
    tradition of collecting and analyzing linguistic corpora, on a more recent project
    that focuses on the synchronic and diachronic analysis of the syntax of Italian
    and Portuguese relative clauses. The results that are presented are in line with
    the FLaReNet Strategic Agenda that highlighted the most pressing needs for research
    areas, such as Natural Language Processing, and presented a set of recommendations
    for the development and progress of Language resources in Europe.

  abstract: The infrastructure Global Open Resources and Information for Language
    and Linguistic Analysis (GORILLA) was created as a resource that provides a bridge
    between disciplines such as documentary, theoretical, and corpus linguistics,
    speech and language technologies, and digital language archiving services. GORILLA
    is designed as an interface between digital language archive services and language
    data producers. It addresses various problems of common digital language archive
    infrastructures. At the same time it serves the speech and language technology
    communities by providing a platform to create and share speech and language data
    from low-resourced and endangered languages. It hosts an initial collection of
    language models for speech and natural language processing (NLP), and technologies
    or software tools for corpus creation and annotation. GORILLA is designed to address
    the Transcription Bottleneck in language documentation, and, at the same time
    to provide solutions to the general Language Resource Bottleneck in speech and
    language technologies. It does so by facilitating the cooperation between documentary
    and theoretical linguistics, and speech and language technologies research and
    development, in particular for low-resourced and endangered languages.

  abstract: 'This paper introduces an open source, interoperable generic software
    tool set catering for the entire workflow of creation, migration, annotation,
    query and analysis of multi-layer linguistic corpora. It consists of four components:
    Salt, a graph-based meta model and API for linguistic data, the common data model
    for the rest of the tool set; Pepper, a conversion tool and platform for linguistic
    data that can be used to convert many different linguistic formats into each other;
    Atomic, an extensible, platform-independent multi-layer desktop annotation software
    for linguistic corpora; ANNIS, a search and visualization architecture for multi-layer
    linguistic corpora with many different visualizations and a powerful native query
    language. The set was designed to solve the following issues in a multi-layer
    corpus workflow: Lossless data transition between tools through a common data
    model generic enough to allow for a potentially unlimited number of different
    types of annotation, conversion capabilities for different linguistic formats
    to cater for the processing of data from different sources and/or with existing
    annotations, a high level of extensibility to enhance the sustainability of the
    whole tool set, analysis capabilities encompassing corpus and annotation query
    alongside multi-faceted visualizations of all annotation layers.'

  abstract: In this paper, I describe a method of creating massively huge web corpora
    from the CommonCrawl data sets and redistributing the resulting annotations in
    a stand-off format. Current EU (and especially German) copyright legislation categorically
    forbids the redistribution of downloaded material without express prior permission
    by the authors. Therefore, such stand-off annotations (or other derivates) are
    the only format in which European researchers (like myself) are allowed to re-distribute
    the respective corpora. In order to make the full corpora available to the public
    despite such restrictions, the stand-off format presented here allows anybody
    to locally reconstruct the full corpora with the least possible computational
    effort.

  abstract: This paper presents two alternative NLP architectures to analyze massive
    amounts of documents, using parallel processing. The two architectures focus on
    different processing scenarios, namely batch-processing and streaming processing.
    The batch-processing scenario aims at optimizing the overall throughput of the
    system, i.e., minimizing the overall time spent on processing all documents. The
    streaming architecture aims to minimize the time to process real-time incoming
    documents and is therefore especially suitable for live feeds. The paper presents
    experiments with both architectures, and reports the overall gain when they are
    used for batch as well as for streaming processing. All the software described
    in the paper is publicly available under free licenses.

  abstract: 'In 2014, the Swedish government tasked a Swedish agency, The Swedish
    Post and Telecom Authority (PTS), with investigating how to best create and populate
    an infrastructure for spoken language resources (Ref N2014/2840/ITP). As a part
    of this work, the department of Speech, Music and Hearing at KTH Royal Institute
    of Technology have taken inventory of existing potential spoken language resources,
    mainly in Swedish national archives and other governmental or public institutions.
    In this position paper, key priorities, perspectives, and strategies that may
    be of general, rather than Swedish, interest are presented. We discuss broad types
    of potential spoken language resources available; to what extent these resources
    are free to use; and thirdly the main contribution: strategies to ensure the continuous
    acquisition of spoken language resources in a manner that facilitates speech and
    speech technology research.'

  abstract: This paper discusses the role that statistical machine translation (SMT)
    can play in the development of cross-border EU e-commerce,by highlighting extant
    obstacles and identifying relevant technologies to overcome them. In this sense,
    it firstly proposes a typology of e-commerce static and dynamic textual genres
    and it identifies those that may be more successfully targeted by SMT. The specific
    challenges concerning the automatic translation of user-generated content are
    discussed in detail. Secondly, the paper highlights the risk of data sparsity
    inherent to e-commerce and it explores the state-of-the-art strategies to achieve
    domain adequacy via adaptation. Thirdly, it proposes a robust workflow for the
    development of SMT systems adapted to the e-commerce domain by relying on inexpensive
    methods. Given the scarcity of user-generated language corpora for most language
    pairs, the paper proposes to obtain monolingual target-language data to train
    language models and aligned parallel corpora to tune and evaluate MT systems by
    means of crowdsourcing.

  abstract: ROOT9 is a supervised system for the classification of hypernyms, co-hyponyms
    and random words that is derived from the already introduced ROOT13 (Santus et
    al., 2016). It relies on a Random Forest algorithm and nine unsupervised corpus-based
    features. We evaluate it with a 10-fold cross validation on 9,600 pairs, equally
    distributed among the three classes and involving several Parts-Of-Speech (i.e.
    adjectives, nouns and verbs). When all the classes are present, ROOT9 achieves
    an F1 score of 90.7%, against a baseline of 57.2% (vector cosine). When the classification
    is binary, ROOT9 achieves the following results against the baseline. hypernyms-co-hyponyms
    95.7% vs. 69.8%, hypernyms-random 91.8% vs. 64.1% and co-hyponyms-random 97.8%
    vs. 79.4%. In order to compare the performance with the state-of-the-art, we have
    also evaluated ROOT9 in subsets of the Weeds et al. (2014) datasets, proving that
    it is in fact competitive. Finally, we investigated whether the system learns
    the semantic relation or it simply learns the prototypical hypernyms, as claimed
    by Levy et al. (2015). The second possibility seems to be the most likely, even
    though ROOT9 can be trained on negative examples (i.e., switched hypernyms) to
    drastically reduce this bias.

  abstract: "In this paper, we claim that Vector Cosine \u2015 which is generally\
    \ considered one of the most efficient unsupervised measures for identifying word\
    \ similarity in Vector Space Models \u2015 can be outperformed by a completely\
    \ unsupervised measure that evaluates the extent of the intersection among the\
    \ most associated contexts of two target words, weighting such intersection according\
    \ to the rank of the shared contexts in the dependency ranked lists. This claim\
    \ comes from the hypothesis that similar words do not simply occur in similar\
    \ contexts, but they share a larger portion of their most relevant contexts compared\
    \ to other related words. To prove it, we describe and evaluate APSyn, a variant\
    \ of Average Precision that \u2015 independently of the adopted parameters \u2015\
    \ outperforms the Vector Cosine and the co-occurrence on the ESL and TOEFL test\
    \ sets. In the best setting, APSyn reaches 0.73 accuracy on the ESL dataset and\
    \ 0.70 accuracy in the TOEFL dataset, beating therefore the non-English US college\
    \ applicants (whose average, as reported in the literature, is 64.50%) and several\

  abstract: The paper investigates the relation between metaphoricity and distributional
    characteristics of verbs, introducing POM, a corpus-derived index that can be
    used to define the upper bound of metaphoricity of any expression in which a given
    verb occurs. The work moves from the observation that while some verbs can be
    used to create highly metaphoric expressions, others can not. We conjecture that
    this fact is related to the number of contexts in which a verb occurs and to the
    frequency of each context. This intuition is modelled by introducing a method
    in which each context of a verb in a corpus is assigned a vector representation,
    and a clustering algorithm is employed to identify similar contexts. Eventually,
    the Standard Deviation of the relative frequency values of the clusters is computed
    and taken as the POM of the target verb. We tested POM in two experimental settings
    obtaining values of accuracy of 84% and 92%. Since we are convinced, along with
    (Shutoff, 2015), that metaphor detection systems should be concerned only with
    the identification of highly metaphoric expressions, we believe that POM could
    be profitably employed by these systems to a priori exclude expressions that,
    due to the verb they include, can only have low degrees of metaphoricity

  abstract: "This work presents a practical system for indexing terms and relations\
    \ from French radiology reports, called IMAIOS. In this paper, we present how\
    \ semantic relations (causes, consequences, symptoms, locations, parts...) between\
    \ medical terms can be extracted. For this purpose, we handcrafted some linguistic\
    \ patterns from on a subset of our radiology report corpora. As semantic patterns\
    \ (de (of)) may be too general or ambiguous, semantic constraints have been added.\
    \ For instance, in the sentence n\xE9oplasie du sein (neoplasm of breast) the\
    \ system knowing neoplasm as a disease and breast as an anatomical location, identify\
    \ the relation as being a location: neoplasm r-lieu breast. An evaluation of the\
    \ effect of semantic constraints is proposed."

  abstract: "Distributional semantic models (DSMs) are currently being used in the\
    \ measurement of word relatedness and word similarity. One shortcoming of DSMs\
    \ is that they do not provide a principled way to discriminate different semantic\
    \ relations. Several approaches have been adopted that rely on annotated data\
    \ either in the training of the model or later in its evaluation. In this paper,\
    \ we introduce a dataset for training and evaluating DSMs on semantic relations\
    \ discrimination between words, in Mandarin, Chinese. The construction of the\
    \ dataset followed EVALution 1.0, which is an English dataset for the training\
    \ and evaluating of DSMs. The dataset contains 360 relation pairs, distributed\
    \ in five different semantic relations, including antonymy, synonymy, hypernymy,\
    \ meronymy and nearsynonymy. All relation pairs were checked manually to estimate\
    \ their quality. In the 360 word relation pairs, there are 373 relata. They were\
    \ all extracted and subsequently manually tagged according to their semantic type.\
    \ The relatas\u2019 frequency was calculated in a combined corpus of Sinica and\
    \ Chinese Gigaword. To the best of our knowledge, EVALution-MAN is the first of\
    \ its kind for Mandarin, Chinese."

  abstract: We present a statistical system for identifying the semantic relationships
    or semantic roles for two major Indian Languages, Hindi and Urdu. Given an input
    sentence and a predicate/verb, the system first identifies the arguments pertaining
    to that verb and then classifies it into one of the semantic labels which can
    either be a DOER, THEME, LOCATIVE, CAUSE, PURPOSE etc. The system is based on
    2 statistical classifiers trained on roughly 130,000 words for Urdu and 100,000
    words for Hindi that were hand-annotated with semantic roles under the PropBank
    project for these two languages. Our system achieves an accuracy of 86% in identifying
    the arguments of a verb for Hindi and 75% for Urdu. At the subsequent task of
    classifying the constituents into their semantic roles, the Hindi system achieved
    58% precision and 42% recall whereas Urdu system performed better and achieved
    83% precision and 80% recall. Our study also allowed us to compare the usefulness
    of different linguistic features and feature combinations in the semantic role
    labeling task. We also examine the use of statistical syntactic parsing as feature
    in the role labeling task.

  abstract: Verb aspect is a grammatical and lexical category that encodes temporal
    unfolding and duration of events described by verbs. It is a potentially interesting
    source of information for various computational tasks, but has so far not been
    studied in much depth from the perspective of automatic processing. Slavic languages
    are particularly interesting in this respect, as they encode aspect through complex
    and not entirely consistent lexical derivations involving prefixation and suffixation.
    Focusing on Croatian and Serbian, in this paper we propose a novel framework for
    automatic classification of their verb types into a number of fine-grained aspectual
    classes based on the observable morphology of verb forms. In addition, we provide
    a set of around 2000 verbs classified based on our framework. This set can be
    used for linguistic research as well as for testing automatic classification on
    a larger scale. With minor adjustments the approach is also applicable to other
    Slavic languages

    as information extraction, question answering or summarisation, for which evidence
    from multiple sentences needs to be combined. We report on a new 3-way judgement
    Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) resource that originates in the Social Media
    domain, and explain our semi-automatic creation method for the special purpose
    of information verification, which draws on manually established rumourous claims
    reported during crisis events. From about 500 English tweets related to 70 unique
    claims we compile and evaluate 5.4k RTE pairs, while continue automatizing the
    workflow to generate similar-sized datasets in other languages.

  abstract: We present the specification for a modeling language, VoxML, which encodes
    semantic knowledge of real-world objects represented as three-dimensional models,
    and of events and attributes related to and enacted over these objects.VoxML is
    intended to overcome the limitations of existing 3D visual markup languages by
    allowing for the encoding of a broad range of semantic knowledge that can be exploited
    by a variety of systems and platforms, leading to multimodal simulations of real-world
    scenarios using conceptual objects that represent their semantic values

  abstract: "Metonymy is a figure of speech in which one item\u2019s name represents\
    \ another item that usually has a close relation with the first one. Metonymic\
    \ expressions need to be correctly detected and interpreted because sentences\
    \ including such expressions have different mean- ings from literal ones; computer\
    \ systems may output inappropriate results in natural language processing. In\
    \ this paper, an associative approach for analyzing metonymic expressions is proposed.\
    \ By using associative information and two conceptual distances between words\
    \ in a sentence, a previous method is enhanced and a decision tree is trained\
    \ to detect metonymic expressions. After detecting these expressions, they are\
    \ interpreted as metonymic understanding words by using associative information.\
    \ This method was evaluated by comparing it with two baseline methods based on\
    \ previous studies on the Japanese language that used case frames and co-occurrence\
    \ information. As a result, the proposed method exhibited significantly better\
    \ accuracy (0.85) of determining words as metonymic or literal expressions than\
    \ the baselines. It also exhibited better accuracy (0.74) of interpreting the\
    \ detected metonymic expressions than the baselines."

  abstract: "Our ability to understand language often relies on common-sense knowledge\
    \ \u2015 background information the speaker can assume is known by the reader.\
    \ Similarly, our comprehension of the language used in complex domains relies\
    \ on access to domain-specific knowledge. Capturing common-sense and domain-specific\
    \ knowledge can be achieved by taking advantage of recent advances in open information\
    \ extraction (IE) techniques and, more importantly, of knowledge embeddings, which\
    \ are multi-dimensional representations of concepts and relations. Building a\
    \ knowledge graph for representing common-sense knowledge in which concepts discerned\
    \ from noun phrases are cast as vertices and lexicalized relations are cast as\
    \ edges leads to learning the embeddings of common-sense knowledge accounting\
    \ for semantic compositionality as well as implied knowledge. Common-sense knowledge\
    \ is acquired from a vast collection of blogs and books as well as from WordNet.\
    \ Similarly, medical knowledge is learned from two large sets of electronic health\
    \ records. The evaluation results of these two forms of knowledge are promising:\
    \ the same knowledge acquisition methodology based on learning knowledge embeddings\
    \ works well both for common-sense knowledge and for medical knowledge Interestingly,\
    \ the common-sense knowledge that we have acquired was evaluated as being less\
    \ neutral than than the medical knowledge, as it often reflected the opinion of\
    \ the knowledge utterer. In addition, the acquired medical knowledge was evaluated\
    \ as more plausible than the common-sense knowledge, reflecting the complexity\
    \ of acquiring common-sense knowledge due to the pragmatics and economicity of\

  abstract: In recent years, we have seen an increasing amount of interest in low-dimensional
    vector representations of words. Among other things, these facilitate computing
    word similarity and relatedness scores. The most well-known example of algorithms
    to produce representations of this sort are the word2vec approaches. In this paper,
    we investigate a new model to induce such vector spaces for medical concepts,
    based on a joint objective that exploits not only word co-occurrences but also
    manually labeled documents, as available from sources such as PubMed. Our extensive
    experimental analysis shows that our embeddings lead to significantly higher correlations
    with human similarity and relatedness assessments than previous work. Due to the
    simplicity and versatility of vector representations, these findings suggest that
    our resource can easily be used as a drop-in replacement to improve any systems
    relying on medical concept similarity measures.

  abstract: We present a corpus of time-aligned spoken data of Wikipedia articles
    as well as the pipeline that allows to generate such corpora for many languages.
    There are initiatives to create and sustain spoken Wikipedia versions in many
    languages and hence the data is freely available, grows over time, and can be
    used for automatic corpus creation. Our pipeline automatically downloads and aligns
    this data. The resulting German corpus currently totals 293h of audio, of which
    we align 71h in full sentences and another 86h of sentences with some missing
    words. The English corpus consists of 287h, for which we align 27h in full sentence
    and 157h with some missing words. Results are publically available.

  abstract: In this Paper we present a corpus named SXUCorpus which contains read
    and spontaneous speech of the Upper Saxon German dialect. The data has been collected
    from eight archives of local television stations located in the Free State of
    Saxony. The recordings include broadcasted topics of news, economy, weather, sport,
    and documentation from the years 1992 to 1996 and have been manually transcribed
    and labeled. In the paper, we report the methodology of collecting and processing
    analog audiovisual material, constructing the corpus and describe the properties
    of the data. In its current version, the corpus is available to the scientific
    community and is designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) evaluation with
    a development set and a test set. We performed ASR experiments with the open-source
    framework sphinx-4 including a configuration for Standard German on the dataset.
    Additionally, we show the influence of acoustic model and language model adaptation
    by the utilization of the development set.

  abstract: This paper presents the TYPALOC corpus of French Dysarthric and Healthy
    speech and the rationale underlying its constitution. The objective is to compare
    phonetic variation in the speech of dysarthric vs. healthy speakers in different
    speech conditions (read and unprepared speech). More precisely, we aim to compare
    the extent, types and location of phonetic variation within these different populations
    and speech conditions. The TYPALOC corpus is constituted of a selection of 28
    dysarthric patients (three different pathologies) and of 12 healthy control speakers
    recorded while reading the same text and in a more natural continuous speech condition.
    Each audio signal has been segmented into Inter-Pausal Units. Then, the corpus
    has been manually transcribed and automatically aligned. The alignment has been
    corrected by an expert phonetician. Moreover, the corpus benefits from an automatic
    syllabification and an Automatic Detection of Acoustic Phone-Based Anomalies.
    Finally, in order to interpret phonetic variations due to pathologies, a perceptual
    evaluation of each patient has been conducted. Quantitative data are provided
    at the end of the paper.

  abstract: We present a new speech database containing 18.5 hours of annotated radio
    broadcasts in the Frisian language. Frisian is mostly spoken in the province Fryslan
    and it is the second official language of the Netherlands. The recordings are
    collected from the archives of Omrop Fryslan, the regional public broadcaster
    of the province Fryslan. The database covers almost a 50-year time span. The native
    speakers of Frisian are mostly bilingual and often code-switch in daily conversations
    due to the extensive influence of the Dutch language. Considering the longitudinal
    and code-switching nature of the data, an appropriate annotation protocol has
    been designed and the data is manually annotated with the orthographic transcription,
    speaker identities, dialect information, code-switching details and background
    noise/music information.

  abstract: This paper presents a new Slovenian spoken language resource built from
    TEDx Talks. The speech database contains 242 talks in total duration of 54 hours.
    The annotation and transcription of acquired spoken material was generated automatically,
    applying acoustic segmentation and automatic speech recognition. The development
    and evaluation subset was also manually transcribed using the guidelines specified
    for the Slovenian GOS corpus. The manual transcriptions were used to evaluate
    the quality of unsupervised transcriptions. The average word error rate for the
    SI TEDx-UM evaluation subset was 50.7%, with out of vocabulary rate of 24% and
    language model perplexity of 390. The unsupervised transcriptions contain 372k
    tokens, where 32k of them were different.

    \ 100 elderly Japanese people, to improve speech recognition accuracy of the speech\
    \ of older people. Humanoid robots are being developed for use in elder care nursing\
    \ homes. Interaction with such robots is expected to help maintain the cognitive\
    \ abilities of nursing home residents, as well as providing them with companionship.\
    \ In order for these robots to interact with elderly people through spoken dialogue,\
    \ a high performance speech recognition system for speech of elderly people is\
    \ needed. To develop such a system, we recorded speech uttered by 100 elderly\
    \ Japanese, most of them are living in nursing homes, with an average age of 77.2.\
    \ Previously, a seniors\u2019 speech corpus named S-JNAS was developed, but the\
    \ average age of the participants was 67.6 years, but the target age for nursing\
    \ home care is around 75 years old, much higher than that of the S-JNAS samples.\
    \ In this paper we compare our new corpus with an existing Japanese read speech\
    \ corpus, JNAS, which consists of adult speech, and with the above mentioned S-JNAS,\
    \ the senior version of JNAS."

  abstract: In this paper, we introduce an extension of our previously released TUKE-BNews-SK
    corpus based on a semi-automatic annotation scheme. It firstly relies on the automatic
    transcription of the BN data performed by our Slovak large vocabulary continuous
    speech recognition system. The generated hypotheses are then manually corrected
    and completed by trained human annotators. The corpus is composed of 25 hours
    of fully-annotated spontaneous and prepared speech. In addition, we have acquired
    900 hours of another BN data, part of which we plan to annotate semi-automatically.
    We present a preliminary corpus evaluation that gives very promising results.

    Yiddish language resources that are used for adaptations of speech and language
    technologies. Our project aims at the development of resources and technologies
    that can make the entire AHEYM corpus and other Yiddish resources more accessible
    to not only the community of Yiddish speakers or linguists with language expertise,
    but also historians and experts from other disciplines or the general public.
    In this paper we describe the rationale behind our approach, the procedures and
    methods, and challenges that are not specific to the AHEYM corpus, but apply to
    all documentary language data that is collected in the field. To the best of our
    knowledge, this is the first attempt to create a speech corpus and speech technologies
    for Yiddish. This is also the first attempt to work out speech and language technologies
    to transcribe and translate a large collection of Yiddish spoken language resources.

  abstract: "Text Complexity Analysis is an useful task in Education. For example,\
    \ it can help teachers select appropriate texts for their students according to\
    \ their educational level. This task requires the analysis of several text features\
    \ that people do mostly manually (e.g. syntactic complexity, words variety, etc.).\
    \ In this paper, we present a tool useful for Complexity Analysis, called Coh-Metrix-Esp.\
    \ This is the Spanish version of Coh-Metrix and is able to calculate 45 readability\
    \ indices. We analyse how these indices behave in a corpus of \u201Csimple\u201D\
    \ and \u201Ccomplex\u201D documents, and also use them as features in a complexity\
    \ binary classifier for texts in Spanish. After some experiments with machine\
    \ learning algorithms, we got 0.9 F-measure for a corpus that contains tales for\
    \ kids and adults and 0.82 F-measure for a corpus with texts written for students\
    \ of Spanish as a foreign language."
