  abstract: Machine reading using differentiable reasoning models has recently shown
    remarkable progress. In this context, End-to-End trainable Memory Networks (MemN2N)
    have demonstrated promising performance on simple natural language based reasoning
    tasks such as factual reasoning and basic deduction. However, other tasks, namely
    multi-fact question-answering, positional reasoning or dialog related tasks, remain
    challenging particularly due to the necessity of more complex interactions between
    the memory and controller modules composing this family of models. In this paper,
    we introduce a novel end-to-end memory access regulation mechanism inspired by
    the current progress on the connection short-cutting principle in the field of
    computer vision. Concretely, we develop a Gated End-to-End trainable Memory Network
    architecture (GMemN2N). From the machine learning perspective, this new capability
    is learned in an end-to-end fashion without the use of any additional supervision
    signal which is, as far as our knowledge goes, the first of its kind. Our experiments
    show significant improvements on the most challenging tasks in the 20 bAbI dataset,
    without the use of any domain knowledge. Then, we show improvements on the Dialog
    bAbI tasks including the real human-bot conversion-based Dialog State Tracking
    Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. On these two datasets, our model sets the new state
    of the art.

  abstract: 'Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process input text sequentially and
    model the conditional transition between word tokens. In contrast, the advantages
    of recursive networks include that they explicitly model the compositionality
    and the recursive structure of natural language. However, the current recursive
    architecture is limited by its dependence on syntactic tree. In this paper, we
    introduce a robust syntactic parsing-independent tree structured model, Neural
    Tree Indexers (NTI) that provides a middle ground between the sequential RNNs
    and the syntactic treebased recursive models. NTI constructs a full n-ary tree
    by processing the input text with its node function in a bottom-up fashion. Attention
    mechanism can then be applied to both structure and node function. We implemented
    and evaluated a binary tree model of NTI, showing the model achieved the state-of-the-art
    performance on three different NLP tasks: natural language inference, answer sentence
    selection, and sentence classification, outperforming state-of-the-art recurrent
    and recursive neural networks.'

  abstract: Neural networks with attention have proven effective for many natural
    language processing tasks. In this paper, we develop attention mechanisms for
    uncertainty detection. In particular, we generalize standardly used attention
    mechanisms by introducing external attention and sequence-preserving attention.
    These novel architectures differ from standard approaches in that they use external
    resources to compute attention weights and preserve sequence information. We compare
    them to other configurations along different dimensions of attention. Our novel
    architectures set the new state of the art on a Wikipedia benchmark dataset and
    perform similar to the state-of-the-art model on a biomedical benchmark which
    uses a large set of linguistic features.

    \ paper, we present and make publicly available a new dataset for Darknet active\
    \ domains, which we call \u201DDarknet Usage Text Addresses\u201D (DUTA). We built\
    \ DUTA by sampling the Tor network during two months and manually labeled each\

    \ text representation techniques crossed by three different supervised classifiers\
    \ to categorize the Tor hidden services. We also fixed the pipeline elements and\
    \ identified the aspects that have a critical influence on the classification\
    \ results. We found that the combination of TFIDF words representation with Logistic\
    \ Regression classifier achieves 96.6% of 10 folds cross-validation accuracy and\
    \ a macro F1 score of 93.7% when classifying a subset of illegal activities from\

  abstract: Word embeddings have been shown to be highly effective in a variety of
    lexical semantic tasks. They tend to capture meaningful relational similarities
    between individual words, at the expense of lacking the capabilty of making the
    underlying semantic relation explicit. In this paper, we investigate the attribute
    relation that often holds between the constituents of adjective-noun phrases.
    We use CBOW word embeddings to represent word meaning and learn a compositionality
    function that combines the individual constituents into a phrase representation,
    thus capturing the compositional attribute meaning. The resulting embedding model,
    while being fully interpretable, outperforms count-based distributional vector
    space models that are tailored to attribute meaning in the two tasks of attribute
    selection and phrase similarity prediction. Moreover, as the model captures a
    generalized layer of attribute meaning, it bears the potential to be used for
    predictions over various attribute inventories without re-training.

  abstract: The fundamental role of hypernymy in NLP has motivated the development
    of many methods for the automatic identification of this relation, most of which
    rely on word distribution. We investigate an extensive number of such unsupervised
    measures, using several distributional semantic models that differ by context
    type and feature weighting. We analyze the performance of the different methods
    based on their linguistic motivation. Comparison to the state-of-the-art supervised
    methods shows that while supervised methods generally outperform the unsupervised
    ones, the former are sensitive to the distribution of training instances, hurting
    their reliability. Being based on general linguistic hypotheses and independent
    from training data, unsupervised measures are more robust, and therefore are still
    useful artillery for hypernymy detection.

  abstract: Distinguishing between antonyms and synonyms is a key task to achieve
    high performance in NLP systems. While they are notoriously difficult to distinguish
    by distributional co-occurrence models, pattern-based methods have proven effective
    to differentiate between the relations. In this paper, we present a novel neural
    network model AntSynNET that exploits lexico-syntactic patterns from syntactic
    parse trees. In addition to the lexical and syntactic information, we successfully
    integrate the distance between the related words along the syntactic path as a
    new pattern feature. The results from classification experiments show that AntSynNET
    improves the performance over prior pattern-based methods.

  abstract: 'The current trend in NLP is the use of highly opaque models, e.g. neural
    networks and word embeddings. While these models yield state-of-the-art results
    on a range of tasks, their drawback is poor interpretability. On the example of
    word sense induction and disambiguation (WSID), we show that it is possible to
    develop an interpretable model that matches the state-of-the-art models in accuracy.
    Namely, we present an unsupervised, knowledge-free WSID approach, which is interpretable
    at three levels: word sense inventory, sense feature representations, and disambiguation
    procedure. Experiments show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art
    word sense embeddings and other unsupervised systems while offering the possibility
    to justify its decisions in human-readable form.'

  abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation is a long-standing task in Natural Language
    Processing, lying at the core of human language understanding. However, the evaluation
    of automatic systems has been problematic, mainly due to the lack of a reliable
    evaluation framework. In this paper we develop a unified evaluation framework
    and analyze the performance of various Word Sense Disambiguation systems in a
    fair setup. The results show that supervised systems clearly outperform knowledge-based
    models. Among the supervised systems, a linear classifier trained on conventional
    local features still proves to be a hard baseline to beat. Nonetheless, recent
    approaches exploiting neural networks on unlabeled corpora achieve promising results,
    surpassing this hard baseline in most test sets.

  abstract: We show that a neural approach to the task of non-factoid answer reranking
    can benefit from the inclusion of tried-and-tested handcrafted features. We present
    a neural network architecture based on a combination of recurrent neural networks
    that are used to encode questions and answers, and a multilayer perceptron. We
    show how this approach can be combined with additional features, in particular,
    the discourse features used by previous research. Our neural approach achieves
    state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset from Yahoo! Answers and its performance
    is further improved by incorporating the discourse features. Additionally, we
    present a new dataset of Ask Ubuntu questions where the hybrid approach also achieves
    good results.

  abstract: "Our goal is to combine the rich multi-step inference of symbolic logical\
    \ reasoning with the generalization capabilities of neural networks. We are particularly\
    \ interested in complex reasoning about entities and relations in text and large-scale\
    \ knowledge bases (KBs). Neelakantan et al. (2015) use RNNs to compose the distributed\
    \ semantics of multi-hop paths in KBs; however for multiple reasons, the approach\
    \ lacks accuracy and practicality. This paper proposes three significant modeling\
    \ advances: (1) we learn to jointly reason about relations, entities, and entity-types;\
    \ (2) we use neural attention\tmodeling to incorporate multiple paths; (3) we\
    \ learn to share strength in a single RNN that represents logical composition\
    \ across all\trelations. On a large-scale Freebase+ClueWeb prediction task, we\
    \ achieve 25%\terror reduction, and a 53% error reduction on sparse relations\
    \ due to shared\tstrength. On chains of reasoning in WordNet we reduce error in\
    \ mean quantile by\t84% versus previous state-of-the-art."

  abstract: 'Recognizing mentions of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in social media
    is challenging: ADR mentions are context-dependent and include long, varied and
    unconventional descriptions as compared to more formal medical symptom terminology.
    We use the CADEC corpus to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) transducer,
    integrated with knowledge graph embeddings of DBpedia, and show the resulting
    model to be highly accurate (93.4 F1). Furthermore, even when lacking high quality
    expert annotations, we show that by employing an active learning technique and
    using purpose built annotation tools, we can train the RNN to perform well (83.9
    F1).'

  abstract: "Language contains information about the author\u2019s demographic attributes\
    \ as well as their mental state, and has been successfully leveraged in NLP to\
    \ predict either one alone. However, demographic attributes and mental states\
    \ also interact with each other, and we are the first to demonstrate how to use\
    \ them jointly to improve the prediction of mental health conditions across the\
    \ board. We model the different conditions as tasks in a multitask learning (MTL)\
    \ framework, and establish for the first time the potential of deep learning in\
    \ the prediction of mental health from online user-generated text. The framework\
    \ we propose significantly improves over all baselines and single-task models\
    \ for predicting mental health conditions, with particularly significant gains\
    \ for conditions with limited data. In addition, our best MTL model can predict\
    \ the presence of conditions (neuroatypicality) more generally, further reducing\
    \ the error of the strong feed-forward baseline."

  abstract: Recent work on evaluating representation learning architectures in NLP
    has established a need for evaluation protocols based on subconscious cognitive
    measures rather than manually tailored intrinsic similarity and relatedness tasks.
    In this work, we propose a novel evaluation framework that enables large-scale
    evaluation of such architectures in the free word association (WA) task, which
    is firmly grounded in cognitive theories of human semantic representation. This
    evaluation is facilitated by the existence of large manually constructed repositories
    of word association data. In this paper, we (1) present a detailed analysis of
    the new quantitative WA evaluation protocol, (2) suggest new evaluation metrics
    for the WA task inspired by its direct analogy with information retrieval problems,
    (3) evaluate various state-of-the-art representation models on this task, and
    (4) discuss the relationship between WA and prior evaluations of semantic representation
    with well-known similarity and relatedness evaluation sets. We have made the WA
    evaluation toolkit publicly available.

  abstract: Research on computational argumentation faces the problem of how to automatically
    assess the quality of an argument or argumentation. While different quality dimensions
    have been approached in natural language processing, a common understanding of
    argumentation quality is still missing. This paper presents the first holistic
    work on computational argumentation quality in natural language. We comprehensively
    survey the diverse existing theories and approaches to assess logical, rhetorical,
    and dialectical quality dimensions, and we derive a systematic taxonomy from these.
    In addition, we provide a corpus with 320 arguments, annotated for all 15 dimensions
    in the taxonomy. Our results establish a common ground for research on computational
    argumentation quality assessment.

  abstract: This paper proposes a generic method for the comparative evaluation of
    system outputs. The approach is able to quantify the pairwise differences between
    two outputs and to unravel in detail what the differences consist of. We apply
    our approach to three tasks in Computational Linguistics, i.e. POS tagging, dependency
    parsing, and coreference resolution. We find that system outputs are more distinct
    than the (often) small differences in evaluation scores seem to suggest.

  abstract: Machine translation (MT) quality is evaluated through comparisons between
    MT outputs and the human translations (HT). Traditionally, this evaluation relies
    on form related features (e.g. lexicon and syntax) and ignores the transfer of
    meaning reflected in HT outputs. Instead, we evaluate the quality of MT outputs
    through meaning related features (e.g. polarity, subjectivity) with two experiments.
    In the first experiment, the meaning related features are compared to human rankings
    individually. In the second experiment, combinations of meaning related features
    and other quality metrics are utilized to predict the same human rankings. The
    results of our experiments confirm the benefit of these features in predicting
    human evaluation of translation quality in addition to traditional metrics which
    focus mainly on form.

  abstract: In cross-lingual dependency annotation projection, information is often
    lost during transfer because of early decoding. We present an end-to-end graph-based
    neural network dependency parser that can be trained to reproduce matrices of
    edge scores, which can be directly projected across word alignments. We show that
    our approach to cross-lingual dependency parsing is not only simpler, but also
    achieves an absolute improvement of 2.25% averaged across 10 languages compared
    to the previous state of the art.

    (UD). Our algorithm is based on PageRank and a small set of specific dependency
    head rules. UDP features two-step decoding to guarantee that function words are
    attached as leaf nodes. The parser requires no training, and it is competitive
    with a delexicalized transfer system. UDP offers a linguistically sound unsupervised
    alternative to cross-lingual parsing for UD. The parser has very few parameters
    and distinctly robust to domain change across languages.

  abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the problem of cross-lingual dependency
    parsing, aiming at leveraging training data from different source languages to
    learn a parser in a target language. Specifically, this approach first constructs
    word vector representations that exploit structural (i.e., dependency-based) contexts
    but only considering the morpho-syntactic information associated with each word
    and its contexts. These delexicalized word embeddings, which can be trained on
    any set of languages and capture features shared across languages, are then used
    in combination with standard language-specific features to train a lexicalized
    parser in the target language. We evaluate our approach through experiments on
    a set of eight different languages that are part the Universal Dependencies Project.
    Our main results show that using such delexicalized embeddings, either trained
    in a monolingual or multilingual fashion, achieves significant improvements over
    monolingual baselines.

  abstract: 'Recent work has addressed the problem of detecting relevant claims for
    a given controversial topic. We introduce the complementary task of Claim Stance
    Classification, along with the first benchmark dataset for this task. We decompose
    this problem into: (a) open-domain target identification for topic and claim (b)
    sentiment classification for each target, and (c) open-domain contrast detection
    between the topic and the claim targets. Manual annotation of the dataset confirms
    the applicability and validity of our model. We describe an implementation of
    our model, focusing on a novel algorithm for contrast detection. Our approach
    achieves promising results, and is shown to outperform several baselines, which
    represent the common practice of applying a single, monolithic classifier for
    stance classification.'

  abstract: Sentiment Analysis is a broad task that involves the analysis of various
    aspect of the natural language text. However, most of the approaches in the state
    of the art usually investigate independently each aspect, i.e. Subjectivity Classification,
    Sentiment Polarity Classification, Emotion Recognition, Irony Detection. In this
    paper we present a Multi-View Sentiment Corpus (MVSC), which comprises 3000 English
    microblog posts related the movie domain. Three independent annotators manually
    labelled MVSC, following a broad annotation schema about different aspects that
    can be grasped from natural language text coming from social networks. The contribution
    is therefore a corpus that comprises five different views for each message, i.e.
    subjective/objective, sentiment polarity, implicit/explicit, irony, emotion. In
    order to allow a more detailed investigation on the human labelling behaviour,
    we provide the annotations of each human annotator involved.

  abstract: Inferring implicit discourse relations in natural language text is the
    most difficult subtask in discourse parsing. Many neural network models have been
    proposed to tackle this problem. However, the comparison for this task is not
    unified, so we could hardly draw clear conclusions about the effectiveness of
    various architectures. Here, we propose neural network models that are based on
    feedforward and long-short term memory architecture and systematically study the
    effects of varying structures. To our surprise, the best-configured feedforward
    architecture outperforms LSTM-based model in most cases despite thorough tuning.
    Further, we compare our best feedforward system with competitive convolutional
    and recurrent networks and find that feedforward can actually be more effective.
    For the first time for this task, we compile and publish outputs from previous
    neural and non-neural systems to establish the standard for further comparison.

  abstract: Discourse parsing is an integral part of understanding information flow
    and argumentative structure in documents. Most previous research has focused on
    inducing and evaluating models from the English RST Discourse Treebank. However,
    discourse treebanks for other languages exist, including Spanish, German, Basque,
    Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The treebanks share the same underlying linguistic
    theory, but differ slightly in the way documents are annotated. In this paper,
    we present (a) a new discourse parser which is simpler, yet competitive (significantly
    better on 2/3 metrics) to state of the art for English, (b) a harmonization of
    discourse treebanks across languages, enabling us to present (c) what to the best
    of our knowledge are the first experiments on cross-lingual discourse parsing.

  abstract: In an end-to-end dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to
    accurately estimate a compact representation of the current dialog status from
    a sequence of noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the natural
    language understanding modules. This paper introduces a novel method of dialog
    state tracking based on the general paradigm of machine reading and proposes to
    solve it using an End-to-End Memory Network, MemN2N, a memory-enhanced neural
    network architecture. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dialog State
    Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. The corpus has been converted for the occasion
    in order to frame the hidden state variable inference as a question-answering
    task based on a sequence of utterances extracted from a dialog. We show that the
    proposed tracker gives encouraging results. Then, we propose to extend the DSTC-2
    dataset with specific reasoning capabilities requirement like counting, list maintenance,
    yes-no question answering and indefinite knowledge management. Finally, we present
    encouraging results using our proposed MemN2N based tracking model.

  abstract: Automated discourse analysis tools based on Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) aiming at the diagnosis of language-impairing dementias generally extract
    several textual metrics of narrative transcripts. However, the absence of sentence
    boundary segmentation in the transcripts prevents the direct application of NLP
    methods which rely on these marks in order to function properly, such as taggers
    and parsers. We present the first steps taken towards automatic neuropsychological
    evaluation based on narrative discourse analysis, presenting a new automatic sentence
    segmentation method for impaired speech. Our model uses recurrent convolutional
    neural networks with prosodic, Part of Speech (PoS) features, and word embeddings.
    It was evaluated intrinsically on impaired, spontaneous speech as well as normal,
    prepared speech and presents better results for healthy elderly (CTL) (F1 = 0.74)
    and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients (F1 = 0.70) than the Conditional
    Random Fields method (F1 = 0.55 and 0.53, respectively) used in the same context
    of our study. The results suggest that our model is robust for impaired speech
    and can be used in automated discourse analysis tools to differentiate narratives
    produced by MCI and CTL.

  abstract: 'A major motivation for unsupervised morphological analysis is to reduce
    the sparse data problem in under-resourced languages. Most previous work focus
    on segmenting surface forms into their constituent morphs (taking: tak +ing),
    but surface form segmentation does not solve the sparse data problem as the analyses
    of take and taking are not connected to each other. We present a system that adapts
    the MorphoChains system (Narasimhan et al., 2015) to provide morphological analyses
    that aim to abstract over spelling differences in functionally similar morphs.
    This results in analyses that are not compelled to use all the orthographic material
    of a word (stopping: stop +ing) or limited to only that material (acidified: acid
    +ify +ed). On average across six typologically varied languages our system has
    a similar or better F-score on EMMA (a measure of underlying morpheme accuracy)
    than three strong baselines; moreover, the total number of distinct morphemes
    identified by our system is on average 12.8% lower than for Morfessor (Virpioja
    et al., 2013), a state-of-the-art surface segmentation system.'

    on homogeneous datasets but their performance suffers on datasets containing data
    from different genres. In our current work, we investigate how to create POS tagging
    and dependency parsing experts for heterogeneous data by employing topic modeling.
    We create topic models (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to determine genres
    from a heterogeneous dataset and then train an expert for each of the genres.
    Our results show that the topic modeling experts reach substantial improvements
    when compared to the general versions. For dependency parsing, the improvement
    reaches 2 percent points over the full training baseline when we use two topics.

  abstract: In this paper, we present how the principles of universal dependencies
    and morphology have been adapted to Hungarian. We report the most challenging
    grammatical phenomena and our solutions to those. On the basis of the adapted
    guidelines, we have converted and manually corrected 1,800 sentences from the
    Szeged Treebank to universal dependency format. We also introduce experiments
    on this manually annotated corpus for evaluating automatic conversion and the
    added value of language-specific, i.e. non-universal, annotations. Our results
    reveal that converting to universal dependencies is not necessarily trivial, moreover,
    using language-specific morphological features may have an impact on overall performance.

  abstract: Neural attention models have achieved great success in different NLP tasks.
    However, they have not fulfilled their promise on the AMR parsing task due to
    the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we describe a sequence-to-sequence model
    for AMR parsing and present different ways to tackle the data sparsity problem.
    We show that our methods achieve significant improvement over a baseline neural
    attention model and our results are also competitive against state-of-the-art
    systems that do not use extra linguistic resources.

  abstract: In recent years, knowledge graphs such as Freebase that capture facts
    about entities and relationships between them have been used actively for answering
    factoid questions. In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically generating
    question answer pairs from a given knowledge graph. The generated question answer
    (QA) pairs can be used in several downstream applications. For example, they could
    be used for training better QA systems. To generate such QA pairs, we first extract
    a set of keywords from entities and relationships expressed in a triple stored
    in the knowledge graph. From each such set, we use a subset of keywords to generate
    a natural language question that has a unique answer. We treat this subset of
    keywords as a sequence and propose a sequence to sequence model using RNN to generate
    a natural language question from it. Our RNN based model generates QA pairs with
    an accuracy of 33.61 percent and performs 110.47 percent (relative) better than
    a state-of-the-art template based method for generating natural language question
    from keywords. We also do an extrinsic evaluation by using the generated QA pairs
    to train a QA system and observe that the F1-score of the QA system improves by
    5.5 percent (relative) when using automatically generated QA pairs in addition
    to manually generated QA pairs available for training.

  abstract: 'To analyze the limitations and the future directions of the extractive
    summarization paradigm, this paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
    formulation to obtain extractive oracle summaries in terms of ROUGE-N. We also
    propose an algorithm that enumerates all of the oracle summaries for a set of
    reference summaries to exploit F-measures that evaluate which system summaries
    contain how many sentences that are extracted as an oracle summary. Our experimental
    results obtained from Document Understanding Conference (DUC) corpora demonstrated
    the following: (1) room still exists to improve the performance of extractive
    summarization; (2) the F-measures derived from the enumerated oracle summaries
    have significantly stronger correlations with human judgment than those derived
    from single oracle summaries.'

  abstract: 'We present a memory augmented neural network for natural language understanding:
    Neural Semantic Encoders. NSE is equipped with a novel memory update rule and
    has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and maintains the

    can also access 1 multiple and shared memories. In this paper, we demonstrated
    the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different natural language
    tasks: natural language inference, question answering, sentence classification,
    document sentiment analysis and machine translation where NSE achieved state-of-the-art
    performance when evaluated on publically available benchmarks. For example, our
    shared-memory model showed an encouraging result on neural machine translation,

  abstract: Comparing NLP systems to select the best one for a task of interest, such
    as named entity recognition, is critical for practitioners and researchers. A
    rigorous approach involves setting up a hypothesis testing scenario using the
    performance of the systems on query documents. However, often the hypothesis testing
    approach needs to send a lot of document queries to the systems, which can be
    problematic. In this paper, we present an effective alternative based on the multi-armed
    bandit (MAB). We propose a hierarchical generative model to represent the uncertainty
    in the performance measures of the competing systems, to be used by Thompson Sampling
    to solve the resulting MAB. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data
    show that our approach requires significantly fewer queries compared to the standard
    benchmarking technique to identify the best system according to F-measure.

  abstract: We present a Character-Word Long Short-Term Memory Language Model which
    both reduces the perplexity with respect to a baseline word-level language model
    and reduces the number of parameters of the model. Character information can reveal
    structural (dis)similarities between words and can even be used when a word is
    out-of-vocabulary, thus improving the modeling of infrequent and unknown words.
    By concatenating word and character embeddings, we achieve up to 2.77% relative
    improvement on English compared to a baseline model with a similar amount of parameters
    and 4.57% on Dutch. Moreover, we also outperform baseline word-level models with
    a larger number of parameters.

  abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for learning
    sequences of Dialogue Acts (DAs). The input in this task is a sequence of utterances
    (i.e., conversational contributions) comprising a sequence of tokens, and the
    output is a sequence of DA labels (one label per utterance). Our model leverages
    the hierarchical nature of dialogue data by using two nested RNNs that capture
    long-range dependencies at the dialogue level and the utterance level. This model
    is combined with an attention mechanism that focuses on salient tokens in utterances.
    Our experimental results show that our model outperforms strong baselines on two
    popular datasets, Switchboard and MapTask; and our detailed empirical analysis
    highlights the impact of each aspect of our model.

  abstract: Teaching machines to accomplish tasks by conversing naturally with humans
    is challenging. Currently, developing task-oriented dialogue systems requires
    creating multiple components and typically this involves either a large amount
    of handcrafting, or acquiring costly labelled datasets to solve a statistical
    learning problem for each component. In this work we introduce a neural network-based
    text-in, text-out end-to-end trainable goal-oriented dialogue system along with
    a new way of collecting dialogue data based on a novel pipe-lined Wizard-of-Oz
    framework. This approach allows us to develop dialogue systems easily and without
    making too many assumptions about the task at hand. The results show that the
    model can converse with human subjects naturally whilst helping them to accomplish
    tasks in a restaurant search domain.

  abstract: 'In this paper we tackle a unique and important problem of extracting
    a structured order from the conversation a customer has with an order taker at
    a restaurant. This is motivated by an actual system under development to assist
    in the order taking process. We develop a sequence-to-sequence model that is able
    to map from unstructured conversational input to the structured form that is conveyed
    to the kitchen and appears on the customer receipt. This problem is critically
    different from other tasks like machine translation where sequence-to-sequence
    models have been used: the input includes two sides of a conversation; the output
    is highly structured; and logical manipulations must be performed, for example
    when the customer changes his mind while ordering. We present a novel sequence-to-sequence
    model that incorporates a special attention-memory gating mechanism and conversational
    role markers. The proposed model improves performance over both a phrase-based
    machine translation approach and a standard sequence-to-sequence model.'

  abstract: 'We present a deterministic sieve-based system for attributing quotations
    in literary text and a new dataset: QuoteLi3. Quote attribution, determining who
    said what in a given text, is important for tasks like creating dialogue systems,
    and in newer areas like computational literary studies, where it creates opportunities
    to analyze novels at scale rather than only a few at a time. We release QuoteLi3,
    which contains more than 6,000 annotations linking quotes to speaker mentions
    and quotes to speaker entities, and introduce a new algorithm for quote attribution.
    Our two-stage algorithm first links quotes to mentions, then mentions to entities.
    Using two stages encapsulates difficult sub-problems and improves system performance.
    The modular design allows us to tune for overall performance or higher precision,
    which is useful for many real-world use cases. Our system achieves an average
    F-score of 87.5 across three novels, outperforming previous systems, and can be
    tuned for precision of 90.4 at a recall of 65.1.'

  abstract: Domain dependence of NLP systems is one of the major obstacles to their
    application in large-scale text analysis, also restricting the applicability of
    FrameNet semantic role labeling (SRL) systems. Yet, current FrameNet SRL systems
    are still only evaluated on a single in-domain test set. For the first time, we
    study the domain dependence of FrameNet SRL on a wide range of benchmark sets.
    We create a novel test set for FrameNet SRL based on user-generated web text and
    find that the major bottleneck for out-of-domain FrameNet SRL is the frame identification
    step. To address this problem, we develop a simple, yet efficient system based
    on distributed word representations. Our system closely approaches the state-of-the-art
    in-domain while outperforming the best available frame identification system out-of-domain.
    We publish our system and test data for research purposes.

  abstract: Existing target-specific sentiment recognition methods consider only a
    single target per tweet, and have been shown to miss nearly half of the actual
    targets mentioned. We present a corpus of UK election tweets, with an average
    of 3.09 entities per tweet and more than one type of sentiment in half of the
    tweets. This requires a method for multi-target specific sentiment recognition,
    which we develop by using the context around a target as well as syntactic dependencies
    involving the target. We present results of our method on both a benchmark corpus
    of single targets and the multi-target election corpus, showing state-of-the art
    performance in both corpora and outperforming previous approaches to multi-target
    sentiment task as well as deep learning models for single-target sentiment.

  abstract: We propose a new evaluation for automatic solvers for algebra word problems,
    which can identify mistakes that existing evaluations overlook. Our proposal is
    to evaluate such solvers using derivations, which reflect how an equation system
    was constructed from the word problem. To accomplish this, we develop an algorithm
    for checking the equivalence between two derivations, and show how derivation
    annotations can be semi-automatically added to existing datasets. To make our
    experiments more comprehensive, we include the derivation annotation for DRAW-1K,
    a new dataset containing 1000 general algebra word problems. In our experiments,
    we found that the annotated derivations enable a more accurate evaluation of automatic
    solvers than previously used metrics. We release derivation annotations for over
    2300 algebra word problems for future evaluations.

  abstract: This paper investigates neural character-based morphological tagging for
    languages with complex morphology and large tag sets. Character-based approaches
    are attractive as they can handle rarely- and unseen words gracefully. We evaluate
    on 14 languages and observe consistent gains over a state-of-the-art morphological
    tagger across all languages except for English and French, where we match the
    state-of-the-art. We compare two architectures for computing character-based word
    vectors using recurrent (RNN) and convolutional (CNN) nets. We show that the CNN
    based approach performs slightly worse and less consistently than the RNN based
    approach. Small but systematic gains are observed when combining the two architectures
    by ensembling.

  abstract: We explore the task of multi-source morphological reinflection, which
    generalizes the standard, single-source version. The input consists of (i) a target
    tag and (ii) multiple pairs of source form and source tag for a lemma. The motivation
    is that it is beneficial to have access to more than one source form since different
    source forms can provide complementary information, e.g., different stems. We
    further present a novel extension to the encoder-decoder recurrent neural architecture,
    consisting of multiple encoders, to better solve the task. We show that our new
    architecture outperforms single-source reinflection models and publish our dataset
    for multi-source morphological reinflection to facilitate future research.

  abstract: 'Automatic post-editing (APE) for machine translation (MT) aims to fix
    recurrent errors made by the MT decoder by learning from correction examples.
    In controlled evaluation scenarios, the representativeness of the training set
    with respect to the test data is a key factor to achieve good performance. Real-life
    scenarios, however, do not guarantee such favorable learning conditions. Ideally,
    to be integrated in a real professional translation workflow (e.g. to play a role
    in computer-assisted translation framework), APE tools should be flexible enough
    to cope with continuous streams of diverse data coming from different domains/genres.
    To cope with this problem, we propose an online APE framework that is: i) robust
    to data diversity (i.e. capable to learn and apply correction rules in the right
    contexts) and ii) able to evolve over time (by continuously extending and refining
    its knowledge). In a comparative evaluation, with English-German test data coming
    in random order from two different domains, we show the effectiveness of our approach,
    which outperforms a strong batch system and the state of the art in online APE.'

  abstract: Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic representation for
    natural language that embeds annotations related to traditional tasks such as
    named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation and
    co-reference resolution. We describe a transition-based parser for AMR that parses
    sentences left-to-right, in linear time. We further propose a test-suite that
    assesses specific subtasks that are helpful in comparing AMR parsers, and show
    that our parser is competitive with the state of the art on the LDC2015E86 dataset
    and that it outperforms state-of-the-art parsers for recovering named entities
    and handling polarity.

  abstract: Natural language understanding and dialog management are two integral
    components of interactive dialog systems. Previous research has used machine learning
    techniques to individually optimize these components, with different forms of
    direct and indirect supervision. We present an approach to integrate the learning
    of both a dialog strategy using reinforcement learning, and a semantic parser
    for robust natural language understanding, using only natural dialog interaction
    for supervision. Experimental results on a simulated task of robot instruction
    demonstrate that joint learning of both components improves dialog performance
    over learning either of these components alone.

  abstract: This paper presents a method for applying automatically acquired knowledge
    to semantic role labeling (SRL). We use a large amount of automatically extracted
    knowledge to improve the performance of SRL. We present two varieties of knowledge,
    which we call surface case frames and deep case frames. Although the surface case
    frames are compiled from syntactic parses and can be used as rich syntactic knowledge,
    they have limited capability for resolving semantic ambiguity. To compensate the
    deficiency of the surface case frames, we compile deep case frames from automatic
    semantic roles. We also consider quality management for both types of knowledge
    in order to get rid of the noise brought from the automatic analyses. The experimental
    results show that Chinese SRL can be improved using automatically acquired knowledge
    and the quality management shows a positive effect on this task.

  abstract: 'Entities are essential elements of natural language. In this paper, we
    present methods for learning multi-level representations of entities on three
    complementary levels: character (character patterns in entity names extracted,
    e.g., by neural networks), word (embeddings of words in entity names) and entity
    (entity embeddings). We investigate state-of-the-art learning methods on each
    level and find large differences, e.g., for deep learning models, traditional
    ngram features and the subword model of fasttext (Bojanowski et al., 2016) on
    the character level; for word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the word level; and
    for the order-aware model wang2vec (Ling et al., 2015a) on the entity level. We
    confirm experimentally that each level of representation contributes complementary
    information and a joint representation of all three levels improves the existing
    embedding based baseline for fine-grained entity typing by a large margin. Additionally,
    we show that adding information from entity descriptions further improves multi-level
    representations of entities.'

  abstract: In this paper, we present ContrastMedium, an algorithm that transforms
    noisy semantic networks into full-fledged, clean taxonomies. ContrastMedium is
    able to identify the embedded taxonomy structure from a noisy knowledge graph
    without explicit human supervision such as, for instance, a set of manually selected
    input root and leaf concepts. This is achieved by leveraging structural information
    from a companion reference taxonomy, to which the input knowledge graph is linked
    (either automatically or manually). When used in conjunction with methods for
    hypernym acquisition and knowledge base linking, our methodology provides a complete
    solution for end-to-end taxonomy induction. We conduct experiments using automatically
    acquired knowledge graphs, as well as a SemEval benchmark, and show that our method
    is able to achieve high performance on the task of taxonomy induction.

  abstract: Building knowledge bases (KB) automatically from text corpora is crucial
    for many applications such as question answering and web search. The problem is
    very challenging and has been divided into sub-problems such as mention and named
    entity recognition, entity linking and relation extraction. However, combining
    these components has shown to be under-constrained and often produces KBs with
    supersize entities and common-sense errors in relations (a person has multiple
    birthdates). The errors are difficult to resolve solely with IE tools but become
    obvious with world knowledge at the corpus level. By analyzing Freebase and a
    large text collection, we found that per-relation cardinality and the popularity
    of entities follow the power-law distribution favoring flat long tails with low-frequency
    instances. We present a probabilistic joint inference algorithm to incorporate
    this world knowledge during KB construction. Our approach yields state-of-the-art
    performance on the TAC Cold Start task, and 42% and 19.4% relative improvements
    in F1 over our baseline on Cold Start hop-1 and all-hop queries respectively.

  abstract: "Universal schema predicts the types of entities and relations in a knowledge\
    \ base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types\u2014\
    not only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia\
    \ infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text. This\
    \ prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one type\
    \ per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity types\
    \ or binary relation types, respectively). Factorizing this sparsely observed\
    \ matrix yields a learned vector embedding for each row and each column. In this\
    \ paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or entity-pairs\
    \ unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row embedding). We\
    \ propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a\
    \ row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of\
    \ the observed columns for that row. We experiment with various aggregation functions,\
    \ including neural network attention models. Our approach can be understood as\
    \ a natural language database, in that questions about KB entities are answered\
    \ by attending to textual or database evidence. In experiments predicting both\
    \ relations and entity types, we demonstrate that despite having an order of magnitude\
    \ fewer parameters than traditional universal schema, we can match the accuracy\
    \ of the traditional model, and more importantly, we can now make predictions\
    \ about unseen rows with nearly the same accuracy as rows available at training\
    \ time."

  abstract: Automatically generating product reviews is a meaningful, yet not well-studied
    task in sentiment analysis. Traditional natural language generation methods rely
    extensively on hand-crafted rules and predefined templates. This paper presents
    an attention-enhanced attribute-to-sequence model to generate product reviews
    for given attribute information, such as user, product, and rating. The attribute
    encoder learns to represent input attributes as vectors. Then, the sequence decoder
    generates reviews by conditioning its output on these vectors. We also introduce
    an attention mechanism to jointly generate reviews and align words with input
    attributes. The proposed model is trained end-to-end to maximize the likelihood
    of target product reviews given the attributes. We build a publicly available
    dataset for the review generation task by leveraging the Amazon book reviews and
    their metadata. Experiments on the dataset show that our approach outperforms
    baseline methods and the attention mechanism significantly improves the performance
    of our model.

  abstract: We investigate the generation of one-sentence Wikipedia biographies from
    facts derived from Wikidata slot-value pairs. We train a recurrent neural network
    sequence-to-sequence model with attention to select facts and generate textual
    summaries. Our model incorporates a novel secondary objective that helps ensure
    it generates sentences that contain the input facts. The model achieves a BLEU
    score of 41, improving significantly upon the vanilla sequence-to-sequence model
    and scoring roughly twice that of a simple template baseline. Human preference
    evaluation suggests the model is nearly as good as the Wikipedia reference. Manual
    analysis explores content selection, suggesting the model can trade the ability
    to infer knowledge against the risk of hallucinating incorrect information.

  abstract: Traditional methods for deep NLG adopt pipeline approaches comprising
    stages such as constructing syntactic input, predicting function words, linearizing
    the syntactic input and generating the surface forms. Though easier to visualize,
    pipeline approaches suffer from error propagation. In addition, information available
    across modules cannot be leveraged by all modules. We construct a transition-based
    model to jointly perform linearization, function word prediction and morphological
    generation, which considerably improves upon the accuracy compared to a pipelined
    baseline system. On a standard deep input linearization shared task, our system
    achieves the best results reported so far.

  abstract: This study introduces a statistical model able to generate variations
    of a proper name by taking into account the person to be mentioned, the discourse
    context and variation. The model relies on the REGnames corpus, a dataset with
    53,102 proper name references to 1,000 people in different discourse contexts.
    We evaluate the versions of our model from the perspective of how human writers
    produce proper names, and also how human readers process them. The corpus and
    the model are publicly available.

  abstract: Error propagation is a common problem in NLP. Reinforcement learning explores
    erroneous states during training and can therefore be more robust when mistakes
    are made early in a process. In this paper, we apply reinforcement learning to
    greedy dependency parsing which is known to suffer from error propagation. Reinforcement
    learning improves accuracy of both labeled and unlabeled dependencies of the Stanford
    Neural Dependency Parser, a high performance greedy parser, while maintaining
    its efficiency. We investigate the portion of errors which are the result of error
    propagation and confirm that reinforcement learning reduces the occurrence of
    error propagation.

  abstract: We use the noisy-channel theory of human sentence comprehension to develop
    an incremental processing cost model that unifies and extends key features of
    expectation-based and memory-based models. In this model, which we call noisy-context
    surprisal, the processing cost of a word is the surprisal of the word given a
    noisy representation of the preceding context. We show that this model accounts
    for an outstanding puzzle in sentence comprehension, language-dependent structural
    forgetting effects (Gibson and Thomas, 1999; Vasishth et al., 2010; Frank et al.,
    2016), which are previously not well modeled by either expectation-based or memory-based
    approaches. Additionally, we show that this model derives and generalizes locality
    effects (Gibson, 1998; Demberg and Keller, 2008), a signature prediction of memory-based
    models. We give corpus-based evidence for a key assumption in this derivation.

  abstract: "This work studies comparatively two typical sentence matching tasks:\
    \ textual entailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that weaker phrase\
    \ alignments are more critical in TE, while stronger phrase alignments deserve\
    \ more attention in AS. The key to reach this observation lies in phrase detection,\
    \ phrase representation, phrase alignment, and more importantly how to connect\
    \ those aligned phrases of different matching degrees with the final classifier.\
    \ Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase generation and representation, or (ii)\
    \ conducts alignment at word and phrase levels by handcrafted features or (iii)\
    \ utilizes a single framework of alignment without considering the characteristics\
    \ of specific tasks, which limits the framework\u2019s effectiveness across tasks.\
    \ We propose an architecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit that supports (i) representation\
    \ learning of phrases of arbitrary granularity and (ii) task-specific attentive\
    \ pooling of phrase alignments between two sentences. Experimental results on\
    \ TE and AS match our observation and show the effectiveness of our approach."

  abstract: We approach the recognition of textual entailment using logical semantic
    representations and a theorem prover. In this setup, lexical divergences that
    preserve semantic entailment between the source and target texts need to be explicitly
    stated. However, recognising subsentential semantic relations is not trivial.
    We address this problem by monitoring the proof of the theorem and detecting unprovable
    sub-goals that share predicate arguments with logical premises. If a linguistic
    relation exists, then an appropriate axiom is constructed on-demand and the theorem
    proving continues. Experiments show that this approach is effective and precise,
    producing a system that outperforms other logic-based systems and is competitive
    with state-of-the-art statistical methods.

  abstract: We propose a framework that captures the denotational probabilities of
    words and phrases by embedding them in a vector space, and present a method to
    induce such an embedding from a dataset of denotational probabilities. We show
    that our model successfully predicts denotational probabilities for unseen phrases,
    and that its predictions are useful for textual entailment datasets such as SICK
    and SNLI.

  abstract: Americans spend about a third of their time online, with many participating
    in online conversations on social and political issues. We hypothesize that social
    media arguments on such issues may be more engaging and persuasive than traditional
    media summaries, and that particular types of people may be more or less convinced
    by particular styles of argument, e.g. emotional arguments may resonate with some
    personalities while factual arguments resonate with others. We report a set of
    experiments testing at large scale how audience variables interact with argument
    style to affect the persuasiveness of an argument, an under-researched topic within
    natural language processing. We show that belief change is affected by personality
    factors, with conscientious, open and agreeable people being more convinced by
    emotional arguments.

  abstract: While cross-lingual word embeddings have been studied extensively in recent
    years, the qualitative differences between the different algorithms remain vague.
    We observe that whether or not an algorithm uses a particular feature set (sentence
    IDs) accounts for a significant performance gap among these algorithms. This feature
    set is also used by traditional alignment algorithms, such as IBM Model-1, which
    demonstrate similar performance to state-of-the-art embedding algorithms on a
    variety of benchmarks. Overall, we observe that different algorithmic approaches
    for utilizing the sentence ID feature space result in similar performance. This
    paper draws both empirical and theoretical parallels between the embedding and
    alignment literature, and suggests that adding additional sources of information,
    which go beyond the traditional signal of bilingual sentence-aligned corpora,
    may substantially improve cross-lingual word embeddings, and that future baselines
    should at least take such features into account.

  abstract: This paper presents a new, efficient method for learning task-specific
    word vectors using a variant of the Passive-Aggressive algorithm. Specifically,
    this algorithm learns a word embedding matrix in tandem with the classifier parameters
    in an online fashion, solving a bi-convex constrained optimization at each iteration.
    We provide a theoretical analysis of this new algorithm in terms of regret bounds,
    and evaluate it on both synthetic data and NLP classification problems, including
    text classification and sentiment analysis. In the latter case, we compare various
    pre-trained word vectors to initialize our word embedding matrix, and show that
    the matrix learned by our algorithm vastly outperforms the initial matrix, with
    performance results comparable or above the state-of-the-art on these tasks.

  abstract: We introduce the first generic text representation model that is completely
    nonsymbolic, i.e., it does not require the availability of a segmentation or tokenization
    method that attempts to identify words or other symbolic units in text. This applies
    to training the parameters of the model on a training corpus as well as to applying
    it when computing the representation of a new text. We show that our model performs
    better than prior work on an information extraction and a text denoising task.

  abstract: 'Fine-grained entity type classification (FETC) is the task of classifying
    an entity mention to a broad set of types. Distant supervision paradigm is extensively
    used to generate training data for this task. However, generated training data
    assigns same set of labels to every mention of an entity without considering its
    local context. Existing FETC systems have two major drawbacks: assuming training
    data to be noise free and use of hand crafted features. Our work overcomes both
    drawbacks. We propose a neural network model that jointly learns entity mentions
    and their context representation to eliminate use of hand crafted features. Our
    model treats training data as noisy and uses non-parametric variant of hinge loss
    function. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
    methods on two publicly available datasets, namely FIGER (GOLD) and BBN with an
    average relative improvement of 2.69% in micro-F1 score. Knowledge learnt by our
    model on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets while using same model
    or other FETC systems. These approaches of transferring knowledge further improve
    the performance of respective models.'

  abstract: "To extract structured representations of newsworthy events from Twitter,\
    \ unsupervised models typically assume that tweets involving the same named entities\
    \ and expressed using similar words are likely to belong to the same event. Hence,\
    \ they group tweets into clusters based on the co-occurrence patterns of named\
    \ entities and topical keywords. However, there are two main limitations. First,\
    \ they require the number of events to be known beforehand, which is not realistic\
    \ in practical applications. Second, they don\u2019t recognise that the same named\
    \ entity might be referred to by multiple mentions and tweets using different\
    \ mentions would be wrongly assigned to different events. To overcome these limitations,\
    \ we propose a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with word embeddings for\
    \ event extraction, in which the number of events can be inferred automatically\
    \ and the issue of lexical variations for the same named entity can be dealt with\
    \ properly. Our model has been evaluated on three datasets with sizes ranging\
    \ between 2,499 and over 60 million tweets. Experimental results show that our\
    \ model outperforms the baseline approach on all datasets by 5-8% in F-measure."

    \ mentions, entity types of these mentions and appropriate semantic relation for\
    \ each pair of mentions. Traditionally, separate predictive models were trained\
    \ for each of these tasks and were used in a \u201Cpipeline\u201D fashion where\
    \ output of one model is fed as input to another. But it was observed that addressing\
    \ some of these tasks jointly results in better performance. We propose a single,\
    \ joint neural network based model to carry out all the three tasks of boundary\
    \ identification, entity type classification and relation type classification.\
    \ This model is referred to as \u201CAll Word Pairs\u201D model (AWP-NN) as it\
    \ assigns an appropriate label to each word pair in a given sentence for performing\
    \ end-to-end relation extraction. We also propose to refine output of the AWP-NN\
    \ model by using inference in Markov Logic Networks (MLN) so that additional domain\
    \ knowledge can be effectively incorporated. We demonstrate effectiveness of our\
    \ approach by achieving better end-to-end relation extraction performance than\
    \ all 4 previous joint modelling approaches, on the standard dataset of ACE 2004."

  abstract: "We introduce automatic verification as a post-processing step for entity\
    \ linking (EL). The proposed method trusts EL system results collectively, by\
    \ assuming entity mentions are mostly linked correctly, in order to create a semantic\
    \ profile of the given text using geospatial and temporal information, as well\
    \ as fine-grained entity types. This profile is then used to automatically verify\
    \ each linked mention individually, i.e., to predict whether it has been linked\
    \ correctly or not. Verification allows leveraging a rich set of global and pairwise\
    \ features that would be prohibitively expensive for EL systems employing global\
    \ inference. Evaluation shows consistent improvements across datasets and systems.\
    \ In particular, when applied to state-of-the-art systems, our method yields an\
    \ absolute improvement in linking performance of up to 1.7 F1 on AIDA/CoNLL\u2019\
    03 and up to 2.4 F1 on the English TAC KBP 2015 TEDL dataset."

  abstract: "Enabling machines to read and comprehend unstructured text remains an\
    \ unfulfilled goal for NLP research. Recent research efforts on the \u201Cmachine\
    \ comprehension\u201D task have managed to achieve close to ideal performance\
    \ on simulated data. However, achieving similar levels of performance on small\
    \ real world datasets has proved difficult; major challenges stem from the large\
    \ vocabulary size, complex grammar, and, the frequent ambiguities in linguistic\
    \ structure. On the other hand, the requirement of human generated annotations\
    \ for training, in order to ensure a sufficiently diverse set of questions is\
    \ prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these practical issues, we propose a novel\
    \ curriculum inspired training procedure for Memory Networks to improve the performance\
    \ for machine comprehension with relatively small volumes of training data. Additionally,\
    \ we explore various training regimes for Memory Networks to allow knowledge transfer\
    \ from a closely related domain having larger volumes of labelled data. We also\
    \ suggest the use of a loss function to incorporate the asymmetric nature of knowledge\
    \ transfer. Our experiments demonstrate improvements on Dailymail, CNN, and MCTest\

  abstract: This paper presents a framework to understand negation in positive terms.
    Specifically, we extract positive meaning from negation when the negation cue
    syntactically modifies a noun or adjective. Our approach is grounded on generating
    potential positive interpretations automatically, and then scoring them. Experimental
    results show that interpretations scored high can be reliably identified.

  abstract: In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm for word sense
    disambiguation (WSD) at the document level. Our algorithm is inspired by a widely-used
    approach in the field of genetics for whole genome sequencing, known as the Shotgun
    sequencing technique. The proposed WSD algorithm is based on three main steps.
    First, a brute-force WSD algorithm is applied to short context windows (up to
    10 words) selected from the document in order to generate a short list of likely
    sense configurations for each window. In the second step, these local sense configurations
    are assembled into longer composite configurations based on suffix and prefix
    matching. The resulted configurations are ranked by their length, and the sense
    of each word is chosen based on a voting scheme that considers only the top k
    configurations in which the word appears. We compare our algorithm with other
    state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD algorithms and demonstrate better performance,
    sometimes by a very large margin. We also show that our algorithm can yield better
    performance than the Most Common Sense (MCS) baseline on one data set. Moreover,
    our algorithm has a very small number of parameters, is robust to parameter tuning,
    and, unlike other bio-inspired methods, it gives a deterministic solution (it
    does not involve random choices).

  abstract: In language identification, a common first step in natural language processing,
    we want to automatically determine the language of some input text. Monolingual
    language identification assumes that the given document is written in one language.
    In multilingual language identification, the document is usually in two or three
    languages and we just want their names. We aim one step further and propose a
    method for textual language identification where languages can change arbitrarily
    and the goal is to identify the spans of each of the languages. Our method is
    based on Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks and it performs well in monolingual
    and multilingual language identification tasks on six datasets covering 131 languages.
    The method keeps the accuracy also for short documents and across domains, so
    it is ideal for off-the-shelf use without preparation of training data.

  abstract: Most languages have no established writing system and minimal written
    records. However, textual data is essential for natural language processing, and
    particularly important for training language models to support speech recognition.
    Even in cases where text data is missing, there are some languages for which bilingual
    lexicons are available, since creating lexicons is a fundamental task of documentary
    linguistics. We investigate the use of such lexicons to improve language models
    when textual training data is limited to as few as a thousand sentences. The method
    involves learning cross-lingual word embeddings as a preliminary step in training
    monolingual language models. Results across a number of languages show that language
    models are improved by this pre-training. Application to Yongning Na, a threatened
    language, highlights challenges in deploying the approach in real low-resource
    environments.

  abstract: "We propose a method to decide whether two occurrences of the same noun\
    \ in a source text should be translated consistently, i.e. using the same noun\
    \ in the target text as well. We train and test classifiers that predict consistent\
    \ translations based on lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. We first evaluate\
    \ the accuracy of our classifiers intrinsically, in terms of the accuracy of consistency\
    \ predictions, over a subset of the UN Corpus. Then, we also evaluate them in\
    \ combination with phrase-based statistical MT systems for Chinese-to-English\
    \ and German-to-English. We compare the automatic post-editing of noun translations\
    \ with the re-ranking of the translation hypotheses based on the classifiers\u2019\
    \ output, and also use these methods in combination. This improves over the baseline\

  abstract: 'While previous research on readability has typically focused on document-level
    measures, recent work in areas such as natural language generation has pointed
    out the need of sentence-level readability measures. Much of psycholinguistics
    has focused for many years on processing measures that provide difficulty estimates
    on a word-by-word basis. However, these psycholinguistic measures have not yet
    been tested on sentence readability ranking tasks. In this paper, we use four
    psycholinguistic measures: idea density, surprisal, integration cost, and embedding
    depth to test whether these features are predictive of readability levels. We
    find that psycholinguistic features significantly improve performance by up to
    3 percentage points over a standard document-level readability metric baseline.'

  abstract: The cataloging of product listings through taxonomy categorization is
    a fundamental problem for any e-commerce marketplace, with applications ranging
    from personalized search recommendations to query understanding. However, manual
    and rule based approaches to categorization are not scalable. In this paper, we
    compare several classifiers for categorizing listings in both English and Japanese
    product catalogs. We show empirically that a combination of words from product
    titles, navigational breadcrumbs, and list prices, when available, improves results
    significantly. We outline a novel method using correspondence topic models and
    a lightweight manual process to reduce noise from mis-labeled data in the training
    set. We contrast linear models, gradient boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs), and show that GBTs and CNNs yield the highest gains in
    error reduction. Finally, we show GBTs applied in a language-agnostic way on a
    large-scale Japanese e-commerce dataset have improved taxonomy categorization
    performance over current state-of-the-art based on deep belief network models.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose a new task for assessing the quality of natural
    language arguments. The premises of a well-reasoned argument should provide enough
    evidence for accepting or rejecting its claim. Although this criterion, known
    as sufficiency, is widely adopted in argumentation theory, there are no empirical
    studies on its applicability to real arguments. In this work, we show that human
    annotators substantially agree on the sufficiency criterion and introduce a novel
    annotated corpus. Furthermore, we experiment with feature-rich SVMs and Convolutional
    Neural Networks and achieve 84% accuracy for automatically identifying insufficiently
    supported arguments. The final corpus as well as the annotation guideline are
    freely available for encouraging future research on argument quality.

  abstract: Descriptive document clustering aims to automatically discover groups
    of semantically related documents and to assign a meaningful label to characterise
    the content of each cluster. In this paper, we present a descriptive clustering
    approach that employs a distributed representation model, namely the paragraph
    vector model, to capture semantic similarities between documents and phrases.
    The proposed method uses a joint representation of phrases and documents (i.e.,
    a co-embedding) to automatically select a descriptive phrase that best represents
    each document cluster. We evaluate our method by comparing its performance to
    an existing state-of-the-art descriptive clustering method that also uses co-embedding
    but relies on a bag-of-words representation. Results obtained on benchmark datasets
    demonstrate that the paragraph vector-based method obtains superior performance
    over the existing approach in both identifying clusters and assigning appropriate
    descriptive labels to them.

  abstract: Spanish is the third-most used language on the internet, after English
    and Chinese, with a total of 7.7% (more than 277 million of users) and a huge
    internet growth of more than 1,400%. However, most work on sentiment analysis
    has been focused on English. This paper describes a deep learning system for Spanish
    sentiment analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
    explores the use of a convolutional neural network to polarity classification
    of Spanish tweets.

  abstract: Traditional learning-based approaches to sentiment analysis of written
    text use the concept of bag-of-words or bag-of-n-grams, where a document is viewed
    as a set of terms or short combinations of terms disregarding grammar rules or
    word order. Novel approaches de-emphasize this concept and view the problem as
    a sequence classification problem. In this context, recurrent neural networks
    (RNNs) have achieved significant success. The idea is to use RNNs as discriminative
    binary classifiers to predict a positive or negative sentiment label at every
    word position then perform a type of pooling to get a sentence-level polarity.
    Here, we investigate a novel generative approach in which a separate probability
    distribution is estimated for every sentiment using language models (LMs) based
    on long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs. We introduce a novel type of LM using a
    modified version of bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) called contextual BLSTM (cBLSTM),
    where the probability of a word is estimated based on its full left and right
    contexts. Our approach is compared with a BLSTM binary classifier. Significant
    improvements are observed in classifying the IMDB movie review dataset. Further
    improvements are achieved via model combination.

  abstract: We investigate the task of open domain opinion relation extraction. Different
    from works on manually labeled corpus, we propose an efficient distantly supervised
    framework based on pattern matching and neural network classifiers. The patterns
    are designed to automatically generate training data, and the deep learning model
    is design to capture various lexical and syntactic features. The result algorithm
    is fast and scalable on large-scale corpus. We test the system on the Amazon online
    review dataset. The result shows that our model is able to achieve promising performances
    without any human annotations.

  abstract: Weighted finite automata and transducers (including hidden Markov models
    and conditional random fields) are widely used in natural language processing
    (NLP) to perform tasks such as morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging,
    chunking, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and others. Parallelizing
    finite state algorithms on graphics processing units (GPUs) would benefit many
    areas of NLP. Although researchers have implemented GPU versions of basic graph
    algorithms, no work, to our knowledge, has been done on GPU algorithms for weighted
    finite automata. We introduce a GPU implementation of the Viterbi and forward-backward
    algorithm, achieving speedups of up to 4x over our serial implementations running
    on different computer architectures and 3335x over widely used tools such as OpenFST.

  abstract: Translating in real-time, a.k.a.simultaneous translation, outputs translation
    words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging problem for conventional
    machine translation methods. We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) framework
    for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when
    to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained NMT environment. To trade
    off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design
    a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments
    against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy
    of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  abstract: We aim to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the newly introduced
    neural machine translation paradigm. To that end, we conduct a multifaceted evaluation
    in which we compare outputs produced by state-of-the-art neural machine translation
    and phrase-based machine translation systems for 9 language directions across
    a number of dimensions. Specifically, we measure the similarity of the outputs,
    their fluency and amount of reordering, the effect of sentence length and performance
    across different error categories. We find out that translations produced by neural
    machine translation systems are considerably different, more fluent and more accurate
    in terms of word order compared to those produced by phrase-based systems. Neural
    machine translation systems are also more accurate at producing inflected forms,
    but they perform poorly when translating very long sentences.

  abstract: "The language that we produce reflects our personality, and various personal\
    \ and demographic characteristics can be detected in natural language texts. We\
    \ focus on one particular personal trait of the author, gender, and study how\
    \ it is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that author\u2019\
    s gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals texts, but this signal is obfuscated\
    \ in human and machine translation. We then propose simple domain-adaptation techniques\
    \ that help retain the original gender traits in the translation, without harming\
    \ the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation\
    \ systems."

  abstract: We study the problem of bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) in a setting
    where some translation resources are available, but unknown translations are sought
    for certain, possibly domain-specific terminology. We frame BLI as a classification
    problem for which we design a neural network based classification architecture
    composed of recurrent long short-term memory and deep feed forward networks. The
    results show that word- and character-level representations each improve state-of-the-art
    results for BLI, and the best results are obtained by exploiting the synergy between
    these word- and character-level representations in the classification model.

  abstract: 'The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks,
    in particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks. However, these architectures
    are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional networks which have
    pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vision. We present a new architecture
    (VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the character level and
    uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. We are able to show that
    the performance of this model increases with the depth: using up to 29 convolutional
    layers, we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public text
    classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
    very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text processing.'

  abstract: Authorship attribution is associated with important applications in forensics
    and humanities research. A crucial point in this field is to quantify the personal
    style of writing, ideally in a way that is not affected by changes in topic or
    genre. In this paper, we present a novel method that enhances authorship attribution
    effectiveness by introducing a text distortion step before extracting stylometric
    measures. The proposed method attempts to mask topic-specific information that
    is not related to the personal style of authors. Based on experiments on two main
    tasks in authorship attribution, closed-set attribution and authorship verification,
    we demonstrate that the proposed approach can enhance existing methods especially
    under cross-topic conditions, where the training and test corpora do not match
    in topic.

  abstract: We propose a scalable structured learning model that jointly predicts
    temporal relations between events and temporal expressions (TLINKS), and the relation
    between these events and the document creation time (DCTR). We employ a structured
    perceptron, together with integer linear programming constraints for document-level
    inference during training and prediction to exploit relational properties of temporality,
    together with global learning of the relations at the document level. Moreover,
    this study gives insights in the results of integrating constraints for temporal
    relation extraction when using structured learning and prediction. Our best system
    outperforms the state-of-the art on both the CONTAINS TLINK task, and the DCTR
    task.

  abstract: Text mining has drawn significant attention in recent past due to the
    rapid growth in biomedical and clinical records. Entity extraction is one of the
    fundamental components for biomedical text mining. In this paper, we propose a
    novel approach of feature selection for entity extraction that exploits the concept
    of deep learning and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The system utilizes word
    embedding features along with several other features extracted by studying the
    properties of the datasets. We obtain an interesting observation that compact
    word embedding features as determined by PSO are more effective compared to the
    entire word embedding feature set for entity extraction. The proposed system is
    evaluated on three benchmark biomedical datasets such as GENIA, GENETAG, and AiMed.
    The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evident with significant performance
    gains over the baseline models as well as the other existing systems. We observe
    improvements of 7.86%, 5.27% and 7.25% F-measure points over the baseline models
    for GENIA, GENETAG, and AiMed dataset respectively.

  abstract: The growing demand for structured knowledge has led to great interest
    in relation extraction, especially in cases with limited supervision. However,
    existing distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in single
    sentences. In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is under-explored, even
    in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we propose the first approach
    for applying distant supervision to cross-sentence relation extraction. At the
    core of our approach is a graph representation that can incorporate both standard
    dependencies and discourse relations, thus providing a unifying way to model relations
    within and across sentences. We extract features from multiple paths in this graph,
    increasing accuracy and robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and
    analysis error. Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine
    show that our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only
    a small existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles.
    Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted
    twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence
    of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we address two different types of noise in information
    extraction models: noise from distant supervision and noise from pipeline input
    features. Our target tasks are entity typing and relation extraction. For the
    first noise type, we introduce multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms
    using neural network models, and apply them to fine-grained entity typing for
    the first time. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised approach
    which uses global embeddings of entities. For the second noise type, we propose
    ways to improve the integration of noisy entity type predictions into relation
    extraction. Our experiments show that probabilistic predictions are more robust
    than discrete predictions and that joint training of the two tasks performs best.'

  abstract: We analyze semantic changes in loanwords from English that are used in
    Japanese (Japanese loanwords). Specifically, we create word embeddings of English
    and Japanese and map the Japanese embeddings into the English space so that we
    can calculate the similarity of each Japanese word and each English word. We then
    attempt to find loanwords that are semantically different from their original,
    see if known meaning changes are correctly captured, and show the possibility
    of using our methodology in language education.

  abstract: Most current approaches in phylogenetic linguistics require as input multilingual
    word lists partitioned into sets of etymologically related words (cognates). Cognate
    identification is so far done manually by experts, which is time consuming and
    as of yet only available for a small number of well-studied language families.
    Automatizing this step will greatly expand the empirical scope of phylogenetic
    methods in linguistics, as raw wordlists (in phonetic transcription) are much
    easier to obtain than wordlists in which cognate words have been fully identified
    and annotated, even for under-studied languages. A couple of different methods
    have been proposed in the past, but they are either disappointing regarding their
    performance or not applicable to larger datasets. Here we present a new approach
    that uses support vector machines to unify different state-of-the-art methods
    for phonetic alignment and cognate detection within a single framework. Training
    and evaluating these method on a typologically broad collection of gold-standard
    data shows it to be superior to the existing state of the art.

  abstract: We investigate the value of feature engineering and neural network models
    for predicting successful writing. Similar to previous work, we treat this as
    a binary classification task and explore new strategies to automatically learn
    representations from book contents. We evaluate our feature set on two different
    corpora created from Project Gutenberg books. The first presents a novel approach
    for generating the gold standard labels for the task and the other is based on
    prior research. Using a combination of hand-crafted and recurrent neural network
    learned representations in a dual learning setting, we obtain the best performance
    of 73.50% weighted F1-score.

  abstract: We consider the task of predicting how literary a text is, with a gold
    standard from human ratings. Aside from a standard bigram baseline, we apply rich
    syntactic tree fragments, mined from the training set, and a series of hand-picked
    features. Our model is the first to distinguish degrees of highly and less literary
    novels using a variety of lexical and syntactic features, and explains 76.0 %
    of the variation in literary ratings.

  abstract: Political surveys have indicated a relationship between a sense of Scottish
    identity and voting decisions in the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum. Identity
    is often reflected in language use, suggesting the intuitive hypothesis that individuals
    who support Scottish independence are more likely to use distinctively Scottish
    words than those who oppose it. In the first large-scale study of sociolinguistic
    variation on social media in the UK, we identify distinctively Scottish terms
    in a data-driven way, and find that these terms are indeed used at a higher rate
    by users of pro-independence hashtags than by users of anti-independence hashtags.
    However, we also find that in general people are less likely to use distinctively
    Scottish words in tweets with referendum-related hashtags than in their general
    Twitter activity. We attribute this difference to style shifting relative to audience,
    aligning with previous work showing that Twitter users tend to use fewer local
    variants when addressing a broader audience.

  abstract: In this work, we investigate several neural network architectures for
    fine-grained entity type classification and make three key contributions. Despite
    being a natural comparison and addition, previous work on attentive neural architectures
    have not considered hand-crafted features and we combine these with learnt features
    and establish that they complement each other. Additionally, through quantitative
    analysis we establish that the attention mechanism learns to attend over syntactic
    heads and the phrase containing the mention, both of which are known to be strong
    hand-crafted features for our task. We introduce parameter sharing between labels
    through a hierarchical encoding method, that in low-dimensional projections show
    clear clusters for each type hierarchy. Lastly, despite using the same evaluation
    dataset, the literature frequently compare models trained using different data.
    We demonstrate that the choice of training data has a drastic impact on performance,
    which decreases by as much as 9.85% loose micro F1 score for a previously proposed
    method. Despite this discrepancy, our best model achieves state-of-the-art results
    with 75.36% loose micro F1 score on the well-established Figer (GOLD) dataset
    and we report the best results for models trained using publicly available data
    for the OntoNotes dataset with 64.93% loose micro F1 score.

  abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD) is becoming a standard annotation scheme cross-linguistically,
    but it is argued that this scheme centering on content words is harder to parse
    than the conventional one centering on function words. To improve the parsability
    of UD, we propose a back-and-forth conversion algorithm, in which we preprocess
    the training treebank to increase parsability, and reconvert the parser outputs
    to follow the UD scheme as a postprocess. We show that this technique consistently
    improves LAS across languages even with a state-of-the-art parser, in particular
    on core dependency arcs such as nominal modifier. We also provide an in-depth
    analysis to understand why our method increases parsability.

  abstract: We introduce the URIEL knowledge base for massively multilingual NLP and
    the lang2vec utility, which provides information-rich vector identifications of
    languages drawn from typological, geographical, and phylogenetic databases and
    normalized to have straightforward and consistent formats, naming, and semantics.
    The goal of URIEL and lang2vec is to enable multilingual NLP, especially on less-resourced
    languages and make possible types of experiments (especially but not exclusively
    related to NLP tasks) that are otherwise difficult or impossible due to the sparsity
    and incommensurability of the data sources. lang2vec vectors have been shown to
    reduce perplexity in multilingual language modeling, when compared to one-hot
    language identification vectors.

  abstract: Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) is a learning procedure that is regularly
    used to train neural language models, since it avoids the computational bottleneck
    caused by the output softmax. In this paper, we attempt to explain some of the
    weaknesses of this objective function, and to draw directions for further developments.
    Experiments on a small task show the issues raised by an unigram noise distribution,
    and that a context dependent noise distribution, such as the bigram distribution,
    can solve these issues and provide stable and data-efficient learning.

  abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results across many language
    processing tasks, however they have been shown to be susceptible to overfitting
    and highly sensitive to noise, including adversarial attacks. In this work, we
    propose a linguistically-motivated approach for training robust models based on
    exposing the model to corrupted text examples at training time. We consider several
    flavours of linguistically plausible corruption, include lexical semantic and
    syntactic methods. Empirically, we evaluate our method with a convolutional neural
    model across a range of sentiment analysis datasets. Compared with a baseline
    and the dropout method, our method achieves better overall performance.

  abstract: "We explore whether social media can provide a window into community real\
    \ estate -foreclosure rates and price changes- beyond that of traditional economic\
    \ and demographic variables. We find language use in Twitter not only predicts\
    \ real estate outcomes as well as traditional variables across counties, but that\
    \ including Twitter language in traditional models leads to a significant improvement\
    \ (e.g. from Pearson r = :50 to r = :59 for price changes). We overcome the challenge\
    \ of the relative sparsity and noise in Twitter language variables by showing\
    \ that training on the residual error of the traditional models leads to more\
    \ accurate overall assessments. Finally, we discover that it is Twitter language\
    \ related to business (e.g. \u2018company\u2019, \u2018marketing\u2019) and technology\
    \ (e.g. \u2018technology\u2019, \u2018internet\u2019), among others, that yield\
    \ predictive power over economics."

  abstract: We present a new Lexical Simplification approach that exploits Neural
    Networks to learn substitutions from the Newsela corpus - a large set of professionally
    produced simplifications. We extract candidate substitutions by combining the
    Newsela corpus with a retrofitted context-aware word embeddings model and rank
    them using a new neural regression model that learns rankings from annotated data.
    This strategy leads to the highest Accuracy, Precision and F1 scores to date in
    standard datasets for the task.

  abstract: 'This paper discusses some central caveats of summarisation, incurred
    in the use of the ROUGE metric for evaluation, with respect to optimal solutions.
    The task is NP-hard, of which we give the first proof. Still, as we show empirically
    for three central benchmark datasets for the task, greedy algorithms empirically
    seem to perform optimally according to the metric. Additionally, overall quality
    assurance is problematic: there is no natural upper bound on the quality of summarisation
    systems, and even humans are excluded from performing optimal summarisation.'

  abstract: We present an iterative annotation process for producing aligned, parallel
    corpora of abstractive and extractive summaries for narrative. Our approach uses
    a combination of trained annotators and crowd-sourcing, allowing us to elicit
    human-generated summaries and alignments quickly and at low cost. We use crowd-sourcing
    to annotate aligned phrases with the text-to-text generation techniques needed
    to transform each phrase into the other. We apply this process to a corpus of
    476 personal narratives, which we make available on the Web.

  abstract: Progress in text understanding has been driven by large datasets that
    test particular capabilities, like recent datasets for reading comprehension (Hermann
    et al., 2015). We focus here on the LAMBADA dataset (Paperno et al., 2016), a
    word prediction task requiring broader context than the immediate sentence. We
    view LAMBADA as a reading comprehension problem and apply comprehension models
    based on neural networks. Though these models are constrained to choose a word
    from the context, they improve the state of the art on LAMBADA from 7.3% to 49%.
    We analyze 100 instances, finding that neural network readers perform well in
    cases that involve selecting a name from the context based on dialogue or discourse
    cues but struggle when coreference resolution or external knowledge is needed.

  abstract: Cross-lingual information extraction is the task of distilling facts from
    foreign language (e.g. Chinese text) into representations in another language
    that is preferred by the user (e.g. English tuples). Conventional pipeline solutions
    decompose the task as machine translation followed by information extraction (or
    vice versa). We propose a joint solution with a neural sequence model, and show
    that it outperforms the pipeline in a cross-lingual open information extraction
    setting by 1-4 BLEU and 0.5-0.8 F1.

  abstract: "Instances (\u201CMozart\u201D) are ontologically distinct from concepts\
    \ or classes (\u201Ccomposer\u201D). Natural language encompasses both, but instances\
    \ have received comparatively little attention in distributional semantics. Our\
    \ results show that instances and concepts differ in their distributional properties.\
    \ We also establish that instantiation detection (\u201CMozart \u2013 composer\u201D\
    ) is generally easier than hypernymy detection (\u201Cchemist \u2013 scientist\u201D\
    ), and that results on the influence of input representation do not transfer from\
    \ hyponymy to instantiation."

  abstract: There has recently been a lot of work trying to use images of referents
    of words for improving vector space meaning representations derived from text.
    We investigate the opposite direction, as it were, trying to improve visual word
    predictors that identify objects in images, by exploiting distributional similarity
    information during training. We show that for certain words (such as entry-level
    nouns or hypernyms), we can indeed learn better referential word meanings by taking
    into account their semantic similarity to other words. For other words, there
    is no or even a detrimental effect, compared to a learning setup that presents
    even semantically related objects as negative instances.

  abstract: There is a relationship between what we say and where we say it. Word
    embeddings are usually trained assuming that semantically-similar words occur
    within the same textual contexts. We investigate the extent to which semantically-similar
    words occur within the same geospatial contexts. We enrich a corpus of geolocated
    Twitter posts with physical data derived from Google Places and OpenStreetMap,
    and train word embeddings using the resulting geospatial contexts. Intrinsic evaluation
    of the resulting vectors shows that geographic context alone does provide useful
    information about semantic relatedness.

  abstract: Emojis are ideograms which are naturally combined with plain text to visually
    complement or condense the meaning of a message. Despite being widely used in
    social media, their underlying semantics have received little attention from a
    Natural Language Processing standpoint. In this paper, we investigate the relation
    between words and emojis, studying the novel task of predicting which emojis are
    evoked by text-based tweet messages. We train several models based on Long Short-Term
    Memory networks (LSTMs) in this task. Our experimental results show that our neural
    model outperforms a baseline as well as humans solving the same task, suggesting
    that computational models are able to better capture the underlying semantics
    of emojis.

  abstract: "A traditional claim in linguistics is that all human languages are equally\
    \ expressive\u2014able to convey the same wide range of meanings. Morphologically\
    \ rich languages, such as Czech, rely on overt inflectional and derivational morphology\
    \ to convey many semantic distinctions. Languages with comparatively limited morphology,\
    \ such as English, should be able to accomplish the same using a combination of\
    \ syntactic and contextual cues. We capitalize on this idea by training a tagger\
    \ for English that uses syntactic features obtained by automatic parsing to recover\
    \ complex morphological tags projected from Czech. The high accuracy of the resulting\
    \ model provides quantitative confirmation of the underlying linguistic hypothesis\
    \ of equal expressivity, and bodes well for future improvements in downstream\
    \ HLT tasks including machine translation."

  abstract: Derivational morphology is a fundamental and complex characteristic of
    language. In this paper we propose a new task of predicting the derivational form
    of a given base-form lemma that is appropriate for a given context. We present
    an encoder-decoder style neural network to produce a derived form character-by-character,
    based on its corresponding character-level representation of the base form and
    the context. We demonstrate that our model is able to generate valid context-sensitive
    derivations from known base forms, but is less accurate under lexicon agnostic
    setting.

  abstract: 'What is the information captured by neural network models of language?
    We address this question in the case of character-level recurrent neural language
    models. These models do not have explicit word representations; do they acquire
    implicit ones? We assess the lexical capacity of a network using the lexical decision
    task common in psycholinguistics: the system is required to decide whether or
    not a string of characters forms a word. We explore how accuracy on this task
    is affected by the architecture of the network, focusing on cell type (LSTM vs.
    SRN), depth and width. We also compare these architectural properties to a simple
    count of the parameters of the network. The overall number of parameters in the
    network turns out to be the most important predictor of accuracy; in particular,
    there is little evidence that deeper networks are beneficial for this task.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we pursue the hypothesis that the distribution of article
    omission specifically is constrained by principles of Information Theory (Shannon
    1948). In particular, Information Theory predicts a stronger preference for article
    omission before nouns which are relatively unpredictable in context of the preceding
    words. We investigated article omission in German newspaper headlines with a corpus
    and acceptability rating study. Both support our hypothesis: Articles are inserted
    more often before unpredictable nouns and subjects perceive article omission before
    predictable nouns as more well-formed than before unpredictable ones. This suggests
    that information theoretic principles constrain the distribution of article omission
    in headlines.'

  abstract: We study the topmost weight matrix of neural network language models.
    We show that this matrix constitutes a valid word embedding. When training language
    models, we recommend tying the input embedding and this output embedding. We analyze
    the resulting update rules and show that the tied embedding evolves in a more
    similar way to the output embedding than to the input embedding in the untied
    model. We also offer a new method of regularizing the output embedding. Our methods
    lead to a significant reduction in perplexity, as we are able to show on a variety
    of neural network language models. Finally, we show that weight tying can reduce
    the size of neural translation models to less than half of their original size
    without harming their performance.

  abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) in deep neural networks for NLP has recently
    received increasing interest due to some compelling benefits, including its potential
    to efficiently regularize models and to reduce the need for labeled data. While
    it has brought significant improvements in a number of NLP tasks, mixed results
    have been reported, and little is known about the conditions under which MTL leads
    to gains in NLP. This paper sheds light on the specific task relations that can
    lead to gains from MTL models over single-task setups.

  abstract: We present a novel, unsupervised, and distance measure agnostic method
    for search space reduction in spell correction using neural character embeddings.
    The embeddings are learned by skip-gram word2vec training on sequences generated
    from dictionary words in a phonetic information-retentive manner. We report a
    very high performance in terms of both success rates and reduction of search space
    on the Birkbeck spelling error corpus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first application of word2vec to spell correction.

  abstract: The popular skip-gram model induces word embeddings by exploiting the
    signal from word-context coocurrence. We offer a new interpretation of skip-gram
    based on exponential family PCA-a form of matrix factorization to generalize the
    skip-gram model to tensor factorization. In turn, this lets us train embeddings
    through richer higher-order coocurrences, e.g., triples that include positional
    information (to incorporate syntax) or morphological information (to share parameters
    across related words). We experiment on 40 languages and show our model improves
    upon skip-gram.

  abstract: Children comprise a significant proportion of TV viewers and it is worthwhile
    to customize the experience for them. However, identifying who is a child in the
    audience can be a challenging task. We present initial studies of a novel method
    which combines utterances with user metadata. In particular, we develop an ensemble
    of different machine learning techniques on different subsets of data to improve
    child detection. Our initial results show an 9.2% absolute improvement over the
    baseline, leading to a state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract: In this work, we tackle a problem of speech emotion classification. One
    of the issues in the area of affective computation is that the amount of annotated
    data is very limited. On the other hand, the number of ways that the same emotion
    can be expressed verbally is enormous due to variability between speakers. This
    is one of the factors that limits performance and generalization. We propose a
    simple method that extracts audio samples from movies using textual sentiment
    analysis. As a result, it is possible to automatically construct a larger dataset
    of audio samples with positive, negative emotional and neutral speech. We show
    that pretraining recurrent neural network on such a dataset yields better results
    on the challenging EmotiW corpus. This experiment shows a potential benefit of
    combining textual sentiment analysis with vocal information.

  abstract: "On-line dialogue policy learning is the key for building evolvable conversational\
    \ agent in real world scenarios. Poor initial policy can easily lead to bad user\
    \ experience and consequently fail to attract sufficient users for policy training.\
    \ A novel framework, companion teaching, is proposed to include a human teacher\
    \ in the dialogue policy training loop to address the cold start problem. Here,\
    \ dialogue policy is trained using not only user\u2019s reward, but also teacher\u2019\
    s example action as well as estimated immediate reward at turn level. Simulation\
    \ experiments showed that, with small number of human teaching dialogues, the\
    \ proposed approach can effectively improve user experience at the beginning and\
    \ smoothly lead to good performance with more user interaction data."

  abstract: This paper presents a hybrid dialog state tracker enhanced by trainable
    Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) for slot-filling dialog systems. Our architecture
    is inspired by previously proposed neural-network-based belief-tracking systems.
    In addition, we extended some parts of our modular architecture with differentiable
    rules to allow end-to-end training. We hypothesize that these rules allow our
    tracker to generalize better than pure machine-learning based systems. For evaluation,
    we used the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset - a popular belief
    tracking testbed with dialogs from restaurant information system. To our knowledge,
    our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result in three out of four categories
    within the DSTC2.

  abstract: The task of morphological analysis is to produce a complete list of lemma+tag
    analyses for a given word-form. We propose a discriminative string transduction
    approach which exploits plain inflection tables and raw text corpora, thus obviating
    the need for expert annotation. Experiments on four languages demonstrate that
    our system has much higher coverage than a hand-engineered FST analyzer, and is
    more accurate than a state-of-the-art morphological tagger.

    to set state-of-the-art results on these corpora on both tasks, beating techniques
    proposed in the literature by as much as 4 points in segmentation F1.

    lexical items with information about domains of knowledge. We propose an automatic
    method that uses knowledge from various lexical resources, exploiting both distributional
    and graph-based clues, to accurately propagate domain information. We evaluate
    our methodology intrinsically on two lexical resources (WordNet and BabelNet),
    achieving a precision over 80% in both cases. Finally, we show the potential of
    BabelDomains in a supervised learning setting, clustering training data by domain
    for hypernym discovery.

  abstract: We present a new parallel corpus, JHU FLuency-Extended GUG corpus (JFLEG)
    for developing and evaluating grammatical error correction (GEC). Unlike other
    corpora, it represents a broad range of language proficiency levels and uses holistic
    fluency edits to not only correct grammatical errors but also make the original
    text more native sounding. We describe the types of corrections made and benchmark
    four leading GEC systems on this corpus, identifying specific areas in which they
    do well and how they can improve. JFLEG fulfills the need for a new gold standard
    to properly assess the current state of GEC.

  abstract: We present Arab-Acquis, a large publicly available dataset for evaluating
    machine translation between 22 European languages and Arabic. Arab-Acquis consists
    of over 12,000 sentences from the JRC-Acquis (Acquis Communautaire) corpus translated
    twice by professional translators, once from English and once from French, and
    totaling over 600,000 words. The corpus follows previous data splits in the literature
    for tuning, development, and testing. We describe the corpus and how it was created.
    We also present the first benchmarking results on translating to and from Arabic
    for 22 European languages.

  abstract: 'The Parallel Meaning Bank is a corpus of translations annotated with
    shared, formal meaning representations comprising over 11 million words divided
    over four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch). Our approach is based
    on cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected) semantic
    annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned translations,
    assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The semantic annotation
    consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text in sentences and lexical
    items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal
    semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and (v) compositional semantic analysis
    based on Discourse Representation Theory. These steps are performed using statistical
    models trained in a semi-supervised manner. The employed annotation models are
    all language-neutral. Our first results are promising.'

  abstract: We address the challenge of cross-lingual POS tagger evaluation in absence
    of manually annotated test data. We put forth and evaluate two dictionary-based
    metrics. On the tasks of accuracy prediction and system ranking, we reveal that
    these metrics are reliable enough to approximate test set-based evaluation, and
    at the same time lean enough to support assessment for truly low-resource languages.

  abstract: "In this paper, we present a Wikipedia-based approach to develop resources\
    \ for the legal domain. We establish a mapping between a legal domain ontology,\
    \ LKIF (Hoekstra et al. 2007), and a Wikipedia-based ontology, YAGO (Suchanek\
    \ et al. 2007), and through that we populate LKIF. Moreover, we use the mentions\
    \ of those entities in Wikipedia text to train a specific Named Entity Recognizer\
    \ and Classifier. We find that this classifier works well in the Wikipedia, but,\
    \ as could be expected, performance decreases in a corpus of judgments of the\
    \ European Court of Human Rights. However, this tool will be used as a preprocess\
    \ for human annotation. We resort to a technique called \u201Ccurriculum learning\u201D\
    \ aimed to overcome problems of overfitting by learning increasingly more complex\
    \ concepts. However, we find that in this particular setting, the method works\
    \ best by learning from most specific to most general concepts, not the other\
    \ way round."

  abstract: This paper presents work on using continuous representations for authorship
    attribution. In contrast to previous work, which uses discrete feature representations,
    our model learns continuous representations for n-gram features via a neural network
    jointly with the classification layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the
    proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on two datasets, while producing
    comparable results on the remaining two.

  abstract: In this paper, we address the (to the best of our knowledge) new problem
    of extracting a structured description of real estate properties from their natural
    language descriptions in classifieds. We survey and present several models to
    (a) identify important entities of a property (e.g.,rooms) from classifieds and
    (b) structure them into a tree format, with the entities as nodes and edges representing
    a part-of relation. Experiments show that a graph-based system deriving the tree
    from an initially fully connected entity graph, outperforms a transition-based
    system starting from only the entity nodes, since it better reconstructs the tree.

  abstract: 'State-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems are generally
    trained on specific domains by carefully selecting the training sets and applying
    proper domain adaptation techniques. In this paper we consider the real world
    scenario in which the target domain is not predefined, hence the system should
    be able to translate text from multiple domains. We compare the performance of
    a generic NMT system and phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBMT) system
    by training them on a generic parallel corpus composed of data from different
    domains. Our results on multi-domain English-French data show that, in these realistic
    conditions, PBMT outperforms its neural counterpart. This raises the question:
    is NMT ready for deployment as a generic/multi-purpose MT backbone in real-world
    settings?'

  abstract: This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that
    is often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to jointly
    estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the encoder and
    control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder. Our method shows
    significant improvement over a strong RNN-based encoder-decoder baseline and achieved
    its best results on an abstractive summarization benchmark.

  abstract: Musical parody, i.e. the act of changing the lyrics of an existing and
    very well-known song, is a commonly used technique for creating catchy advertising
    tunes and for mocking people or events. Here we describe a system for automatically
    producing a musical parody, starting from a corpus of songs. The system can automatically
    identify characterizing words and concepts related to a novel text, which are
    taken from the daily news. These concepts are then used as seeds to appropriately
    replace part of the original lyrics of a song, using metrical, rhyming and lexical
    constraints. Finally, the parody can be sung with a singing speech synthesizer,
    with no intervention from the user.

  abstract: This paper presents an efficient and optimal parsing algorithm for probabilistic
    context-free grammars (PCFGs). To achieve faster parsing, our proposal employs
    a pruning technique to reduce unnecessary edges in the search space. The key is
    to conduct repetitively Viterbi inside and outside parsing, while gradually expanding
    the search space to efficiently compute heuristic bounds used for pruning. Our
    experimental results using the English Penn Treebank corpus show that the proposed
    algorithm is faster than the standard CKY parsing algorithm. In addition, we also
    show how to extend this algorithm to extract k-best Viterbi parse trees.

  abstract: 'Prepostitional phrase (PP) attachment is a well known challenge to parsing.
    In this paper, we combine the insights of different works, namely: (1) treating
    PP attachment as a classification task with an arbitrary number of attachment
    candidates; (2) using auxiliary distributions to augment the data beyond the hand-annotated
    training set; (3) using topological fields to get information about the distribution
    of PP attachment throughout clauses and (4) using state-of-the-art techniques
    such as word embeddings and neural networks. We show that jointly using these
    techniques leads to substantial improvements. We also conduct a qualitative analysis
    to gauge where the ceiling of the task is in a realistic setup.'

  abstract: This paper formalizes a sound extension of dynamic oracles to global training,
    in the frame of transition-based dependency parsers. By dispensing with the pre-computation
    of references, this extension widens the training strategies that can be entertained
    for such parsers; we show this by revisiting two standard training procedures,
    early-update and max-violation, to correct some of their search space sampling
    biases. Experimentally, on the SPMRL treebanks, this improvement increases the
    similarity between the train and test distributions and yields performance improvements
    up to 0.7 UAS, without any computation overhead.

  abstract: In this paper, we propose efficient and less resource-intensive strategies
    for parsing of code-mixed data. These strategies are not constrained by in-domain
    annotations, rather they leverage pre-existing monolingual annotated resources
    for training. We show that these methods can produce significantly better results
    as compared to an informed baseline. Due to lack of an evaluation set for code-mixed
    structures, we also present a data set of 450 Hindi and English code-mixed tweets
    of Hindi multilingual speakers for evaluation.

  abstract: While dependency parsers reach very high overall accuracy, some dependency
    relations are much harder than others. In particular, dependency parsers perform
    poorly in coordination construction (i.e., correctly attaching the conj relation).
    We extend a state-of-the-art dependency parser with conjunction-specific features,
    focusing on the similarity between the conjuncts head words. Training the extended
    parser yields an improvement in conj attachment as well as in overall dependency
    parsing accuracy on the Stanford dependency conversion of the Penn TreeBank.

  abstract: We present a novel scheme to combine neural machine translation (NMT)
    with traditional statistical machine translation (SMT). Our approach borrows ideas
    from linearised lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding for SMT. The NMT score is
    combined with the Bayes-risk of the translation according the SMT lattice. This
    makes our approach much more flexible than n-best list or lattice rescoring as
    the neural decoder is not restricted to the SMT search space. We show an efficient
    and simple way to integrate risk estimation into the NMT decoder which is suitable
    for word-level as well as subword-unit-level NMT. We test our method on English-German
    and Japanese-English and report significant gains over lattice rescoring on several
    data sets for both single and ensembled NMT. The MBR decoder produces entirely
    new hypotheses far beyond simply rescoring the SMT search space or fixing UNKs
    in the NMT output.

  abstract: Translating into morphologically rich languages is difficult. Although
    the coverage of lemmas may be reasonable, many morphological variants cannot be
    learned from the training data. We present a statistical translation system that
    is able to produce these inflected word forms. Different from most previous work,
    we do not separate morphological prediction from lexical choice into two consecutive
    steps. Our approach is novel in that it is integrated in decoding and takes advantage
    of context information from both the source language and the target language sides.

  abstract: Analysing translation quality in regards to specific linguistic phenomena
    has historically been difficult and time-consuming. Neural machine translation
    has the attractive property that it can produce scores for arbitrary translations,
    and we propose a novel method to assess how well NMT systems model specific linguistic
    phenomena such as agreement over long distances, the production of novel words,
    and the faithful translation of polarity. The core idea is that we measure whether
    a reference translation is more probable under a NMT model than a contrastive
    translation which introduces a specific type of error. We present LingEval97,
    a large-scale data set of 97000 contrastive translation pairs based on the WMT
    English->German translation task, with errors automatically created with simple
    rules. We report results for a number of systems, and find that recently introduced
    character-level NMT systems perform better at transliteration than models with
    byte-pair encoding (BPE) segmentation, but perform more poorly at morphosyntactic
    agreement, and translating discontiguous units of meaning.

  abstract: Knowing which words have been attended to in previous time steps while
    generating a translation is a rich source of information for predicting what words
    will be attended to in the future. We improve upon the attention model of Bahdanau
    et al. (2014) by explicitly modeling the relationship between previous and subsequent
    attention levels for each word using one recurrent network per input word. This
    architecture easily captures informative features, such as fertility and regularities
    in relative distortion. In experiments, we show our parameterization of attention
    improves translation quality.

  abstract: We put forward an approach that exploits the knowledge encoded in lexical
    resources in order to induce representations for words that were not encountered
    frequently during training. Our approach provides an advantage over the past work
    in that it enables vocabulary expansion not only for morphological variations,
    but also for infrequent domain specific terms. We performed evaluations in different
    settings, showing that the technique can provide consistent improvements on multiple
    benchmarks across domains.

  abstract: "We develop a novel cross-lingual word representation model which injects\
    \ syntactic information through dependency-based contexts into a shared cross-lingual\
    \ word vector space. The model, termed CL-DepEmb, is based on the following assumptions:\
    \ (1) dependency relations are largely language-independent, at least for related\
    \ languages and prominent dependency links such as direct objects, as evidenced\
    \ by the Universal Dependencies project; (2) word translation equivalents take\
    \ similar grammatical roles in a sentence and are therefore substitutable within\
    \ their syntactic contexts. Experiments with several language pairs on word similarity\
    \ and bilingual lexicon induction, two fundamental semantic tasks emphasising\
    \ semantic similarity, suggest the usefulness of the proposed syntactically informed\
    \ cross-lingual word vector spaces. Improvements are observed in both tasks over\
    \ standard cross-lingual \u201Coffline mapping\u201D baselines trained using the\
    \ same setup and an equal level of bilingual supervision."

  abstract: We explore the ability of word embeddings to capture both semantic and
    morphological similarity, as affected by the different types of linguistic properties
    (surface form, lemma, morphological tag) used to compose the representation of
    each word. We train several models, where each uses a different subset of these
    properties to compose its representations. By evaluating the models on semantic
    and morphological measures, we reveal some useful insights on the relationship
    between semantics and morphology.

  abstract: It is often assumed that topic models benefit from the use of a manually
    curated stopword list. Constructing this list is time-consuming and often subject
    to user judgments about what kinds of words are important to the model and the
    application. Although stopword removal clearly affects which word types appear
    as most probable terms in topics, we argue that this improvement is superficial,
    and that topic inference benefits little from the practice of removing stopwords
    beyond very frequent terms. Removing corpus-specific stopwords after model inference
    is more transparent and produces similar results to removing those words prior
    to inference.

  abstract: Measuring topic quality is essential for scoring the learned topics and
    their subsequent use in Information Retrieval and Text classification. To measure
    quality of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topics learned from text, we
    propose a novel approach based on grouping of topic words into buckets (TBuckets).
    A single large bucket signifies a single coherent theme, in turn indicating high
    topic coherence. TBuckets uses word embeddings of topic words and employs singular
    value decomposition (SVD) and Integer Linear Programming based optimization to
    create coherent word buckets. TBuckets outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques
    when evaluated using 3 publicly available datasets and on another one proposed
    in this paper.

  abstract: "The success of sentence classification often depends on understanding\
    \ both the syntactic and semantic properties of word-phrases. Recent progress\
    \ on this task has been based on exploiting the grammatical structure of sentences\
    \ but often this structure is difficult to parse and noisy. In this paper, we\
    \ propose a structure-independent \u2018Gated Representation Alignment\u2019 (GRA)\
    \ model that blends a phrase-focused Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach\
    \ with sequence-oriented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Our novel alignment mechanism\
    \ allows the RNN to selectively include phrase information in a word-by-word sentence\
    \ representation, and to do this without awareness of the syntactic structure.\
    \ An empirical evaluation of GRA shows higher prediction accuracy (up to 4.6%)\
    \ of fine-grained sentiment ratings, when compared to other structure-independent\
    \ baselines. We also show comparable results to several structure-dependent methods.\
    \ Finally, we analyzed the effect of our alignment mechanism and found that this\
    \ is critical to the effectiveness of the CNN-RNN hybrid."

  abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of activity in learning distributed representations
    of words in vector spaces. Although there are models capable of learning high-quality
    distributed representations of words, how to generate vector representations of
    the same quality for phrases or documents still remains a challenge. In this paper,
    we propose to model each document as a multivariate Gaussian distribution based
    on the distributed representations of its words. We then measure the similarity
    between two documents based on the similarity of their distributions. Experiments
    on eight standard text categorization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
    the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract: In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, a document is commonly
    modeled as a bag of words using the term frequency-inverse document frequency
    (TF-IDF) vector. One major shortcoming of the frequency-based TF-IDF feature vector
    is that it ignores word orders that carry syntactic and semantic relationships
    among the words in a document. This paper proposes a novel distributed vector
    representation of a document, which will be labeled as DV-LSTM, and is derived
    from the result of adapting a long short-term memory recurrent neural network
    language model by the document. DV-LSTM is expected to capture some high-level
    sequential information in the document, which other current document representations
    fail to do. It was evaluated in document genre classification in the Brown Corpus
    and the BNC Baby Corpus. The results show that DV-LSTM significantly outperforms
    TF-IDF vector and paragraph vector (PV-DM) in most cases, and their combinations
    may further improve the classification performance.

  abstract: We introduce a novel method to extract keywords from meeting speech in
    real-time. Our approach builds on the graph-of-words representation of text and
    leverages the k-core decomposition algorithm and properties of submodular functions.
    We outperform multiple baselines in a real-time scenario emulated from the AMI
    and ICSI meeting corpora. Evaluation is conducted against both extractive and
    abstractive gold standard using two standard performance metrics and a newer one
    based on word embeddings.

  abstract: Task-oriented dialogue focuses on conversational agents that participate
    in dialogues with user goals on domain-specific topics. In contrast to chatbots,
    which simply seek to sustain open-ended meaningful discourse, existing task-oriented
    agents usually explicitly model user intent and belief states. This paper examines
    bypassing such an explicit representation by depending on a latent neural embedding
    of state and learning selective attention to dialogue history together with copying
    to incorporate relevant prior context. We complement recent work by showing the
    effectiveness of simple sequence-to-sequence neural architectures with a copy
    mechanism. Our model outperforms more complex memory-augmented models by 7% in
    per-response generation and is on par with the current state-of-the-art on DSTC2,
    a real-world task-oriented dialogue dataset.

  abstract: We explore the problem of translating speech to text in low-resource scenarios
    where neither automatic speech recognition (ASR) nor machine translation (MT)
    are available, but we have training data in the form of audio paired with text
    translations. We present the first system for this problem applied to a realistic
    multi-speaker dataset, the CALLHOME Spanish-English speech translation corpus.
    Our approach uses unsupervised term discovery (UTD) to cluster repeated patterns
    in the audio, creating a pseudotext, which we pair with translations to create
    a parallel text and train a simple bag-of-words MT model. We identify the challenges
    faced by the system, finding that the difficulty of cross-speaker UTD results
    in low recall, but that our system is still able to correctly translate some content
    words in test data.

  abstract: This paper introduces a new unsupervised approach for dialogue act induction.
    Given the sequence of dialogue utterances, the task is to assign them the labels
    representing their function in the dialogue. Utterances are represented as real-valued
    vectors encoding their meaning. We model the dialogue as Hidden Markov model with
    emission probabilities estimated by Gaussian mixtures. We use Gibbs sampling for
    posterior inference. We present the results on the standard Switchboard-DAMSL
    corpus. Our algorithm achieves promising results compared with strong supervised
    baselines and outperforms other unsupervised algorithms.

  abstract: Grounded semantics is typically learnt from utterance-level meaning representations
    (e.g., successful database retrievals, denoted objects in images, moves in a game).
    We explore learning word and utterance meanings by continuous observation of the
    actions of an instruction follower (IF). While an instruction giver (IG) provided
    a verbal description of a configuration of objects, IF recreated it using a GUI.
    Aligning these GUI actions to sub-utterance chunks allows a simple maximum entropy
    model to associate them as chunk meaning better than just providing it with the
    utterance-final configuration. This shows that semantics useful for incremental
    (word-by-word) application, as required in natural dialogue, might also be better
    acquired from incremental settings.

  abstract: 'Distributional word representations are widely used in NLP tasks. These
    representations are based on an assumption that words with a similar context tend
    to have a similar meaning. To improve the quality of the context-based embeddings,
    many researches have explored how to make full use of existing lexical resources.
    In this paper, we argue that while we incorporate the prior knowledge with context-based
    embeddings, words with different occurrences should be treated differently. Therefore,
    we propose to rely on the measurement of information content to control the degree
    of applying prior knowledge into context-based embeddings - different words would
    have different learning rates when adjusting their embeddings. In the result,
    we demonstrate that our embeddings get significant improvements on two different
    tasks: Word Similarity and Analogical Reasoning.'

  abstract: In this paper we present a cross-lingual extension of a neural tensor
    network model for knowledge base completion. We exploit multilingual synsets from
    BabelNet to translate English triples to other languages and then augment the
    reference knowledge base with cross-lingual triples. We project monolingual embeddings
    of different languages to a shared multilingual space and use them for network
    initialization (i.e., as initial concept embeddings). We then train the network
    with triples from the cross-lingually augmented knowledge base. Results on WordNet
    link prediction show that leveraging cross-lingual information yields significant
    gains over exploiting only monolingual triples.

  abstract: One of the key problems in computational metaphor modelling is finding
    the optimal level of abstraction of semantic representations, such that these
    are able to capture and generalise metaphorical mechanisms. In this paper we present
    the first metaphor identification method that uses representations constructed
    from property norms. Such norms have been previously shown to provide a cognitively
    plausible representation of concepts in terms of semantic properties. Our results
    demonstrate that such property-based semantic representations provide a suitable
    model of cross-domain knowledge projection in metaphors, outperforming standard
    distributional models on a metaphor identification task.

  abstract: 'Up to date, the majority of computational models still determines the
    semantic relatedness between words (or larger linguistic units) on the type level.
    In this paper, we compare and extend multi-sense embeddings, in order to model
    and utilise word senses on the token level. We focus on the challenging class
    of complex verbs, and evaluate the model variants on various semantic tasks: semantic
    classification; predicting compositionality; and detecting non-literal language
    usage. While there is no overall best model, all models significantly outperform
    a word2vec single-sense skip baseline, thus demonstrating the need to distinguish
    between word senses in a distributional semantic model.'

  abstract: We present a new approach to extraction of hypernyms based on projection
    learning and word embeddings. In contrast to classification-based approaches,
    projection-based methods require no candidate hyponym-hypernym pairs. While it
    is natural to use both positive and negative training examples in supervised relation
    extraction, the impact of positive examples on hypernym prediction was not studied
    so far. In this paper, we show that explicit negative examples used for regularization
    of the model significantly improve performance compared to the state-of-the-art
    approach of Fu et al. (2014) on three datasets from different languages.

  abstract: Current models for stance classification often treat each target independently,
    but in many applications, there exist natural dependencies among targets, e.g.,
    stance towards two or more politicians in an election or towards several brands
    of the same product. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-target stance
    detection. We present a new dataset that we built for this task. Furthermore,
    We experiment with several neural models on the dataset and show that they are
    more effective in jointly modeling the overall position towards two related targets
    compared to independent predictions and other models of joint learning, such as
    cascading classification. We make the new dataset publicly available, in order
    to facilitate further research in multi-target stance classification.

  abstract: The polarity classification task aims at automatically identifying whether
    a subjective text is positive or negative. When the target domain is different
    from those where a model was trained, we refer to a cross-domain setting. That
    setting usually implies the use of a domain adaptation method. In this work, we
    study the single and cross-domain polarity classification tasks from the string
    kernels perspective. Contrary to classical domain adaptation methods, which employ
    texts from both domains to detect pivot features, we do not use the target domain
    for training. Our approach detects the lexical peculiarities that characterise
    the text polarity and maps them into a domain independent space by means of kernel
    discriminant analysis. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance
    in single and cross-domain polarity classification.

  abstract: "Inferring the emotional content of words is important for text-based\

    \ are expensive to collect at scale and across languages or domains. We develop\
    \ a method that automatically extends word-level ratings to unrated words using\

    \ We use our method to determine a word\u2019s valence and arousal, which determine\
    \ its position on the circumplex model of affect, the most popular dimensional\
    \ model of emotion. Our method achieves superior out-of-sample word rating prediction\
    \ on both affective dimensions across three different languages when compared\
    \ to state-of-the-art word similarity based methods. Our method can assist building\

  abstract: Neural network models have been used for target-dependent sentiment analysis.
    Previous work focus on learning a target specific representation for a given input
    sentence which is used for classification. However, they do not explicitly model
    the contribution of each word in a sentence with respect to targeted sentiment
    polarities. We investigate an attention model to this end. In particular, a vanilla
    LSTM model is used to induce an attention value of the whole sentence. The model
    is further extended to differentiate left and right contexts given a certain target
    following previous work. Results show that by using attention to model the contribution
    of each word with respect to the target, our model gives significantly improved
    results over two standard benchmarks. We report the best accuracy for this task.

  abstract: We investigate the reranking of the output of several distributional approaches
    on the Bilingual Lexicon Induction task. We show that reranking an n-best list
    produced by any of those approaches leads to very substantial improvements. We
    further demonstrate that combining several n-best lists by reranking is an effective
    way of further boosting performance.

  abstract: Phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based (Hiero) translation models
    differ radically in the way reordering is modeled. Lexicalized reordering models
    play an important role in phrase-based MT and such models have been added to CKY-based
    decoders for Hiero. Watanabe et al. (2006) proposed a promising decoding algorithm
    for Hiero (LR-Hiero) that visits input spans in arbitrary order and produces the
    translation in left to right (LR) order which leads to far fewer language model
    calls and leads to a considerable speedup in decoding. We introduce a novel shift-reduce
    algorithm to LR-Hiero to decode with our lexicalized reordering model (LRM) and
    show that it improves translation quality for Czech-English, Chinese-English and
    German-English.

  abstract: The task of unsupervised lexicon induction is to find translation pairs
    across monolingual corpora. We develop a novel method that creates seed lexicons
    by identifying cognates in the vocabularies of related languages on the basis
    of their frequency and lexical similarity. We apply bidirectional bootstrapping
    to a method which learns a linear mapping between context-based vector spaces.
    Experimental results on three language pairs show consistent improvement over
    prior work.

  abstract: 'Many errors in phrase-based SMT can be attributed to problems on three
    linguistic levels: morphological complexity in the target language, structural
    differences and lexical choice. We explore combinations of linguistically motivated
    approaches to address these problems in English-to-German SMT and show that they
    are complementary to one another, but also that the popular verbal pre-ordering
    can cause problems on the morphological and lexical level. A discriminative classifier
    can overcome these problems, in particular when enriching standard lexical features
    with features geared towards verbal inflection.'

  abstract: "We implement a fully probabilistic model to combine the hypotheses of\
    \ a Spanish anaphora resolution system with those of a Spanish-English machine\
    \ translation system. The probabilities over antecedents are converted into probabilities\
    \ for the features of translated pronouns, and are integrated with phrase-based\
    \ MT using an additional translation model for pronouns. The system improves the\
    \ translation of several Spanish personal and possessive pronouns into English,\
    \ by solving translation divergencies such as \u2018ella\u2019 vs. \u2018she\u2019\
    /\u2018it\u2019 or \u2018su\u2019 vs. \u2018his\u2019/\u2018her\u2019/\u2018its\u2019\
    /\u2018their\u2019. On a test set with 2,286 pronouns, a baseline system correctly\
    \ translates 1,055 of them, while ours improves this by 41. Moreover, with oracle\
    \ antecedents, possessives are translated with an accuracy of 83%."

    User-generated product listings often do not constitute grammatical or well-formed

  abstract: Most existing models for multilingual natural language processing (NLP)
    treat language as a discrete category, and make predictions for either one language
    or the other. In contrast, we propose using continuous vector representations
    of language. We show that these can be learned efficiently with a character-based
    neural language model, and used to improve inference about language varieties
    not seen during training. In experiments with 1303 Bible translations into 990
    different languages, we empirically explore the capacity of multilingual language
    models, and also show that the language vectors capture genetic relationships
    between languages.

  abstract: We address for the first time unsupervised training for a translation
    task with hundreds of thousands of vocabulary words. We scale up the expectation-maximization
    (EM) algorithm to learn a large translation table without any parallel text or
    seed lexicon. First, we solve the memory bottleneck and enforce the sparsity with
    a simple thresholding scheme for the lexicon. Second, we initialize the lexicon
    training with word classes, which efficiently boosts the performance. Our methods
    produced promising results on two large-scale unsupervised translation tasks.

  abstract: We propose a variant of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, the
    Attention CNN (ACNN); for large-scale categorization of millions of Japanese items
    into thirty-five product categories. Compared to a state-of-the-art Gradient Boosted
    Tree (GBT) classifier, the proposed model reduces training time from three weeks
    to three days while maintaining more than 96% accuracy. Additionally, our proposed
    model characterizes products by imputing attentive focus on word tokens in a language
    agnostic way. The attention words have been observed to be semantically highly
    correlated with the predicted categories and give us a choice of automatic feature
    extraction for downstream processing.

  abstract: Aspect extraction abstracts the common properties of objects from corpora
    discussing them, such as reviews of products. Recent work on aspect extraction
    is leveraging the hierarchical relationship between products and their categories.
    However, such effort focuses on the aspects of child categories but ignores those
    from parent categories. Hence, we propose an LDA-based generative topic model
    inducing the two-layer categorical information (CAT-LDA), to balance the aspects
    of both a parent category and its child categories. Our hypothesis is that child
    categories inherit aspects from parent categories, controlled by the hierarchy
    between them. Experimental results on 5 categories of Amazon.com products show
    that both common aspects of parent category and the individual aspects of sub-categories
    can be extracted to align well with the common sense. We further evaluate the
    manually extracted aspects of 16 products, resulting in an average hit rate of
    79.10%.

  abstract: 'The majority of approaches to author profiling and author identification
    focus mainly on lexical features, i.e., on the content of a text. We argue that
    syntactic and discourse features play a significantly more prominent role than
    they were given in the past. We show that they achieve state-of-the-art performance
    in author and gender identification on a literary corpus while keeping the feature
    set small: the used feature set is composed of only 188 features and still outperforms
    the winner of the PAN 2014 shared task on author verification in the literary
    genre.'

  abstract: Political text scaling aims to linearly order parties and politicians
    across political dimensions (e.g., left-to-right ideology) based on textual content
    (e.g., politician speeches or party manifestos). Existing models scale texts based
    on relative word usage and cannot be used for cross-lingual analyses. Additionally,
    there is little quantitative evidence that the output of these models correlates
    with common political dimensions like left-to-right orientation. Experimental
    results show that the semantically-informed scaling models better predict the
    party positions than the existing word-based models in two different political
    dimensions. Furthermore, the proposed models exhibit no drop in performance in
    the cross-lingual compared to monolingual setting.

  abstract: Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence
    classification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear,
    and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence classification
    approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly classifying subsequent
    sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In this work, we present an
    ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of typical ANN models to classify
    sentences in isolation, with the strength of structured prediction. Our model
    outperforms the state-of-the-art results on two different datasets for sequential
    sentence classification in medical abstracts.

  abstract: Topics generated by topic models are typically presented as a list of
    topic terms. Automatic topic labelling is the task of generating a succinct label
    that summarises the theme or subject of a topic, with the intention of reducing
    the cognitive load of end-users when interpreting these topics. Traditionally,
    topic label systems focus on a single label modality, e.g. textual labels. In
    this work we propose a multimodal approach to topic labelling using a simple feedforward
    neural network. Given a topic and a candidate image or textual label, our method
    automatically generates a rating for the label, relative to the topic. Experiments
    show that this multimodal approach outperforms single-modality topic labelling
    systems.

  abstract: We focus on named entity recognition (NER) for Chinese social media. With
    massive unlabeled text and quite limited labelled corpus, we propose a semi-supervised
    learning model based on B-LSTM neural network. To take advantage of traditional
    methods in NER such as CRF, we combine transition probability with deep learning
    in our model. To bridge the gap between label accuracy and F-score of NER, we
    construct a model which can be directly trained on F-score. When considering the
    instability of F-score driven method and meaningful information provided by label
    accuracy, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-score and label accuracy.
    Our integrated model yields 7.44% improvement over previous state-of-the-art result.

  abstract: An important asset of using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for text applications
    is their ability to automatically engineering features. Unfortunately, DNNs usually
    require a lot of training data, especially for highly semantic tasks such as community
    Question Answering (cQA). In this paper, we tackle the problem of data scarcity
    by learning the target DNN together with two auxiliary tasks in a multitask learning
    setting. We exploit the strong semantic connection between selection of comments
    relevant to (i) new questions and (ii) forum questions. This enables a global
    representation for comments, new and previous questions. The experiments of our
    model on a SemEval challenge dataset for cQA show a 20% of relative improvement
    over standard DNNs.

  abstract: Many important email-related tasks, such as email classification or search,
    highly rely on building quality document representations (e.g., bag-of-words or
    key phrases) to assist matching and understanding. Despite prior success on representing
    textual messages, creating quality user representations from emails was overlooked.
    In this paper, we propose to represent users using embeddings that are trained
    to reflect the email communication network. Our experiments on Enron dataset suggest
    that the resulting embeddings capture the semantic distance between users. To
    assess the quality of embeddings in a real-world application, we carry out auto-foldering
    task where the lexical representation of an email is enriched with user embedding
    features. Our results show that folder prediction accuracy is improved when embedding
    features are present across multiple settings.

  abstract: "Many of the world\u2019s languages contain an abundance of inflected\
    \ forms for each lexeme. A critical task in processing such languages is predicting\
    \ these inflected forms. We develop a novel statistical model for the problem,\
    \ drawing on graphical modeling techniques and recent advances in deep learning.\
    \ We derive a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to jointly decode the model. Our Bayesian\
    \ network draws inspiration from principal parts morphological analysis. We demonstrate\
    \ improvements on 5 languages."

  abstract: In semantic parsing, natural language questions map to expressions in
    a meaning representation language (MRL) over some fixed vocabulary of predicates.
    To do this reliably, one must guarantee that for a wide class of natural language
    questions (the so called semantically tractable questions), correct interpretations
    are always in the mapped set of possibilities. In this demonstration, we introduce
    the system COVER which significantly clarifies, revises and extends the basic
    notion of semantic tractability. COVER achieves coverage of 89% while the earlier
    PRECISE system achieved coverage of 77% on the well known GeoQuery corpus. Like
    PRECISE, COVER requires only a simple domain lexicon and integrates off-the-shelf
    syntactic parsers. Beyond PRECISE, COVER also integrates off-the-shelf theorem
    provers to provide more accurate results. COVER is written in Python and uses
    the NLTK.

  abstract: Web debates play an important role in enabling broad participation of
    constituencies in social, political and economic decision-taking. However, it
    is challenging to organize, structure, and navigate a vast number of diverse argumentations
    and comments collected from many participants over a long time period. In this
    paper we demonstrate Common Round, a next generation platform for large-scale
    web debates, which provides functions for eliciting the semantic content and structures
    from the contributions of participants. In particular, Common Round applies language
    technologies for the extraction of semantic essence from textual input, aggregation
    of the formulated opinions and arguments. The platform also provides a cross-lingual
    access to debates using machine translation.

  abstract: A frequent type of annotations in text corpora are labeled text segments.
    General-purpose annotation tools tend to be overly comprehensive, often making
    the annotation process slower and more error-prone. We present WAT-SL, a new web-based
    tool that is dedicated to segment labeling and highly customizable to the labeling
    task at hand. We outline its main features and exemplify how we used it for a
    crowdsourced corpus with labeled argument units.

  abstract: "Wikipedia offers researchers unique insights into the collaboration and\
    \ communication patterns of a large self-regulating community of editors. The\
    \ main medium of direct communication between editors of an article is the article\u2019\
    s talk page. However, a talk page file is unstructured and therefore difficult\
    \ to analyse automatically. A few parsers exist that enable its transformation\
    \ into a structured data format. However, they are rarely open source, support\
    \ only a limited subset of the talk page syntax \u2013 resulting in the loss of\
    \ content \u2013 and usually support only one export format. Together with this\
    \ article we offer a very fast, lightweight, open source parser with support for\
    \ various output formats. In a preliminary evaluation it achieved a high accuracy.\
    \ The parser uses a grammar-based approach \u2013 offering a transparent implementation\
    \ and easy extensibility."

  abstract: In the recent years, the amount of user generated contents shared on the
    Web has significantly increased, especially in social media environment, e.g.
    Twitter, Facebook, Google+. This large quantity of data has generated the need
    of reactive and sophisticated systems for capturing and understanding the underlying
    information enclosed in them. In this paper we present TWINE, a real-time system
    for the big data analysis and exploration of information extracted from Twitter
    streams. The proposed system based on a Named Entity Recognition and Linking pipeline
    and a multi-dimensional spatial geo-localization is managed by a scalable and
    flexible architecture for an interactive visualization of micropost streams insights.
    The demo is available at http://twine-mind.cloudapp.net/streaming.

  abstract: Voice enabled human computer interfaces (HCI) that integrate automatic
    speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis and natural language understanding
    have become a commodity, introduced by the immersion of smart phones and other
    gadgets in our daily lives. Smart assistants are able to respond to simple queries
    (similar to text-based question-answering systems), perform simple tasks (call
    a number, reject a call etc.) and help organizing appointments. With this paper
    we introduce a newly created process automation platform that enables the user
    to control applications and home appliances and to query the system for information
    using a natural voice interface. We offer an overview of the technologies that
    enabled us to construct our system and we present different usage scenarios in
    home and office environments.

  abstract: "In this paper we present our automated fact checking system demonstration\
    \ which we developed in order to participate in the Fast and Furious Fact Check\
    \ challenge. We focused on simple numerical claims such as \u201Cpopulation of\
    \ Germany in 2015 was 80 million\u201D which comprised a quarter of the test instances\
    \ in the challenge, achieving 68% accuracy. Our system extends previous work on\
    \ semantic parsing and claim identification to handle temporal expressions and\
    \ knowledge bases consisting of multiple tables, while relying solely on automatically\
    \ generated training data. We demonstrate the extensible nature of our system\
    \ by evaluating it on relations used in previous work. We make our system publicly\
    \ available so that it can be used and extended by the community."

  abstract: Distributing papers into sessions in scientific conferences is a task
    consisting in grouping papers with common topics and considering the size restrictions
    imposed by the conference schedule. This problem can be seen as a semi-supervised
    clustering of scientific papers based on their features. This paper presents a
    web tool called ADoCS that solves the problem of configuring conference schedules
    by an automatic clustering of articles by similarity using a new algorithm considering
    size constraints.

  abstract: This article describes a semantic system which is based on distributional
    models obtained from a chronologically structured language resource, namely Google
    Books Syntactic Ngrams.The models were created using dependency-based contexts
    and a strategy for reducing the vector space, which consists in selecting the
    more informative and relevant word contexts. The system allowslinguists to analize
    meaning change of Spanish words in the written language across time.

  abstract: This paper presents Autobank, a prototype tool for constructing a wide-coverage
    Minimalist Grammar (MG) (Stabler 1997), and semi-automatically converting the
    Penn Treebank (PTB) into a deep Minimalist treebank. The front end of the tool
    is a graphical user interface which facilitates the rapid development of a seed
    set of MG trees via manual reannotation of PTB preterminals with MG lexical categories.
    The system then extracts various dependency mappings between the source and target
    trees, and uses these in concert with a non-statistical MG parser to automatically
    reannotate the rest of the corpus. Autobank thus enables deep treebank conversions
    (and subsequent modifications) without the need for complex transduction algorithms
    accompanied by cascades of ad hoc rules; instead, the locus of human effort falls
    directly on the task of grammar construction itself.

  abstract: We build a chat bot with iterative content exploration that leads a user
    through a personalized knowledge acquisition session. The chat bot is designed
    as an automated customer support or product recommendation agent assisting a user
    in learning product features, product usability, suitability, troubleshooting
    and other related tasks. To control the user navigation through content, we extend
    the notion of a linguistic discourse tree (DT) towards a set of documents with
    multiple sections covering a topic. For a given paragraph, a DT is built by DT
    parsers. We then combine DTs for the paragraphs of documents to form what we call
    extended DT, which is a basis for interactive content exploration facilitated
    by the chat bot. To provide cohesive answers, we use a measure of rhetoric agreement
    between a question and an answer by tree kernel learning of their DTs.

    \ through newspapers monitor corpora. The platform combines state-of-the-art processes\
    \ to track linguistic changes and a web platform for linguists to create and manage\
    \ their corpora, accept or reject automatically identified neologisms, describe\
    \ linguistically the accepted neologisms and follow their lifecycle on the monitor\
    \ corpora. In the following, after a short state-of-the-art in Neologism Retrieval,\
    \ Analysis and Life-tracking, we describe the overall architecture of the system.\
    \ The platform can be freely browsed at www.neoveille.org where detailed presentation\

  abstract: Event Schema Induction is the task of learning a representation of events
    (e.g., bombing) and the roles involved in them (e.g, victim and perpetrator).
    This paper presents InToEventS, an interactive tool for learning these schemas.
    InToEventS allows users to explore a corpus and discover which kind of events
    are present. We show how users can create useful event schemas using two interactive
    clustering steps.

  abstract: Collocation and idiom extraction are well-known challenges with many potential
    applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our experimental, open-source
    software system, called ICE, is a python package for flexibly extracting collocations
    and idioms, currently in English. It also has a competitive POS tagger that can
    be used alone or as part of collocation/idiom extraction. ICE is available free
    of cost for research and educational uses in two user-friendly formats. This paper
    gives an overview of ICE and its performance, and briefly describes the research
    underlying the extraction algorithms.

  abstract: We propose a novel embedding model that represents relationships among
    several elements in bibliographic information with high representation ability
    and flexibility. Based on this model, we present a novel search system that shows
    the relationships among the elements in the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. The
    evaluation results show that our model can achieve a high prediction ability and
    produce reasonable search results.

    of named entities, semantic parsing to detect relationships between entities,
    and automatic construction / augmentation of factual knowledge bases. Implemented

  abstract: This research proposal discusses pragmatic factors in image description,
    arguing that current automatic image description systems do not take these factors
    into account. I present a general model of the human image description process,
    and propose to study this process using corpus analysis, experiments, and computational
    modeling. This will lead to a better characterization of human image description
    behavior, providing a road map for future research in automatic image description,
    and the automatic description of perceptual stimuli in general.

  abstract: "Spelling variation in non-standard language, e.g. computer-mediated communication\
    \ and historical texts, is usually treated as a deviation from a standard spelling,\
    \ e.g. 2mr as an non-standard spelling for tomorrow. Consequently, in normalization\
    \ \u2013 the standard approach of dealing with spelling variation \u2013 so-called\
    \ non-standard words are mapped to their corresponding standard words. However,\
    \ there is not always a corresponding standard word. This can be the case for\
    \ single types (like emoticons in computer-mediated communication) or a complete\
    \ language, e.g. texts from historical languages that did not develop to a standard\
    \ variety. The approach presented in this thesis proposal deals with spelling\
    \ variation in absence of reference to a standard. The task is to detect pairs\
    \ of types that are variants of the same morphological word. An approach for spelling-variant\
    \ detection is presented, where pairs of potential spelling variants are generated\
    \ with Levenshtein distance and subsequently filtered by supervised machine learning.\
    \ The approach is evaluated on historical Low German texts. Finally, further perspectives\
    \ are discussed."

  abstract: Reproducing experiments is an important instrument to validate previous
    work and build upon existing approaches. It has been tackled numerous times in
    different areas of science. In this paper, we introduce an empirical replicability
    study of three well-known algorithms for syntactic centric aspect-based opinion
    mining. We show that reproducing results continues to be a difficult endeavor,
    mainly due to the lack of details regarding preprocessing and parameter setting,
    as well as due to the absence of available implementations that clarify these
    details. We consider these are important threats to validity of the research on
    the field, specifically when compared to other problems in NLP where public datasets
    and code availability are critical validity components. We conclude by encouraging
    code-based research, which we think has a key role in helping researchers to understand
    the meaning of the state-of-the-art better and to generate continuous advances.

  abstract: "Humans are known to detect deception in speech randomly and it is therefore\
    \ important to develop tools to enable them to detect deception. The problem of\
    \ deception detection has been studied for a significant amount of time, however\
    \ the last 10-15 years have seen methods of computational linguistics being employed.\
    \ Texts are processed using different NLP tools and then classified as deceptive/truthful\
    \ using machine learning methods. While most research has been performed for English,\
    \ Slavic languages have never been a focus of detection deception studies. The\
    \ paper deals with deception detection in Russian narratives. It employs a specially\
    \ designed corpus of truthful and deceptive texts on the same topic from each\
    \ respondent, N = 113. The texts were processed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word\
    \ Count software that is used in most studies of text-based deception detection.\
    \ The list of parameters computed using the software was expanded due to the designed\
    \ users\u2019 dictionaries. A variety of text classification methods was employed.\
    \ The accuracy of the model was found to depend on the author\u2019s gender and\
    \ text type (deceptive/truthful)."

  abstract: We present a cognitive computational model of pronoun resolution that
    reproduces the human interpretation preferences of the Subject Assignment Strategy
    and the Parallel Function Strategy. Our model relies on a probabilistic pronoun
    resolution system trained on corpus data. Factors influencing pronoun resolution
    are represented as features weighted by their relative importance. The importance
    the model gives to the preferences is in line with psycholinguistic studies. We
    demonstrate the cognitive plausibility of the model by running it on experimental
    items and simulating antecedent choice and reading times of human participants.
    Our model can be used as a new means to study pronoun resolution, because it captures
    the interaction of preferences.

  abstract: "Headlines play a crucial role in attracting audiences\u2019 attention\
    \ to online artefacts (e.g. news articles, videos, blogs). The ability to carry\
    \ out an automatic, large-scale analysis of headlines is critical to facilitate\
    \ the selection and prioritisation of a large volume of digital content. In journalism\
    \ studies news content has been extensively studied using manually annotated news\
    \ values - factors used implicitly and explicitly when making decisions on the\
    \ selection and prioritisation of news items. This paper presents the first attempt\
    \ at a fully automatic extraction of news values from headline text. The news\
    \ values extraction methods are applied on a large headlines corpus collected\
    \ from The Guardian, and evaluated by comparing it with a manually annotated gold\
    \ standard. A crowdsourcing survey indicates that news values affect people\u2019\
    s decisions to click on a headline, supporting the need for an automatic news\
    \ values detection."

  abstract: We propose a new method in the field of argument analysis in social media
    to determining convincingness of arguments in online debates, following previous
    research by Habernal and Gurevych (2016). Rather than using argument specific
    feature values, we measure feature values relative to the average value in the
    debate, allowing us to determine argument convincingness with fewer features (between
    5 and 35) than normally used for natural language processing tasks. We use a simple
    forward-feeding neural network for this task and achieve an accuracy of 0.77 which
    is comparable to the accuracy obtained using 64k features and a support vector
    machine by Habernal and Gurevych.

  abstract: "Social networks have transformed communication dramatically in recent\
    \ years through the rise of new platforms and the development of a new language\
    \ of communication. This landscape requires new forms to describe and predict\
    \ the behaviour of users in networks. This paper presents an analysis of the frequency\
    \ distribution of hashtag popularity in Twitter conversations. Our objective is\
    \ to determine if these frequency distribution follow some well-known frequency\
    \ distribution that many real-life sets of numerical data satisfy. In particular,\
    \ we study the similarity of frequency distribution of hashtag popularity with\
    \ respect to Zipf\u2019s law, an empirical law referring to the phenomenon that\
    \ many types of data in social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution.\
    \ Additionally, we also analyse Benford\u2019s law, is a special case of Zipf\u2019\
    s law, a common pattern about the frequency distribution of leading digits. In\
    \ order to compute correctly the frequency distribution of hashtag popularity,\
    \ we need to correct many spelling errors that Twitter\u2019s users introduce.\
    \ For this purpose we introduce a new filter to correct hashtag mistake based\
    \ on string distances. The experiments obtained employing datasets of Twitter\
    \ streams generated under controlled conditions show that Benford\u2019s law and\
    \ Zipf\u2019s law can be used to model hashtag frequency distribution."

  abstract: Several methods for automatic essay scoring (AES) for English language
    have been proposed. However, multi-aspect AES systems for other languages are
    unusual. Therefore, we propose a multi-aspect AES system to apply on a dataset
    of Brazilian Portuguese essays, which human experts evaluated according to five
    aspects defined by Brazilian Government to the National Exam to High School Student
    (ENEM). These aspects are skills that student must master and every skill is assessed
    apart from each other. Besides the prediction of each aspect, the feature analysis
    also was performed for each aspect. The AES system proposed employs several features
    already employed by AES systems for English language. Our results show that predictions
    for some aspects performed well with the features we employed, while predictions
    for other aspects performed poorly. Also, it is possible to note the difference
    between the five aspects in the detailed feature analysis we performed. Besides
    these contributions, the eight millions of enrollments every year for ENEM raise
    some challenge issues for future directions in our research.

    \ an MWE in an unsupervised way. It is based on the assumption that words in a\

    \ it is classified as literal, and otherwise as idiomatic. While Sporleder an\

    which characterize different properties of terms based on distributions, and propose
    a new feature class for components of term candidates. By using random forests,
    we infer optimal features which are later used to build decision tree classifiers.
    We evaluate our method using the ACL RD-TEC dataset. We demonstrate the importance
    of the novel feature class for downgrading termhood which exploits properties
    of term components. Furthermore, our classification suggests that the identification
    of reliable term candidates should be performed successively, rather than just
    once.

  abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved new breakthroughs in machine
    translation in recent years. It has dominated recent shared translation tasks
    in machine translation research, and is also being quickly adopted in industry.
    The technical differences between NMT and the previously dominant phrase-based
    statistical approach require that practictioners learn new best practices for
    building MT systems, ranging from different hardware requirements, new techniques
    for handling rare words and monolingual data, to new opportunities in continued
    learning and domain adaptation.This tutorial is aimed at researchers and users
    of machine translation interested in working with NMT. The tutorial will cover
    a basic theoretical introduction to NMT, discuss the components of state-of-the-art
    systems, and provide practical advice for building NMT systems.

  abstract: Imitation learning is a learning paradigm originally developed to learn
    robotic controllers from demonstrations by humans, e.g. autonomous flight from
    pilot demonstrations. Recently, algorithms for structured prediction were proposed
    under this paradigm and have been applied successfully to a number of tasks including
    syntactic dependency parsing, information extraction, coreference resolution,
    dynamic feature selection, semantic parsing and natural language generation. Key
    advantages are the ability to handle large output search spaces and to learn with
    non-decomposable loss functions. Our aim in this tutorial is to have a unified
    presentation of the various imitation algorithms for structure prediction, and
    show how they can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks.All material associated
    with the tutorial will be made available through https://sheffieldnlp.github.io/ImitationLearningTutorialEACL2017/.

  abstract: 'Specialising vector spaces to maximise their content with respect to
    one key property of vector space models (e.g. semantic similarity vs. relatedness
    or lexical entailment) while mitigating others has become an active and attractive
    research topic in representation learning. Such specialised vector spaces support
    different classes of NLP problems. Proposed approaches fall into two broad categories:
    a) Unsupervised methods which learn from raw textual corpora in more sophisticated
    ways (e.g. using context selection, extracting co-occurrence information from
    word patterns, attending over contexts); and b) Knowledge-base driven approaches
    which exploit available resources to encode external information into distributional
    vector spaces, injecting knowledge from semantic lexicons (e.g., WordNet, FrameNet,
    PPDB). In this tutorial, we will introduce researchers to state-of-the-art methods
    for constructing vector spaces specialised for a broad range of downstream NLP
    applications. We will deliver a detailed survey of the proposed methods and discuss
    best practices for intrinsic and application-oriented evaluation of such vector
    spaces.Throughout the tutorial, we will provide running examples reaching beyond
    English as the only (and probably the easiest) use-case language, in order to
    demonstrate the applicability and modelling challenges of current representation
    learning architectures in other languages.'

  abstract: "Making decisions in natural language processing problems often involves\
    \ assigning values to sets of interdependent variables where the expressive dependency\
    \ structure can influence, or even dictate what assignments are possible. This\
    \ setting includes a broad range of structured prediction problems such as semantic\
    \ role labeling, named entity and relation recognition, co-reference resolution,\
    \ dependency parsing and semantic parsing. The setting is also appropriate for\
    \ cases that may require making global decisions that involve multiple components,\
    \ possibly pre-designed or pre-learned, as in event recognition and analysis,\
    \ summarization, paraphrasing, textual entailment and question answering. In all\
    \ these cases, it is natural to formulate the decision problem as a constrained\
    \ optimization problem, with an objective function that is composed of learned\
    \ models, subject to domain or problem specific constraints.Over the last few\
    \ years, starting with a couple of papers written by (Roth & Yih, 2004, 2005),\
    \ dozens of papers have been using the Integer linear programming (ILP) formulation\
    \ developed there, including several award-winning papers (e.g., (Martins, Smith,\
    \ & Xing, 2009; Koo, Rush, Collins, Jaakkola, & Sontag., 2010; Berant, Dagan,\
    \ & Goldberger, 2011)).This tutorial will present the key ingredients of ILP formulations\
    \ of natural language processing problems, aiming at guiding readers through the\
    \ key modeling steps, explaining the learning and inference paradigms and exemplifying\
    \ these by providing examples from the literature. We will cover a range of topics,\
    \ from the theoretical foundations of learning and inference with ILP models,\
    \ to practical modeling guides, to software packages and applications.The goal\
    \ of this tutorial is to introduce the computational framework to broader ACL\
    \ community, motivate it as a generic framework for learning and inference in\
    \ global NLP decision problems, present some of the key theoretical and practical\
    \ issues involved and survey some of the existing applications of it as a way\
    \ to promote further development of the framework and additional applications.\
    \ We will also make connections with some of the \u201Chot\u201D topics in current\
    \ NLP research and show how they can be used within the general framework proposed\
    \ here. The tutorial will thus be useful for many of the senior and junior researchers\
    \ that have interest in global decision problems in NLP, providing a concise overview\
    \ of recent perspectives and research results."

  abstract: "In this tutorial, we introduce a computational framework and modeling\
    \ language (VoxML) for composing multimodal simulations of natural language expressions\
    \ within a 3D simulation environment (VoxSim). We demonstrate how to construct\
    \ voxemes, which are visual object representations of linguistic entities. We\
    \ also show how to compose events and actions over these objects, within a restricted\
    \ domain of dynamics. This gives us the building blocks to simulate narratives\
    \ of multiple events or participate in a multimodal dialogue with synthetic agents\
    \ in the simulation environment. To our knowledge, this is the first time such\
    \ material has been presented as a tutorial within the CL community.This will\
    \ be of relevance to students and researchers interested in modeling actionable\
    \ language, natural language communication with agents and robots, spatial and\
    \ temporal constraint solving through language, referring expression generation,\
    \ embodied cognition, as well as minimal model creation.Multimodal simulation\
    \ of language, particularly motion expressions, brings together a number of existing\
    \ lines of research from the computational linguistic, semantics, robotics, and\
    \ formal logic communities, including action and event representation (Di Eugenio,\
    \ 1991), modeling gestural correlates to NL expressions (Kipp et al., 2007; Neff\
    \ et al., 2008), and action event modeling (Kipper and Palmer, 2000; Yang et al.,\
    \ 2015). We combine an approach to event modeling with a scene generation approach\
    \ akin to those found in work by (Coyne and Sproat, 2001; Siskind, 2011; Chang\
    \ et al., 2015). Mapping natural language expressions through a formal model and\
    \ a dynamic logic interpretation into a visualization of the event described provides\
    \ an environment for grounding concepts and referring expressions that is interpretable\
    \ by both a computer and a human user. This opens a variety of avenues for humans\
    \ to communicate with computerized agents and robots, as in (Matuszek et al.,\
    \ 2013; Lauria et al., 2001), (Forbes et al., 2015), and (Deits et al., 2013;\
    \ Walter et al., 2013; Tellex et al., 2014). Simulation and automatic visualization\
    \ of events from natural language descriptions and supplementary modalities, such\
    \ as gestures, allows humans to use their native capabilities as linguistic and\
    \ visual interpreters to collaborate on tasks with an artificial agent or to put\
    \ semantic intuitions to the test in an environment where user and agent share\
    \ a common context.In previous work (Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2014; Pustejovsky,\
    \ 2013a), we introduced a method for modeling natural language expressions within\
    \ a 3D simulation environment built on top of the game development platform Unity\
    \ (Goldstone, 2009). The goal of that work was to evaluate, through explicit visualizations\
    \ of linguistic input, the semantic presuppositions inherent in the different\
    \ lexical choices of an utterance. This work led to two additional lines of research:\
    \ an explicit encoding for how an object is itself situated relative to its environment;\
    \ and an operational characterization of how an object changes its location or\
    \ how an agent acts on an object over time, e.g., its affordance structure. The\
    \ former has developed into a semantic notion of situational context, called a\
    \ habitat (Pustejovsky, 2013a; McDonald and Pustejovsky, 2014), while the latter\
    \ is addressed by dynamic interpretations of event structure (Pustejovsky and\
    \ Moszkowicz, 2011; Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2016b; Pustejovsky, 2013b).The\
    \ requirements on building a visual simulation from language include several components.\
    \ We require a rich type system for lexical items and their composition, as well\
    \ as a language for modeling the dynamics of events, based on Generative Lexicon\
    \ (GL). Further, a minimal embedding space (MES) for the simulation must be determined.\
    \ This is the 3D region within which the state is configured or the event unfolds.\
    \ Object-based attributes for participants in a situation or event also need to\
    \ be specified; e.g., orientation, relative size, default position or pose, etc.\
    \ The simulation establishes an epistemic condition on the object and event rendering,\
    \ imposing an implicit point of view (POV). Finally, there must be some sort of\
    \ agent-dependent embodiment; this determines the relative scaling of an agent\
    \ and its event participants and their surroundings, as it engages in the environment.In\
    \ order to construct a robust simulation from linguistic input, an event and its\
    \ participants must be embedded within an appropriate minimal embedding space.\
    \ This must sufficiently enclose the event localization, while optionally including\
    \ space enough for a frame of reference for the event (the viewer\xE2\u20AC\u2122\
    s perspective).We first describe the formal multimodal foundations for the modeling\
    \ language, VoxML, which creates a minimal simulation from the linguistic input\
    \ interpreted by the multimodal language, DITL. We then describe VoxSim, the compositional\
    \ modeling and simulation environment, which maps the minimal VoxML model of the\
    \ linguistic utterance to a simulation in Unity. This knowledge includes specification\
    \ of object affordances, e.g., what actions are possible or enabled by use an\
    \ object.VoxML (Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2016b; Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy,\
    \ 2016a) encodes semantic knowledge of real-world objects represented as 3D models,\
    \ and of events and attributes related to and enacted over these objects. VoxML\
    \ goes beyond the limitations of existing 3D visual markup languages by allowing\
    \ for the encoding of a broad range of semantic knowledge that can be exploited\
    \ by a simulation platform such as VoxSim.VoxSim (Krishnaswamy and Pustejovsky,\
    \ 2016a; Krishnaswamy and Pustejovsky, 2016b) uses object and event semantic knowledge\
    \ to generate animated scenes in real time without a complex animation interface.\
    \ It uses the Unity game engine for graphics and I/O processing and takes as input\
    \ a simple natural language utterance. The parsed utterance is semantically interpreted\
    \ and transformed into a hybrid dynamic logic representation (DITL), and used\
    \ to generate a minimal simulation of the event when composed with VoxML knowledge.\
    \ 3D assets and VoxML-modeled nominal objects and events are created with other\
    \ Unity-based tools, and VoxSim uses the entirety of the composed information\
    \ to render a visualization of the described event.The tutorial participants will\
    \ learn how to build simulatable objects, compose dynamic event structures, and\
    \ simulate the events running over the objects. The toolkit consists of object\
    \ and program (event) composers and the runtime environment, which allows for\
    \ the user to directly manipulate the objects, or interact with synthetic agents\
    \ in VoxSim. As a result of this tutorial, the student will acquire the following\
    \ skill set: take a novel object geometry from a library and model it in VoxML;\
    \ apply existing library behaviors (actions or events) to the new VoxML object;\
    \ model attributes of new objects as well as introduce novel attributes; model\
    \ novel behaviors over objects.The tutorial modules will be conducted within a\
    \ build image of the software. Access to libraries will be provided by the instructors.\
    \ No knowledge of 3D modeling or the Unity platform will be required."
