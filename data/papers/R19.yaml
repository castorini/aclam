  abstract: In this paper, we present a relationship extraction based methodology
    for table structure recognition in PDF documents. The proposed deep learning-based
    method takes a bottom-up approach to table recognition in PDF documents. We outline
    the shortcomings of conventional approaches based on heuristics and machine learning-based
    top-down approaches. In this work, we explain how the task of table structure
    recognition can be modeled as a cell relationship extraction task and the importance
    of the bottom-up approach in recognizing the table cells. We use Multilayer Feedforward
    Neural Network for table structure recognition and compare the results of three
    feature sets. To gauge the performance of the proposed method, we prepared a training
    dataset using 250 tables in PDF documents, carefully selecting the table structures
    that are most commonly found in the documents. Our model achieves an overall accuracy
    of 97.95% and an F1-Score of 92.62% on the test dataset.

  abstract: Social media plays a great role in news dissemination which includes good
    and bad news. However, studies show that news, in general, has a significant impact
    on our mental stature and that this influence is more in bad news. An ideal situation
    would be that we have a tool that can help to filter out the type of news we do
    not want to consume. In this paper, we provide the basis for such a tool. In our
    work, we focus on Twitter. We release a manually annotated dataset containing
    6,853 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Each tweet is annotated with
    good and bad labels. We also investigate various machine learning systems and
    features and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset. We also
    perform a comparative analysis with sentiments showing that sentiment alone is
    not enough to distinguish between good and bad news.

  abstract: The quality of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), as a data-driven approach,
    massively depends on quantity, quality, and relevance of the training dataset.
    Such approaches have achieved promising results for bilingually high-resource
    scenarios but are inadequate for low-resource conditions. This paper describes
    a round-trip training approach to bilingual low-resource NMT that takes advantage
    of monolingual datasets to address training data scarcity, thus augmenting translation
    quality. We conduct detailed experiments on Persian-Spanish as a bilingually low-resource
    scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that this competitive approach outperforms
    the baselines.

  abstract: Phrases play a key role in Machine Translation (MT). In this paper, we
    apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model over conventional Phrase-Based Statistical
    MT (PBSMT). The core idea is to use an LSTM encoder-decoder to score the phrase
    table generated by the PBSMT decoder. Given a source sequence, the encoder and
    decoder are jointly trained in order to maximize the conditional probability of
    a target sequence. Analytically, the performance of a PBSMT system is enhanced
    by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by an LSTM encoder-decoder
    as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. We compare the performance
    of the phrase tables in the PBSMT to the performance of the proposed LSTM and
    observe its positive impact on translation quality. We construct a PBSMT model
    using the Moses decoder and enrich the Language Model (LM) utilizing an external
    dataset. We then rank the phrase tables using an LSTM-based encoder-decoder. This
    method produces a gain of up to 3.14 BLEU score on the test set.

  abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is an important task for understanding natural
    languages, where the objective is to analyse propositions expressed by the verb
    and to identify each word that bears a semantic role. It provides an extensive
    dataset to enhance NLP applications such as information retrieval, machine translation,
    information extraction, and question answering. However, creating SRL models are
    difficult. Even in some languages, it is infeasible to create SRL models that
    have predicate-argument structure due to lack of linguistic resources. In this
    paper, we present our method to create an automatic Turkish PropBank by exploiting
    parallel data from the translated sentences of English PropBank. Experiments show
    that our method gives promising results.

    \ Sifting through the revision history of the articles that at some point had\

  abstract: Morphological segmentation of words is the process of dividing a word
    into smaller units called morphemes; it is tricky especially when a morphologically
    rich or polysynthetic language is under question. In this work, we designed and
    evaluated several Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models as well as various
    other machine learning based approaches for the morphological segmentation task.
    We trained our models using annotated segmentation lexicons. To evaluate the effect
    of the training data size on our models, we decided to create a large hand-annotated
    morphologically segmented corpus of Persian words, which is, to the best of our
    knowledge, the first and the only segmentation lexicon for the Persian language.
    In the experimental phase, using the hand-annotated Persian lexicon and two smaller
    similar lexicons for Czech and Finnish languages, we evaluated the effect of the
    training data size, different hyper-parameters settings as well as different RNN-based
    models.

  abstract: Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the task of grouping of occurrences of an
    ambiguous word according to their meaning. In this work, we improve the approach
    to WSI proposed by Amrami and Goldberg (2018) based on clustering of lexical substitutes
    for an ambiguous word in a particular context obtained from neural language models.
    Namely, we propose methods for combining information from left and right context
    and similarity to the ambiguous word, which result in generating more accurate
    substitutes than the original approach. Our simple yet efficient improvement establishes
    a new state-of-the-art on WSI datasets for two languages. Besides, we show improvements
    to the original approach on a lexical substitution dataset.

    of language. This type of analysis can bring to the light not only linguistic
    phenomena related to the shift of word meanings over time, but it can also be
    used to study the impact that societal and cultural trends have on this language
    change. This paper introduces a new resource for performing the diachronic analysis
    of named entities built upon Wikipedia page revisions. This resource enables the
    analysis over time of changes in the relations between entities (concepts), surface
    forms (words), and the contexts surrounding entities and surface forms, by analysing
    the whole history of Wikipedia internal links. We provide some useful use cases
    that prove the impact of this resource on diachronic studies and delineate some
    possible future usage.

  abstract: Building multilingual ontologies is a hard task as ontologies are often
    data-rich resources. We introduce an approach which allows exploiting structured
    lexical semantic knowledge for the ontology building. Given a multilingual lexical
    semantic (non ontological) resource and an ontology model, it allows mining relevant
    semantic knowledge and make the ontology building and enhancement process faster.

  abstract: "Neural machine translation models have little inductive bias, which can\
    \ be a disadvantage in low-resource scenarios. Neural models have to be trained\
    \ on large amounts of data and have been shown to perform poorly when only limited\
    \ data is available. We show that using naive regularization methods, based on\
    \ sentence length, punctuation and word frequencies, to penalize translations\
    \ that are very different from the input sentences, consistently improves the\
    \ translation quality across multiple low-resource languages. We experiment with\
    \ 12 language pairs, varying the training data size between 17k to 230k sentence\
    \ pairs. Our best regularizer achieves an average increase of 1.5 BLEU score and\
    \ 1.0 TER score across all the language pairs. For example, we achieve a BLEU\
    \ score of 26.70 on the IWSLT15 English\u2013Vietnamese translation task simply\
    \ by using relative differences in punctuation as a regularizer."

  abstract: While contextualized embeddings have produced performance breakthroughs
    in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
    has not benefited from them yet. In this paper, we introduce QBERT, a Transformer-based
    architecture for contextualized embeddings which makes use of a co-attentive layer
    to produce more deeply bidirectional representations, better-fitting for the WSD
    task. As a result, we are able to train a WSD system that beats the state of the
    art on the concatenation of all evaluation datasets by over 3 points, also outperforming
    a comparable model using ELMo.

  abstract: In this work, we address the evaluation of distributional semantic models
    trained on smaller, domain-specific texts, specifically, philosophical text. Specifically,
    we inspect the behaviour of models using a pre-trained background space in learning.
    We propose a measure of consistency which can be used as an evaluation metric
    when no in-domain gold-standard data is available. This measure simply computes
    the ability of a model to learn similar embeddings from different parts of some
    homogeneous data. We show that in spite of being a simple evaluation, consistency
    actually depends on various combinations of factors, including the nature of the
    data itself, the model used to train the semantic space, and the frequency of
    the learnt terms, both in the background space and in the in-domain data of interest.

  abstract: Goal-Oriented Chatbots in fields such as customer support, providing certain
    information or general help with bookings or reservations, suffer from low performance
    partly due to the difficulty of obtaining large domain-specific annotated datasets.
    Given that the problem is closely related to the domain of the conversational
    agent and the data belonging to a specific domain is difficult to annotate, there
    have been some attempts at surpassing these challenges such as unsupervised pre-training
    or transfer learning between different domains. A more thorough analysis of the
    transfer learning mechanism is justified by the significant improvement of the
    results demonstrated in the results section. We describe extensive experiments
    using transfer learning and warm-starting techniques with improvements of more
    than 5% in relative percentage of success rate in the majority of cases, and up
    to 10x faster convergence as opposed to training the system without them.

  abstract: We present a novel and effective technique for performing text coherence
    tasks while facilitating deeper insights into the data. Despite obtaining ever-increasing
    task performance, modern deep-learning approaches to NLP tasks often only provide
    users with the final network decision and no additional understanding of the data.
    In this work, we show that a new type of sentence embedding learned through self-supervision
    can be applied effectively to text coherence tasks while serving as a window through
    which deeper understanding of the data can be obtained. To produce these sentence
    embeddings, we train a recurrent neural network to take individual sentences and
    predict their location in a document in the form of a distribution over locations.
    We demonstrate that these embeddings, combined with simple visual heuristics,
    can be used to achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art on multiple
    text coherence tasks, outperforming more complex and specialized approaches. Additionally,
    we demonstrate that these embeddings can provide insights useful to writers for
    improving writing quality and informing document structuring, and assisting readers
    in summarizing and locating information.

  abstract: Parallel sentences provide semantically similar information which can
    vary on a given dimension, such as language or register. Parallel sentences with
    register variation (like expert and non-expert documents) can be exploited for
    the automatic text simplification. The aim of automatic text simplification is
    to better access and understand a given information. In the biomedical field,
    simplification may permit patients to understand medical and health texts. Yet,
    there is currently no such available resources. We propose to exploit comparable
    corpora which are distinguished by their registers (specialized and simplified
    versions) to detect and align parallel sentences. These corpora are in French
    and are related to the biomedical area. Manually created reference data show 0.76
    inter-annotator agreement. Our purpose is to state whether a given pair of specialized
    and simplified sentences is parallel and can be aligned or not. We treat this
    task as binary classification (alignment/non-alignment). We perform experiments
    with a controlled ratio of imbalance and on the highly unbalanced real data. Our
    results show that the method we present here can be used to automatically generate
    a corpus of parallel sentences from our comparable corpus.

  abstract: The ability to produce high-quality publishable material is critical to
    academic success but many Post-Graduate students struggle to learn to do so. While
    recent years have seen an increase in tools designed to provide feedback on aspects
    of writing, one aspect that has so far been neglected is the Related Work section
    of academic research papers. To address this, we have trained a supervised classifier
    on a corpus of 94 Related Work sections and evaluated it against a manually annotated
    gold standard. The classifier uses novel features pertaining to citation types
    and co-reference, along with patterns found from studying Related Works. We show
    that these novel features contribute to classifier performance with performance
    being favourable compared to other similar works that classify author intentions
    and consider feedback for academic writing.

  abstract: In this paper we study the performance of several text vectorization algorithms
    on a diverse collection of 73 publicly available datasets. Traditional sparse
    vectorizers like Tf-Idf and Feature Hashing have been systematically compared
    with the latest state of the art neural word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe,
    FastText and character embeddings like ELMo, Flair. We have carried out an extensive
    analysis of the performance of these vectorizers across different dimensions like
    classification metrics (.i.e. precision, recall, accuracy), dataset-size, and
    imbalanced data (in terms of the distribution of the number of class labels).
    Our experiments reveal that the sparse vectorizers beat the neural word and character
    embedding models on 61 of the 73 datasets by an average margin of 3-5% (in terms
    of macro f1 score) and this performance is consistent across the different dimensions
    of comparison.

  abstract: "We present ARAP-Tweet 2.0, a corpus of 5 million dialectal Arabic tweets\
    \ and 50 million words of about 3000 Twitter users from 17 Arab countries. Compared\
    \ to the first version, the new corpus has significant improvements in terms of\
    \ the data volume and the annotation quality. It is fully balanced with respect\
    \ to dialect, gender, and three age groups: under 25 years, between 25 and 34,\
    \ and 35 years and above. This paper describes the process of creating the corpus\
    \ starting from gathering the dialectal phrases to find the users, to annotating\
    \ their accounts and retrieving their tweets. We also report on the evaluation\
    \ of the annotation quality using the inter-annotator agreement measures which\
    \ were applied to the whole corpus and not just a subset. The obtained results\
    \ were substantial with average Cohen\u2019s Kappa values of 0.99, 0.92, and 0.88\
    \ for the annotation of gender, dialect, and age respectively. We also discuss\
    \ some challenges encountered when developing this corpus.s."

  abstract: In Natural Language Generation systems, personalization strategies - i.e,
    the use of information about a target author to generate text that (more) closely
    resembles human-produced language - have long been applied to improve results.
    The present work addresses one such strategy - namely, the use of Big Five personality
    information about the target author - applied to the case of abstractive text
    summarization using neural sequence-to-sequence models. Initial results suggest
    that having access to personality information does lead to more accurate (or human-like)
    text summaries, and paves the way for more robust systems of this kind.

  abstract: Lack of labelled data in the target domain for training is a common problem
    in domain adaptation. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised
    domain adaptation method that combines projection and self-training based approaches.
    Using the labelled data from the source domain, we first learn a projection that
    maximises the distance among the nearest neighbours with opposite labels in the
    source domain. Next, we project the source domain labelled data using the learnt
    projection and train a classifier for the target class prediction. We then use
    the trained classifier to predict pseudo labels for the target domain unlabelled
    data. Finally, we learn a projection for the target domain as we did for the source
    domain using the pseudo-labelled target domain data, where we maximise the distance
    between nearest neighbours having opposite pseudo labels. Experiments on a standard
    benchmark dataset for domain adaptation show that the proposed method consistently
    outperforms numerous baselines and returns competitive results comparable to that
    of SOTA including self-training, tri-training, and neural adaptations.

  abstract: In this work, we propose to address the detection of negation and speculation,
    and of their scope, in French biomedical documents. It has been indeed observed
    that they play an important role and provide crucial clues for other NLP applications.
    Our methods are based on CRFs and BiLSTM. We reach up to 97.21 % and 91.30 % F-measure
    for the detection of negation and speculation cues, respectively, using CRFs.
    For the computing of scope, we reach up to 90.81 % and 86.73 % F-measure on negation
    and speculation, respectively, using BiLSTM-CRF fed with word embeddings.

  abstract: "In this paper, we propose a new Transformer neural machine translation\
    \ (NMT) model that incorporates dependency relations into self-attention on both\
    \ source and target sides, dependency-based self-attention. The dependency-based\
    \ self-attention is trained to attend to the modifiee for each token under constraints\
    \ based on the dependency relations, inspired by Linguistically-Informed Self-Attention\
    \ (LISA). While LISA is originally proposed for Transformer encoder for semantic\
    \ role labeling, this paper extends LISA to Transformer NMT by masking future\
    \ information on words in the decoder-side dependency-based self-attention. Additionally,\
    \ our dependency-based self-attention operates at sub-word units created by byte\
    \ pair encoding. The experiments show that our model improves 1.0 BLEU points\

  abstract: 'Online media aim for reaching ever bigger audience and for attracting
    ever longer attention span. This competition creates an environment that rewards
    sensational, fake, and toxic news. To help limit their spread and impact, we propose
    and develop a news toxicity detector that can recognize various types of toxic
    content. While previous research primarily focused on English, here we target
    Bulgarian. We created a new dataset by crawling a website that for five years
    has been collecting Bulgarian news articles that were manually categorized into
    eight toxicity groups. Then we trained a multi-class classifier with nine categories:
    eight toxic and one non-toxic. We experimented with different representations
    based on ElMo, BERT, and XLM, as well as with a variety of domain-specific features.
    Due to the small size of our dataset, we created a separate model for each feature
    type, and we ultimately combined these models into a meta-classifier. The evaluation
    results show an accuracy of 59.0% and a macro-F1 score of 39.7%, which represent
    sizable improvements over the majority-class baseline (Acc=30.3%, macro-F1=5.2%).'

  abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to estimating the text document complexity.
    Common readability indices are based on average length of sentences and words.
    In contrast to these methods, we propose to count the number of rare words occurring
    abnormally often in the document. We use the reference corpus of texts and the
    quantile approach in order to determine what words are rare, and what frequencies
    are abnormal. We construct a general text complexity model, which can be adjusted
    for the specific task, and introduce two special models. The experimental design
    is based on a set of thematically similar pairs of Wikipedia articles, labeled
    using crowdsourcing. The experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed
    approach.

    sentence simplification method with respect to two NLP tasks: semantic role labelling
    (SRL) and information extraction (IE). The paper begins with our observation of
    challenges in the intrinsic evaluation of sentence simplification systems, which
    motivates the use of extrinsic evaluation of these systems with respect to other
    NLP tasks. We describe the two NLP systems and the test data used in the extrinsic
    evaluation, and present arguments and evidence motivating the integration of a
    sentence simplification step as a means of improving the accuracy of these systems.
    Our evaluation reveals that their performance is improved by the simplification
    step: the SRL system is better able to assign semantic roles to the majority of
    the arguments of verbs and the IE system is better able to identify fillers for
    all IE template slots.'

  abstract: This paper presents a full procedure for the development of a segmented,
    POS-tagged and chunkparsed corpus of Old Tibetan. As an extremely low-resource
    language, Old Tibetan poses non-trivial problems in every step towards the development
    of a searchable treebank. We demonstrate, however, that a carefully developed,
    semisupervised method of optimising and extending existing tools for Classical
    Tibetan, as well as creating specific ones for Old Tibetan can address these issues.
    We thus also present the first very Tibetan Treebank in a variety of formats to
    facilitate research in the fields of NLP, historical linguistics and Tibetan Studies.

  abstract: In the context of text summarization, texts in the legal domain have peculiarities
    related to their length and to their specialized vocabulary. Recent neural network-based
    approaches can achieve high-quality scores for text summarization. However, these
    approaches have been used mostly for generating very short abstracts for news
    articles. Thus, their applicability to the legal domain remains an open issue.
    In this work, we experimented with ten extractive and four abstractive models
    in a real dataset of legal rulings. These models were compared with an extractive
    baseline based on heuristics to select the most relevant parts of the text. Our
    results show that abstractive approaches significantly outperform extractive methods
    in terms of ROUGE scores.

  abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of entropy as a measure of gap complexity
    in open cloze tests aimed at learners of English. Entropy is used to quantify
    the information content in each gap, which can be used to estimate complexity.
    Our study shows that average gap entropy correlates positively with proficiency
    levels while individual gap entropy can capture contextual complexity. To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised information-theoretical
    approach to evaluating the quality of cloze tests.

  abstract: Given the peculiar structure of songs, applying generic text summarization
    methods to lyrics can lead to the generation of highly redundant and incoherent
    text. In this paper, we propose to enhance state-of-the-art text summarization
    approaches with a method inspired by audio thumbnailing. Instead of searching
    for the thumbnail clues in the audio of the song, we identify equivalent clues
    in the lyrics. We then show how these summaries that take into account the audio
    nature of the lyrics outperform the generic methods according to both an automatic
    evaluation and human judgments.

  abstract: "The Parental Advisory Label (PAL) is a warning label that is placed on\
    \ audio recordings in recognition of profanity or inappropriate references, with\
    \ the intention of alerting parents of material potentially unsuitable for children.\
    \ Since 2015, digital providers \u2013 such as iTunes, Spotify, Amazon Music and\
    \ Deezer \u2013 also follow PAL guidelines and tag such tracks as \u201Cexplicit\u201D\
    . Nowadays, such labelling is carried out mainly manually on voluntary basis,\
    \ with the drawbacks of being time consuming and therefore costly, error prone\
    \ and partly a subjective task. In this paper, we compare automated methods ranging\
    \ from dictionary-based lookup to state-of-the-art deep neural networks to automatically\
    \ detect explicit contents in English lyrics. We show that more complex models\
    \ perform only slightly better on this task, and relying on a qualitative analysis\
    \ of the data, we discuss the inherent hardness and subjectivity of the task."

  abstract: In this paper, we present new methods for language classification which
    put to good use both syntax and fuzzy tools, and are capable of dealing with irrelevant
    linguistic features (i.e. features which should not contribute to the classification)
    and even inconsistent features (which do not make sense for specific languages).
    We introduce a metric distance, based on the generalized Steinhaus transform,
    which allows one to deal jointly with irrelevance and inconsistency. To evaluate
    our methods, we test them on a syntactic data set, due to the linguist G. Longobardi
    and his school. We obtain phylogenetic trees which sometimes outperform the ones
    obtained by Atkinson and Gray.

  abstract: This paper describes a set of tools that offers comprehensive solutions
    for corpus lexicography. The tools perform a range of tasks, including construction
    of corpus lexicon, integrating information from external dictionaries, internal
    analysis of the lexicon, and lexical analysis of the corpus. The set of tools
    is particularly useful for creating dictionaries for under-resourced languages.
    The tools are integrated in a general-purpose software that includes additional
    tools for various research tasks, such as linguistic development analysis. Equipped
    with a user-friendly interface, the described system can be easily incorporated
    in research in a variety of fields.

    The system was constructed to primarily serve as a research tool. It is implemented
    in a general-purpose linguistic software, which allows it to be incorporated in
    a multifaceted linguistic research in essentially any language. The system currently
    relies on two mechanisms to generate phonetic transcriptions from texts: (i) importing

    generation of phonetic word forms based on a set of deterministic linguistic rules.

  abstract: We explore anatomy of answers with respect to which text fragments from
    an answer are worth matching with a question and which should not be matched.
    We apply the Rhetorical Structure Theory to build a discourse tree of an answer
    and select elementary discourse units that are suitable for indexing. Manual rules
    for selection of these discourse units as well as automated classification based
    on web search engine mining are evaluated con-cerning improving search accuracy.
    We form two sets of question-answer pairs for FAQ and community QA search domains
    and use them for evaluation of the proposed indexing methodology, which delivers
    up to 16 percent improvement in search recall.

  abstract: We introduce a concept of a virtual discourse tree to improve question
    answering (Q/A) recall for complex, multi-sentence questions. Augmenting the discourse
    tree of an answer with tree fragments obtained from text corpora playing the role
    of ontology, we obtain on the fly a canonical discourse representation of this
    answer that is independent of the thought structure of a given author. This mechanism
    is critical for finding an answer that is not only relevant in terms of questions
    entities but also in terms of inter-relations between these entities in an answer
    and its style. We evaluate the Q/A system enabled with virtual discourse trees
    and observe a substantial increase of performance answering complex questions
    such as Yahoo! Answers and www.2carpros.com.

  abstract: "Every day, the emotion and opinion of different people across the world\
    \ are reflected in the form of short messages using microblogging platforms. Despite\
    \ the existence of enormous potential introduced by this data source, the Twitter\
    \ community is still ambiguous and is not fully explored yet. While there are\
    \ a huge number of studies examining the possibilities of inferring gender and\
    \ age, there exist hardly researches on socioeconomic status (SES) inference of\
    \ Twitter users. As socioeconomic status is essential to treating diverse questions\
    \ linked to human behavior in several fields (sociology, demography, public health,\
    \ etc.), we conducted a comprehensive literature review of SES studies, inference\
    \ methods, and metrics. With reference to the research on literature\u2019s results,\
    \ we came to outline the most critical challenges for researchers. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, this paper is the first review that introduces the different\
    \ aspects of SES inference. Indeed, this article provides the benefits for practitioners\
    \ who aim to process and explore Twitter SES inference."

  abstract: 'Proposition extraction from sentences is an important task for information
    extraction systems Evaluation of such systems usually conflates two aspects: splitting
    complex sentences into clauses and the extraction of propositions. It is thus
    difficult to independently determine the quality of the proposition extraction
    step. We create a manually annotated proposition dataset from sentences taken
    from restaurant reviews that distinguishes between clauses that need to be split
    and those that do not. The resulting proposition evaluation dataset allows us
    to independently compare the performance of proposition extraction systems on
    simple and complex clauses. Although performance drastically drops on more complex
    sentences, we show that the same systems perform best on both simple and complex
    clauses. Furthermore, we show that specific kinds of subordinate clauses pose
    difficulties to most systems.'

  abstract: The study explores application of a simple Convolutional Neural Network
    for the problem of authorship attribution of tweets written in Polish. In our
    solution we use two-step compression of tweets using Byte Pair Encoding algorithm
    and vectorisation as an input to the distributional model generated for the large
    corpus of Polish tweets by word2vec algorithm. Our method achieves results comparable
    to the state-of-the-art approaches for the similar task on English tweets and
    expresses a very good performance in the classification of Polish tweets. We tested
    the proposed method in relation to the number of authors and tweets per author.
    We also juxtaposed results for authors with different topic backgrounds against
    each other.

  abstract: We present a novel approach to automatic question answering that does
    not depend on the performance of an information retrieval (IR) system and does
    not require that the training data come from the same source as the questions.
    We evaluate the system performance on a challenging set of university-level medical
    science multiple-choice questions. Best performance is achieved when combining
    a neural approach with an IR approach, both of which work independently. Unlike
    previous approaches, the system achieves statistically significant improvement
    over the random guess baseline even for questions that are labeled as challenging
    based on the performance of baseline solvers.

  abstract: 'Since deep learning became a key player in natural language processing
    (NLP), many deep learning models have been showing remarkable performances in
    a variety of NLP tasks. Such high performance can be explained by efficient knowledge
    representation of deep learning models. Knowledge distillation from pretrained
    deep networks suggests that we can use more information from the soft target probability
    to train other neural networks. In this paper, we propose a self-knowledge distillation
    method, based on the soft target probabilities of the training model itself, where
    multimode information is distilled from the word embedding space right below the
    softmax layer. Due to the time complexity, our method approximates the soft target
    probabilities. In experiments, we applied the proposed method to two different
    and fundamental NLP tasks: language model and neural machine translation. The
    experiment results show that our proposed method improves performance on the tasks.'

  abstract: A great deal of historical corpora suffer from errors introduced by the
    OCR (optical character recognition) methods used in the digitization process.
    Correcting these errors manually is a time-consuming process and a great part
    of the automatic approaches have been relying on rules or supervised machine learning.
    We present a fully automatic unsupervised way of extracting parallel data for
    training a character-based sequence-to-sequence NMT (neural machine translation)
    model to conduct OCR error correction.

  abstract: "Recently, reading comprehension models achieved near-human performance\
    \ on large-scale datasets such as SQuAD, CoQA, MS Macro, RACE, etc. This is largely\
    \ due to the release of pre-trained contextualized representations such as BERT\
    \ and ELMo, which can be fine-tuned for the target task. Despite those advances\
    \ and the creation of more challenging datasets, most of the work is still done\
    \ for English. Here, we study the effectiveness of multilingual BERT fine-tuned\
    \ on large-scale English datasets for reading comprehension (e.g., for RACE),\
    \ and we apply it to Bulgarian multiple-choice reading comprehension. We propose\
    \ a new dataset containing 2,221 questions from matriculation exams for twelfth\
    \ grade in various subjects \u2014history, biology, geography and philosophy\u2014\
    , and 412 additional questions from online quizzes in history. While the quiz\
    \ authors gave no relevant context, we incorporate knowledge from Wikipedia, retrieving\
    \ documents matching the combination of question + each answer option. Moreover,\
    \ we experiment with different indexing and pre-training strategies. The evaluation\

  abstract: Word embeddings are established as very effective models used in several
    NLP applications. If they differ in their architecture and training process, they
    often exhibit similar properties and remain vector space models with continuously-valued
    dimensions describing the observed data. The complexity resides in the developed
    strategies for learning the values within each dimensional space. In this paper,
    we introduce the concept of disruption which we define as a side effect of the
    training process of embedding models. Disruptions are viewed as a set of embedding
    values that are more likely to be noise than effective descriptive features. We
    show that dealing with disruption phenomenon is of a great benefit to bottom-up
    sentence embedding representation. By contrasting several in-domain and pre-trained
    embedding models, we propose two simple but very effective tweaking techniques
    that yield strong empirical improvements on textual similarity task.

  abstract: Word embedding models are now widely used in most NLP applications. Despite
    their effectiveness, there is no clear evidence about the choice of the most appropriate
    model. It often depends on the nature of the task and on the quality and size
    of the used data sets. This remains true for bottom-up sentence embedding models.
    However, no straightforward investigation has been conducted so far. In this paper,
    we propose a systematic study of the impact of the main word embedding models
    on sentence representation. By contrasting in-domain and pre-trained embedding
    models, we show under which conditions they can be jointly used for bottom-up
    sentence embeddings. Finally, we propose the first bottom-up meta-embedding representation
    at the sentence level for textual similarity. Significant improvements are observed
    in several tasks including question-to-question similarity, paraphrasing and next
    utterance ranking.

  abstract: Researchers use wordnets as a knowledge base in many natural language
    processing tasks and applications, such as question answering, textual entailment,
    discourse classification, and so forth. Lexico-semantic relations among words
    or concepts are important parts of knowledge encoded in wordnets. As the use of
    wordnets becomes extensively widespread, extending the existing ones gets more
    attention. Manually construction and extension of lexico-semantic relations for
    WordNets or knowledge graphs are very time-consuming. Using automatic relation
    extraction methods can speed up this process. In this study, we exploit an ensemble
    of lstm and convolutional neural networks in a supervised manner to capture lexico-semantic
    relations which can either be used directly in NLP applications or compose the
    edges of wordnets. The whole procedure of learning vector space representation
    of relations is language independent. We used Princeton WordNet 3.1, FarsNet 3.0
    (the Persian wordnet), Root09 and EVALution as golden standards to evaluate the
    predictive performance of our model and the results are comparable on the two
    languages. Empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state
    of the art models.

  abstract: Recently research in opinions summarization focuses on rating expressions
    by aspects and/or sentiments they carry. To extract aspects of an expression,
    most studies require a predefined list of aspects or at least the number of aspects.
    Instead of extracting aspects, we rate expressions by aspect similarity recognition
    (ASR), which evaluates whether two expressions share at least one aspect. This
    subtask relaxes the limitation of predefining aspects and makes our opinions summarization
    applicable in domain adaptation. For the ASR subtask, we propose an attention-cell
    LSTM model, which integrates attention signals into the LSTM gates. According
    to the experimental results, the attention-cell LSTM works efficiently for learning
    latent aspects between two sentences in both settings of in-domain and cross-domain.
    In addition, the proposed extractive summarization method using ASR shows significant
    improvements over baselines on the Opinosis corpus.

  abstract: Discourse relations between sentences are often represented as a tree,
    and the tree structure provides important information for summarizers to create
    a short and coherent summary. However, current neural network-based summarizers
    treat the source document as just a sequence of sentences and ignore the tree-like
    discourse structure inherent in the document. To incorporate the information of
    a discourse tree structure into the neural network-based summarizers, we propose
    a discourse-aware neural extractive summarizer which can explicitly take into
    account the discourse dependency tree structure of the source document. Our discourse-aware
    summarizer can jointly learn the discourse structure and the salience score of
    a sentence by using novel hierarchical attention modules, which can be trained
    on automatically parsed discourse dependency trees. Experimental results showed
    that our model achieved competitive or better performances against state-of-the-art
    models in terms of ROUGE scores on the DailyMail dataset. We further conducted
    manual evaluations. The results showed that our approach also gained the coherence
    of the output summaries.

  abstract: "We approach the problem of POS tagging of morphologically rich languages\
    \ in a setting where only a small amount of labeled training data is available.\
    \ We show that a bigram HMM tagger benefits from re-training on a larger untagged\
    \ text using Baum-Welch estimation. Most importantly, this estimation can be significantly\
    \ improved by pre-guessing tags for OOV words based on morphological criteria.\
    \ We consider two models for this task: a character-based recurrent neural network,\
    \ which guesses the tag from the string form of the word, and a recently proposed\
    \ graph-based model of morphological transformations. In the latter, the unknown\
    \ POS tags can be modeled as latent variables in a way very similar to Hidden\
    \ Markov Tree models and an analogue of the Forward-Backward algorithm can be\
    \ formulated, which enables us to compute expected values over unknown taggings.\
    \ We evaluate both the quality of the induced tag lexicon and its impact on the\
    \ HMM\u2019s tagging accuracy. In both tasks, the graph-based morphology model\
    \ performs significantly better than the RNN predictor. This confirms the intuition\
    \ that morphologically related words provide useful information about an unknown\
    \ word\u2019s POS tag."

  abstract: "Word Sense Disambiguation remains a challenging NLP task. Due to the\
    \ lack of annotated training data, especially for rare senses, the supervised\
    \ approaches are usually designed for specific subdomains limited to a narrow\
    \ subset of identified senses. Recent advances in this area have shown that knowledge-based\
    \ approaches are more scalable and obtain more promising results in all-words\
    \ WSD scenarios. In this work we present a faster WSD algorithm based on the Monte\
    \ Carlo approximation of sense probabilities given a context using constrained\
    \ random walks over linked semantic networks. We show that the local semantic\
    \ relatedness is mostly sufficient to successfully identify correct senses when\
    \ an extensive knowledge base and a proper weighting scheme are used. The proposed\
    \ methods are evaluated on English (SenseEval, SemEval) and Polish (Sk\u0142adnica,\
    \ KPWr) datasets."

  abstract: Extracting features and writing styles from short text messages is always
    a challenge. Short messages, like tweets, do not have enough data to perform statistical
    authorship attribution. Besides, the vocabulary used in these texts is sometimes
    improvised or misspelled. Therefore, in this paper, we propose combining four
    feature extraction techniques namely character n-grams, word n-grams, Flexible
    Patterns and a new sub-word embedding using the skip-gram model. Our system uses
    a Multi-Layer Perceptron to utilize these features from tweets to analyze short
    text messages. This proposed system achieves 85% accuracy, which is a considerable
    improvement over previous systems.

  abstract: This paper describes a novel, syntax-based system for automatic detection
    and resolution of Noun Phrase Ellipsis (NPE) in English. The system takes in free
    input English text, detects the site of nominal elision, and if present, selects
    potential antecedent candidates. The rules are built using the syntactic information
    on ellipsis and its antecedent discussed in previous theoretical linguistics literature
    on NPE. Additionally, we prepare a curated dataset of 337 sentences from well-known,
    reliable sources, containing positive and negative samples of NPE. We split this
    dataset into two parts, and use one part to refine our rules and the other to
    test the performance of our final system. We get an F1-score of 76.47% for detection
    and 70.27% for NPE resolution on the testset. To the best of our knowledge, ours
    is the first system that detects and resolves NPE in English. The curated dataset
    used for this task, albeit small, covers a wide variety of NPE cases and will
    be made public for future work.

  abstract: Researchers in Computational Linguistics build models of similarity and
    test them against human judgments. Although there are many empirical studies of
    the computational models of similarity for the English language, the similarity
    for other languages is less explored. In this study we are chiefly interested
    in two aspects. In the first place we want to know how much of the human similarity
    is grounded in the visual perception. To answer this question two neural computer
    vision models are used and their correlation with the human derived similarity
    scores is computed. In the second place we investigate if language influences
    the similarity computation. To this purpose diverse computational models trained
    on Estonian resources are evaluated against human judgments

  abstract: In this paper we address the problem of detecting Twitter bots. We analyze
    a dataset of 8385 Twitter accounts and their tweets consisting of both humans
    and different kinds of bots. We use this data to train machine learning classifiers
    that distinguish between real and bot accounts. We identify features that are
    easy to extract while still providing good results. We analyze different feature
    groups based on account specific, tweet specific and behavioral specific features
    and measure their performance compared to other state of the art bot detection
    methods. For easy future portability of our work we focus on language-agnostic
    features. With AdaBoost, the best performing classifier, we achieve an accuracy
    of 0.988 and an AUC of 0.995. As the creation of good training data in machine
    learning is often difficult - especially in the domain of Twitter bot detection
    - we additionally analyze to what extent smaller amounts of training data lead
    to useful results by reviewing cross-validated learning curves. Our results indicate
    that using few but expressive features already has a good practical benefit for
    bot detection, especially if only a small amount of training data is available.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present a new approach for the evaluation, error analysis,
    and interpretation of supervised and unsupervised Paraphrase Identification (PI)
    systems. Our evaluation framework makes use of a PI corpus annotated with linguistic
    phenomena to provide a better understanding and interpretation of the performance
    of various PI systems. Our approach allows for a qualitative evaluation and comparison
    of the PI models using human interpretable categories. It does not require modification
    of the training objective of the systems and does not place additional burden
    on the developers. We replicate several popular supervised and unsupervised PI
    systems. Using our evaluation framework we show that: 1) Each system performs
    differently with respect to a set of linguistic phenomena and makes qualitatively
    different kinds of errors; 2) Some linguistic phenomena are more challenging than
    others across all systems.'

  abstract: Machine Translation systems have drastically improved over the years for
    several language pairs. Monolingual data is often used to generate synthetic sentences
    to augment the training data which has shown to improve the performance of machine
    translation models. In our paper, we make use of an Unsupervised Statistical Machine
    Translation (USMT) to generate synthetic sentences. Our study compares the performance
    improvements in Neural Machine Translation model when using synthetic sentences
    from supervised and unsupervised Machine Translation models. Our approach of using
    USMT for backtranslation shows promise in low resource conditions and achieves
    an improvement of 3.2 BLEU score over the Neural Machine Translation model.

  abstract: 'The paper describes a computational approach to produce functionally
    comparable monolingual corpus resources for translation studies and contrastive
    analysis. We exploit a text-external approach, based on a set of Functional Text
    Dimensions to model text functions, so that each text can be represented as a
    vector in a multidimensional space of text functions. These vectors can be used
    to find reasonably homogeneous subsets of functionally similar texts across different
    corpora. Our models for predicting text functions are based on recurrent neural
    networks and traditional feature-based machine learning approaches. In addition
    to using the categories of the British National Corpus as our test case, we investigated
    the functional comparability of the English parts from the two parallel corpora:
    CroCo (English-German) and RusLTC (English-Russian) and applied our models to
    define functionally similar clusters in them. Our results show that the Functional
    Text Dimensions provide a useful description for text categories, while allowing
    a more flexible representation for texts with hybrid functions.'

  abstract: Community Question Answering forums are popular among Internet users,
    and a basic problem they encounter is trying to find out if their question has
    already been posed before. To address this issue, NLP researchers have developed
    methods to automatically detect question-similarity, which was one of the shared
    tasks in SemEval. The best performing systems for this task made use of Syntactic
    Tree Kernels or the SoftCosine metric. However, it remains unclear why these methods
    seem to work, whether their performance can be improved by better preprocessing
    methods and what kinds of errors they (and other methods) make. In this paper,
    we therefore systematically combine and compare these two approaches with the
    more traditional BM25 and translation-based models. Moreover, we analyze the impact
    of preprocessing steps (lowercasing, suppression of punctuation and stop words
    removal) and word meaning similarity based on different distributions (word translation
    probability, Word2Vec, fastText and ELMo) on the performance of the task. We conduct
    an error analysis to gain insight into the differences in performance between
    the system set-ups. The implementation is made publicly available from https://github.com/fkunneman/DiscoSumo/tree/master/ranlp.

  abstract: 'This paper presents proof-of-concept experiments for combining orthographic
    and semantic information to distinguish cognates from non-cognates. To this end,
    a context-independent gold standard is developed by manually labelling English-Dutch
    pairs of cognates and false friends in bilingual term lists. These annotated cognate
    pairs are then used to train and evaluate a supervised binary classification system
    for the automatic detection of cognates. Two types of information sources are
    incorporated in the classifier: fifteen string similarity metrics capture form
    similarity between source and target words, while word embeddings model semantic
    similarity between the words. The experimental results show that even though the
    system already achieves good results by only incorporating orthographic information,
    the performance further improves by including semantic information in the form
    of embeddings.'

  abstract: In this paper we give in detail how a resource rich language can be used
    for resolving pronouns for a less resource language. The source language, which
    is resource rich language in this study, is Tamil and the resource poor language
    is Malayalam, both belonging to the same language family, Dravidian. The Pronominal
    resolution developed for Tamil uses CRFs. Our approach is to leverage the Tamil
    language model to test Malayalam data and the processing required for Malayalam
    data is detailed. The similarity at the syntactic level between the languages
    is exploited in identifying the features for developing the Tamil language model.
    The word form or the lexical item is not considered as a feature for training
    the CRFs. Evaluation on Malayalam Wikipedia data shows that our approach is correct
    and the results, though not as good as Tamil, but comparable.

  abstract: "We build the first full pipeline for semantic role labelling of Russian\
    \ texts. The pipeline implements predicate identification, argument extraction,\
    \ argument classification (labeling), and global scoring via integer linear programming.\
    \ We train supervised neural network models for argument classification using\
    \ Russian semantically annotated corpus \u2013 FrameBank. However, we note that\
    \ this resource provides annotations only to a very limited set of predicates.\
    \ We combat the problem of annotation scarcity by introducing two models that\
    \ rely on different sets of features: one for \u201Cknown\u201D predicates that\
    \ are present in the training set and one for \u201Cunknown\u201D predicates that\
    \ are not. We show that the model for \u201Cunknown\u201D predicates can alleviate\
    \ the lack of annotation by using pretrained embeddings. We perform experiments\
    \ with various types of embeddings including the ones generated by deep pretrained\
    \ language models: word2vec, FastText, ELMo, BERT, and show that embeddings generated\
    \ by deep pretrained language models are superior to classical shallow embeddings\

  abstract: This paper outlines procedures for enhancing WordNet with conceptual information
    from FrameNet. The mapping of the two resources is non-trivial. We define a number
    of techniques for the validation of the consistency of the mapping and the extension
    of its coverage which make use of the structure of both resources and the systematic
    relations between synsets in WordNet and between frames in FrameNet, as well as
    between synsets and frames). We present a case study on causativity, a relation
    which provides enhancement complementary to the one using hierarchical relations,
    by means of linking in a systematic way large parts of the lexicon. We show how
    consistency checks and denser relations may be implemented on the basis of this
    relation. We, then, propose new frames based on causative-inchoative correspondences
    and in conclusion touch on the possibilities for defining new frames based on
    the types of specialisation that takes place from parent to child synset.

  abstract: Language is used to describe concepts, and many of these concepts are
    hierarchical. Moreover, this hierarchy should be compatible with forming phrases
    and sentences. We use linear-algebraic methods that allow us to encode words as
    collections of vectors. The representations we use have an ordering, related to
    subspace inclusion, which we interpret as modelling hierarchical information.
    The word representations built can be understood within a compositional distributional
    semantic framework, providing methods for composing words to form phrase and sentence
    level representations. We show that the resulting representations give competitive
    results on both word-level hyponymy and sentence-level entailment datasets.

  abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) consists in detecting and classifying semantic
    relations between entities in a sentence. The vast majority of the state-of-the-art
    RE systems relies on morphosyntactic features and supervised machine learning
    algorithms. This paper tries to answer important questions concerning both the
    impact of semantic based features, and the integration of external linguistic
    knowledge resources on RE performance. For that, a RE system based on a logical
    and relational learning algorithm was used and evaluated on three reference datasets
    from two distinct domains. The yielded results confirm that the classifiers induced
    using the proposed richer feature set outperformed the classifiers built with
    morphosyntactic features in average 4% (F1-measure).

  abstract: "Mental health is one of the main concerns of today\u2019s society. Early\
    \ detection of symptoms can greatly help people with mental disorders. People\
    \ are using social networks more and more to express emotions, sentiments and\
    \ mental states. Thus, the treatment of this information using NLP technologies\
    \ can be applied to the automatic detection of mental problems such as eating\
    \ disorders. However, the first step to solving the problem should be to provide\
    \ a corpus in order to evaluate our systems. In this paper, we specifically focus\
    \ on detecting anorexia messages on Twitter. Firstly, we have generated a new\
    \ corpus of tweets extracted from different accounts including anorexia and non-anorexia\
    \ messages in Spanish. The corpus is called SAD: Spanish Anorexia Detection corpus.\
    \ In order to validate the effectiveness of the SAD corpus, we also propose several\
    \ machine learning approaches for automatically detecting anorexia symptoms in\
    \ the corpus. The good results obtained show that the application of textual classification\
    \ methods is a promising option for developing this kind of system demonstrating\
    \ that these tools could be used by professionals to help in the early detection\

  abstract: In this paper, we present our work on developing a vocabulary trainer
    that uses exercises generated from language resources such as ConceptNet and crowdsources
    the responses of the learners to enrich the language resource. We performed an
    empirical evaluation of our approach with 60 non-native speakers over two days,
    which shows that new entries to expand Concept-Net can efficiently be gathered
    through vocabulary exercises on word relations. We also report on the feedback
    gathered from the users and an expert from language teaching, and discuss the
    potential of the vocabulary trainer application from the user and language learner
    perspective. The feedback suggests that v-trel has educational potential, while
    in its current state some shortcomings could be identified.

  abstract: End-to-end neural approaches are becoming increasingly common in conversational
    scenarios due to their promising performances when provided with sufficient amount
    of data. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to address the interpretability
    of neural approaches in such scenarios by creating challenge datasets using dialogue
    self-play over multiple tasks/intents. Dialogue self-play allows generating large
    amount of synthetic data; by taking advantage of the complete control over the
    generation process, we show how neural approaches can be evaluated in terms of
    unseen dialogue patterns. We propose several out-of-pattern test cases each of
    which introduces a natural and unexpected user utterance phenomenon. As a proof
    of concept, we built a single and a multiple memory network, and show that these
    two architectures have diverse performances depending on the peculiar dialogue
    patterns.

  abstract: Text classification field of natural language processing has been experiencing
    remarkable growth in recent years. Especially, sentiment analysis has received
    a considerable attention from both industry and research community. However, only
    a few research examples exist for Azerbaijani language. The main objective of
    this research is to apply various machine learning algorithms for determining
    the sentiment of news articles in Azerbaijani language. Approximately, 30.000
    social news articles have been collected from online news sites and labeled manually
    as negative or positive according to their sentiment categories. Initially, text
    preprocessing was implemented to data in order to eliminate the noise. Secondly,
    to convert text to a more machine-readable form, BOW (bag of words) model has
    been applied. More specifically, two methodologies of BOW model, which are tf-idf
    and frequency based model have been used as vectorization methods. Additionally,
    SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms have been applied as the classification
    algorithms, and their combinations with two vectorization approaches have been
    tested and analyzed. Experimental results indicate that SVM outperforms other
    classification algorithms.

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the process of creating a statistical Language
    Model (LM) for the Tunisian Dialect. Indeed, this work is part of the realization
    of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for the Tunisian Railway Transport
    Network. Since our eld of work has been limited, there are several words with
    similar behaviors (semantic for example) but they do not have the same appearance
    probability; their class groupings will therefore be possible. For these reasons,
    we propose to build an n-class LM that is based mainly on the integration of purely
    semantic data. Indeed, each class represents an abstraction of similar labels.
    In order to improve the sequence labeling task, we proposed to use a discriminative
    algorithm based on the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. To better judge our
    choice of creating an n-class word model, we compared the created model with the
    3-gram type model on the same test corpus of evaluation. Additionally, to assess
    the impact of using the CRF model to perform the semantic labelling task in order
    to construct semantic classes, we compared the n-class created model with using
    the CRF in the semantic labelling task and the n- class model without using the
    CRF in the semantic labelling task. The drawn comparison of the predictive power
    of the n-class model obtained by applying the CRF model in the semantic labelling
    is that it is better than the other two models presenting the highest value of
    its perplexity.

  abstract: The absence of diacritical marks in the Arabic texts generally leads to
    morphological, syntactic and semantic ambiguities. This can be more blatant when
    one deals with under-resourced languages, such as the Tunisian dialect, which
    suffers from unavailability of basic tools and linguistic resources, like sufficient
    amount of corpora, multilingual dictionaries, morphological and syntactic analyzers.
    Thus, this language processing faces greater challenges due to the lack of these
    resources. The automatic diacritization of MSA text is one of the various complex
    problems that can be solved by deep neural networks today. Since the Tunisian
    dialect is an under-resourced language of MSA and as there are a lot of resemblance
    between both languages, we suggest to investigate a recurrent neural network (RNN)
    for this dialect diacritization problem. This model will be compared to our previous
    models models CRF and SMT (CITATION) based on the same dialect corpus. We can
    experimentally show that our model can achieve better outcomes (DER of 10.72%),
    as compared to the two models CRF (DER of 20.25%) and SMT (DER of 33.15%).

  abstract: 'One of the main characteristics of social media data is the use of non-standard
    language. Since NLP tools have been trained on traditional text material their
    performance drops when applied to social media data. One way to overcome this
    is to first perform text normalization. In this work, we apply text normalization
    to noisy English and Dutch text coming from different social media genres: text
    messages, message board posts and tweets. We consider the normalization task as
    a Machine Translation problem and test the two leading paradigms: statistical
    and neural machine translation. For SMT we explore the added value of varying
    background corpora for training the language model. For NMT we have a look at
    data augmentation since the parallel datasets we are working with are limited
    in size. Our results reveal that when relying on SMT to perform the normalization
    it is beneficial to use a background corpus that is close to the genre you are
    normalizing. Regarding NMT, we find that the translations - or normalizations
    - coming out of this model are far from perfect and that for a low-resource language
    like Dutch adding additional training data works better than artificially augmenting
    the data.'

  abstract: Fake reviews are increasingly prevalent across the Internet. They can
    be unethical as well as harmful. They can affect businesses and mislead individual
    customers. As the opinions on the Web are increasingly used the detection of fake
    reviews has become more and more critical. In this study, we explore the effectiveness
    of sentiment and emotions based representations for the task of building machine
    learning models for fake review detection. We perform empirical studies over three
    real world datasets and demonstrate that improved data representation can be achieved
    by combining sentiment and emotion extraction methods, as well as by performing
    sentiment and emotion analysis on a part-by-part basis by segmenting the reviews.

  abstract: "While high quality gold standard annotated corpora are crucial for most\
    \ tasks in natural language processing, many annotated corpora published in recent\
    \ years, created by annotators or tools, contains noisy annotations. These corpora\
    \ can be viewed as more silver than gold standards, even if they are used in evaluation\
    \ campaigns or to compare systems\u2019 performances. As upgrading a silver corpus\
    \ to gold level is still a challenge, we explore the application of active learning\
    \ techniques to detect errors using four datasets designed for document classification\
    \ and part-of-speech tagging. Our results show that the proposed method for the\
    \ seeding step improves the chance of finding incorrect annotations by a factor\
    \ of 2.73 when compared to random selection, a 14.71% increase from the baseline\
    \ methods. Our query method provides an increase in the error detection precision\
    \ on average by a factor of 1.78 against random selection, an increase of 61.82%\
    \ compared to other query approaches."

  abstract: "With recent efforts in drawing attention to the task of replicating and/or\
    \ reproducing results, for example in the context of COLING 2018 and various LREC\
    \ workshops, the question arises how the NLP community views the topic of replicability\
    \ in general. Using a survey, in which we involve members of the NLP community,\
    \ we investigate how our community perceives this topic, its relevance and options\
    \ for improvement. Based on over two hundred participants, the survey results\
    \ confirm earlier observations, that successful reproducibility requires more\
    \ than having access to code and data. Additionally, the results show that the\
    \ topic has to be tackled from the authors\u2019, reviewers\u2019 and community\u2019\
    s side."

  abstract: 'Building representative linguistic resources and NLP tools for non-standardized
    languages is challenging: when spelling is not determined by a norm, multiple
    written forms can be encountered for a given word, inducing a large proportion
    of out-of-vocabulary words. To embrace this diversity, we propose a methodology
    based on crowdsourced alternative spellings we use to extract rules applied to
    match OOV words with one of their spelling variants. This virtuous process enables
    the unsupervised augmentation of multi-variant lexicons without expert rule definition.
    We apply this multilingual methodology on Alsatian, a French regional language
    and provide an intrinsic evaluation of the correctness of the variants pairs,
    and an extrinsic evaluation on a downstream task. We show that in a low-resource
    scenario, 145 inital pairs can lead to the generation of 876 additional variant
    pairs, and a diminution of OOV words improving the part-of-speech tagging performance
    by 1 to 4%.'

  abstract: This paper describes a new approach for the task of contextual emotion
    detection. The approach is based on a neural feature extractor, composed of a
    recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism, followed by a classifier,
    that can be neural or SVM-based. We evaluated the model with the dataset of the
    task 3 of SemEval 2019 (EmoContext), which includes short 3-turn conversations,
    tagged with 4 emotion classes. The best performing setup was achieved using ELMo
    word embeddings and POS tags as input, bidirectional GRU as hidden units, and
    an SVM as the final classifier. This configuration reached 69.93% in terms of
    micro-average F1 score on the main 3 emotion classes, a score that outperformed
    the baseline system by 11.25%.

  abstract: 'Word meaning change can be inferred from drifts of time-varying word
    embeddings. However, temporal data may be too sparse to build robust word embeddings
    and to discriminate significant drifts from noise. In this paper, we compare three
    models to learn diachronic word embeddings on scarce data: incremental updating
    of a Skip-Gram from Kim et al. (2014), dynamic filtering from Bamler & Mandt (2017),
    and dynamic Bernoulli embeddings from Rudolph & Blei (2018). In particular, we
    study the performance of different initialisation schemes and emphasise what characteristics
    of each model are more suitable to data scarcity, relying on the distribution
    of detected drifts. Finally, we regularise the loss of these models to better
    adapt to scarce data.'

  abstract: This paper proposes a partially deterministic morphological analysis method
    for improved processing speed. Maximum matching is a fast deterministic method
    for morphological analysis. However, the method tends to decrease performance
    due to lack of consideration of contextual information. In order to use maximum
    matching safely, we propose the use of Context Independent Strings (CISs), which
    are strings that do not have ambiguity in terms of morphological analysis. Our
    method first identifies CISs in a sentence using maximum matching without contextual
    information, then analyzes the unprocessed part of the sentence using a bi-gram-based
    morphological analysis model. We evaluate the method on a Japanese morphological
    analysis task. The experimental results show a 30% reduction of running time while
    maintaining improved accuracy.

  abstract: 'Languages may be differently distant from each other and their mutual
    intelligibility may be asymmetric. In this paper we introduce incom.py, a toolbox
    for calculating linguistic distances and asymmetries between related languages.
    incom.py allows linguist experts to quickly and easily perform statistical analyses
    and compare those with experimental results. We demonstrate the efficacy of incom.py
    in an incomprehension experiment on two Slavic languages: Bulgarian and Russian.
    Using incom.py we were able to validate three methods to measure linguistic distances
    and asymmetries: Levenshtein distance, word adaptation surprisal, and conditional
    entropy as predictors of success in a reading intercomprehension experiment.'

  abstract: With the ever-growing generation of data for the Semantic Web comes an
    increasing demand for this data to be made available to non-semantic Web experts.
    One way of achieving this goal is to translate the languages of the Semantic Web
    into natural language. We present LD2NL, a framework that allows verbalizing the
    three key languages of the Semantic Web, i.e., RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. Our framework
    is based on a bottom-up approach to verbalization. We evaluated LD2NL in an open
    survey with 86 persons. Our results suggest that our framework can generate verbalizations
    that are close to natural languages and that can be easily understood by non-experts.
    Therewith, it enables non-domain experts to interpret Semantic Web data with more
    than 91% of the accuracy of domain experts.

  abstract: Information on drug administration is obtained traditionally from doctors
    and pharmacists, as well as leaflets which provide in most cases cumbersome and
    hard-to-follow details. Thus, the need for medical knowledge bases emerges to
    provide access to concrete and well-structured information which can play an important
    role in informing patients. This paper introduces a Romanian medical knowledge
    base focused on drug-drug interactions, on representing relevant drug information,
    and on symptom-disease relations. The knowledge base was created by extracting
    and transforming information using Natural Language Processing techniques from
    both structured and unstructured sources, together with manual annotations. The
    resulting Romanian ontologies are aligned with larger English medical ontologies.
    Our knowledge base supports queries regarding drugs (e.g., active ingredients,
    concentration, expiration date), drug-drug interaction, symptom-disease relations,
    as well as drug-symptom relations.

  abstract: We propose a simple method for post-processing the outputs of a text summarization
    system in order to refine its overall quality. Our approach is to train text-to-text
    rewriting models to correct information redundancy errors that may arise during
    summarization. We train on synthetically generated noisy summaries, testing three
    different types of noise that introduce out-of-context information within each
    summary. When applied on top of extractive and abstractive summarization baselines,
    our summary denoising models yield metric improvements while reducing redundancy.

  abstract: We propose a simple unsupervised method for extracting pseudo-parallel
    monolingual sentence pairs from comparable corpora representative of two different
    text styles, such as news articles and scientific papers. Our approach does not
    require a seed parallel corpus, but instead relies solely on hierarchical search
    over pre-trained embeddings of documents and sentences. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    of our method through automatic and extrinsic evaluation on text simplification
    from the normal to the Simple Wikipedia. We show that pseudo-parallel sentences
    extracted with our method not only supplement existing parallel data, but can
    even lead to competitive performance on their own.

  abstract: 'Images and text represent types of content which are used together for
    conveying user emotions in online social networks. These contents are usually
    associated with a sentiment category. In this paper, we investigate an approach
    for mapping images to text for three types of sentiment categories: positive,
    neutral and negative. The mapping from images to text is performed using a Kernel
    Ridge Regression model. We considered two types of image features: i) RGB pixel-values
    features, and ii) features extracted with a deep learning approach. The experimental
    evaluation was performed on a Twitter data set containing both text and images
    and the sentiment associated with these. The experimental results show a difference
    in performance for different sentiment categories, in particular the mapping that
    we propose performs better for the positive sentiment category in comparison with
    the neutral and negative ones. Furthermore, the experimental results show that
    the more complex deep learning features perform better than the RGB pixel-value
    features for all sentiment categories and for larger training sets.'

  abstract: This study is an attempt to contribute to documentation and revitalization
    efforts of endangered Laz language, a member of South Caucasian language family
    mainly spoken on northeastern coastline of Turkey. It constitutes the first steps
    to create a general computational model for word form recognition and production
    for Laz by building a rule-based morphological analyser using Helsinki Finite-State
    Toolkit (HFST). The evaluation results show that the analyser has a 64.9% coverage
    over a corpus collected for this study with 111,365 tokens. We have also performed
    an error analysis on randomly selected 100 tokens from the corpus which are not
    covered by the analyser, and these results show that the errors mostly result
    from Turkish words in the corpus and missing stems in our lexicon.

  abstract: Very short texts, such as tweets and invoices, present challenges in classification.
    Although term occurrences are strong indicators of content, in very short texts,
    the sparsity of these texts makes it difficult to capture important semantic relationships.
    A solution calls for a method that not only considers term occurrence, but also
    handles sparseness well. In this work, we introduce such an approach, the Term
    Based Semantic Clusters (TBSeC) that employs terms to create distinctive semantic
    concept clusters. These clusters are ranked using a semantic similarity function
    which in turn defines a semantic feature space that can be used for text classification.
    Our method is evaluated in an invoice classification task. Compared to well-known
    content representation methods the proposed method performs competitively.

  abstract: The detection of quotations (i.e., reported speech, thought, and writing)
    has established itself as an NLP analysis task. However, state-of-the-art models
    have been developed on the basis of specific corpora and incorpo- rate a high
    degree of corpus-specific assumptions and knowledge, which leads to fragmentation.
    In the spirit of task-agnostic modeling, we present a corpus-agnostic neural model
    for quotation detection and evaluate it on three corpora that vary in language,
    text genre, and structural assumptions. The model (a) approaches the state-of-the-art
    on the corpora when using established feature sets and (b) shows reasonable performance
    even when us- ing solely word forms, which makes it applicable for non-standard
    (i.e., historical) corpora.

  abstract: "In today\u2019s digital world of information, a fact verification system\
    \ to disprove assertions made in speech, print media or online content is the\
    \ need of the hour. We propose a system which would verify a claim against a source\
    \ and classify the claim to be true, false, out-of-context or an inappropriate\
    \ claim with respect to the textual source provided to the system. A true label\
    \ is used if the claim is true, false if it is false, if the claim has no relation\
    \ with the source then it is classified as out-of-context and if the claim cannot\
    \ be verified at all then it is classified as inappropriate. This would help us\
    \ to verify a claim or a fact as well as know about the source or our knowledge\
    \ base against which we are trying to verify our facts. We used a two-step approach\
    \ to achieve our goal. At first, we retrieved evidence related to the claims from\
    \ the textual source using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)\
    \ vectors. Later we classified the claim-evidence pairs as true, false, inappropriate\
    \ and out of context using a modified version of textual entailment module. Textual\
    \ entailment module calculates the probability of each sentence supporting the\
    \ claim, contradicting the claim or not providing any relevant information using\
    \ Bi-LSTM network to assess the veracity of the claim. The accuracy of the best\
    \ performing system is 64.49%"

  abstract: This paper presents Semantic Neural Networks (SNNs), a knowledge-aware
    component based on deep learning. SNNs can be trained to encode explicit semantic
    knowledge from an arbitrary knowledge base, and can subsequently be combined with
    other deep learning architectures. At prediction time, SNNs provide a semantic
    encoding extracted from the input data, which can be exploited by other neural
    network components to build extended representation models that can face alternative
    problems. The SNN architecture is defined in terms of the concepts and relations
    present in a knowledge base. Based on this architecture, a training procedure
    is developed. Finally, an experimental setup is presented to illustrate the behaviour
    and performance of a SNN for a specific NLP problem, in this case, opinion mining
    for the classification of movie reviews.

  abstract: This paper compares how different machine learning classifiers can be
    used together with simple string matching and named entity recognition to detect
    locations in texts. We compare five different state-of-the-art machine learning
    classifiers in order to predict whether a sentence contains a location or not.
    Following this classification task, we use a string matching algorithm with a
    gazetteer to identify the exact index of a toponym within the sentence. We evaluate
    different approaches in terms of machine learning classifiers, text pre-processing
    and location extraction on the SemEval-2019 Task 12 dataset, compiled for toponym
    resolution in the bio-medical domain. Finally, we compare the results with our
    system that was previously submitted to the SemEval-2019 task evaluation.

  abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models achieve their best performance
    when large sets of parallel data are used for training. Consequently, techniques
    for augmenting the training set have become popular recently. One of these methods
    is back-translation, which consists on generating synthetic sentences by translating
    a set of monolingual, target-language sentences using a Machine Translation (MT)
    model. Generally, NMT models are used for back-translation. In this work, we analyze
    the performance of models when the training data is extended with synthetic data
    using different MT approaches. In particular we investigate back-translated data
    generated not only by NMT but also by Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models
    and combinations of both. The results reveal that the models achieve the best
    performances when the training set is augmented with back-translated data created
    by merging different MT approaches.

  abstract: One of the challenges during a task-oriented chatbot development is the
    scarce availability of the labeled training data. The best way of getting one
    is to ask the assessors to tag each dialogue according to its intent. Unfortunately,
    performing labeling without any provisional collection structure is difficult
    since the very notion of the intent is ill-defined. In this paper, we propose
    a hierarchical multimodal regularized topic model to obtain a first approximation
    of the intent set. Our rationale for hierarchical models usage is their ability
    to take into account several degrees of the dialogues relevancy. We attempt to
    build a model that can distinguish between subject-based (e.g. medicine and transport
    topics) and action-based (e.g. filing of an application and tracking application
    status) similarities. In order to achieve this, we divide set of all features
    into several groups according to part-of-speech analysis. Various feature groups
    are treated differently on different hierarchy levels.

    information from these lexical resources can lead to gains in a downstream task,
    namely frame identification. While much of the current work in frame identification
    uses various neural architectures to predict frames, those neural architectures
    only use representations of frames based on annotated corpus data. We demonstrate
    how incorporating knowledge directly from the FrameNet graph structure improves
    the performance of a neural network-based frame identification system. Specifically,
    we construct a bidirectional LSTM with a loss function that incorporates various
    graph- and corpus-based frame embeddings for learning and ultimately achieves
    strong performance gains with the graph-based embeddings over corpus-based embeddings
    alone.

  abstract: 'This paper introduces several improvements over the current state of
    the art in knowledge-based word sense disambiguation. Those innovations are the
    result of modifying and enriching a knowledge base created originally on the basis
    of WordNet. They reflect several separate but connected strategies: manipulating
    the shape and the content of the knowledge base, assigning weights over the relations
    in the knowledge base, and the addition of new relations to it. The main contribution
    of the paper is to demonstrate that the previously proposed knowledge bases organize
    linguistic and world knowledge suboptimally for the task of word sense disambiguation.
    In doing so, the paper also establishes a new state of the art for knowledge-based
    approaches. Its best models are competitive in the broader context of supervised
    systems as well.'

  abstract: "The translation of ambiguous words still poses challenges for machine\
    \ translation. In this work, we carry out a systematic quantitative analysis regarding\
    \ the ability of different machine translation systems to disambiguate the source\
    \ language conjunctions \u201Cbut\u201D and \u201Cand\u201D. We evaluate specialised\
    \ test sets focused on the translation of these two conjunctions. The test sets\
    \ contain source languages that do not distinguish different variants of the given\
    \ conjunction, whereas the target languages do. In total, we evaluate the conjunction\
    \ \u201Cbut\u201D on 20 translation outputs, and the conjunction \u201Cand\u201D\
    \ on 10. All machine translation systems almost perfectly recognise one variant\
    \ of the target conjunction, especially for the source conjunction \u201Cbut\u201D\
    . The other target variant, however, represents a challenge for machine translation\
    \ systems, with accuracy varying from 50% to 95% for \u201Cbut\u201D and from\
    \ 20% to 57% for \u201Cand\u201D. The major error for all systems is replacing\
    \ the correct target variant with the opposite one."

  abstract: We present a live cross-lingual system capable of producing shallow semantic
    annotations of natural language sentences for 51 languages at this time. The domain
    of the input sentences is in principle unconstrained. The system uses single training
    data (in English) for all the languages. The resulting semantic annotations are
    therefore consistent across different languages. We use CoNLL Semantic Role Labeling
    training data and Universal dependencies as the basis for the system. The system
    is publicly available and supports processing data in batches; therefore, it can
    be easily used by the community for the following research tasks.

  abstract: Fake news detection and closely-related fact-checking have recently attracted
    a lot of attention. Automatization of these tasks has been already studied for
    English. For other languages, only a few studies can be found (e.g. (Baly et al.,
    2018)), and to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted for West
    Slavic languages. In this paper, we present datasets for Czech, Polish, and Slovak.
    We also ran initial experiments which set a baseline for further research into
    this area.

  abstract: 'Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks depend on using Named Entities
    (NEs) that are contained in texts and in external knowledge sources. While this
    is easy for humans, the present neural methods that rely on learned word embeddings
    may not perform well for these NLP tasks, especially in the presence of Out-Of-Vocabulary
    (OOV) or rare NEs. In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem, and
    present empirical evaluations on: a) a structured Question-Answering task, b)
    three related Goal-Oriented dialog tasks, and c) a Reading-Comprehension task,
    which show that the proposed method can be effective in dealing with both in-vocabulary
    and OOV NEs. We create extended versions of dialog bAbI tasks 1,2 and 4 and OOV

  abstract: Calculating Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) plays a significant role
    in many applications such as question answering, document summarisation, information
    retrieval and information extraction. All modern state of the art STS methods
    rely on word embeddings one way or another. The recently introduced contextualised
    word embeddings have proved more effective than standard word embeddings in many
    natural language processing tasks. This paper evaluates the impact of several
    contextualised word embeddings on unsupervised STS methods and compares it with
    the existing supervised/unsupervised STS methods for different datasets in different
    languages and different domains

  abstract: Traditional approaches to automatic term extraction do not rely on machine
    learning (ML) and select the top n ranked candidate terms or candidate terms above
    a certain predefined cut-off point, based on a limited number of linguistic and
    statistical clues. However, supervised ML approaches are gaining interest. Relatively
    little is known about the impact of these supervised methodologies; evaluations
    are often limited to precision, and sometimes recall and f1-scores, without information
    about the nature of the extracted candidate terms. Therefore, the current paper
    presents a detailed and elaborate analysis and comparison of a traditional, state-of-the-art
    system (TermoStat) and a new, supervised ML approach (HAMLET), using the results
    obtained for the same, manually annotated, Dutch corpus about dressage.

  abstract: News articles often convey attitudes between the mentioned subjects, which
    is essential for understanding the described situation. In this paper, we describe
    a new approach to distant supervision for extracting sentiment attitudes between
    named entities mentioned in texts. Two factors (pair-based and frame-based) were
    used to automatically label an extensive news collection, dubbed as RuAttitudes.
    The latter became a basis for adaptation and training convolutional architectures,
    including piecewise max pooling and full use of information across different sentences.
    The results show that models, trained with RuAttitudes, outperform ones that were
    trained with only supervised learning approach and achieve 13.4% increase in F1-score
    on RuSentRel collection.

  abstract: Self-attentional models are a new paradigm for sequence modelling tasks
    which differ from common sequence modelling methods, such as recurrence-based
    and convolution-based sequence learning, in the way that their architecture is
    only based on the attention mechanism. Self-attentional models have been used
    in the creation of the state-of-the-art models in many NLP task such as neural
    machine translation, but their usage has not been explored for the task of training
    end-to-end task-oriented dialogue generation systems yet. In this study, we apply
    these models on the DSTC2 dataset for training task-oriented chatbots. Our finding
    shows that self-attentional models can be exploited to create end-to-end task-oriented
    chatbots which not only achieve higher evaluation scores compared to recurrence-based
    models, but also do so more efficiently.

  abstract: Vectorial representations of meaning can be supported by empirical data
    from diverse sources and obtained with diverse embedding approaches. This paper
    aims at screening this experimental space and reports on an assessment of word
    embeddings supported (i) by data in raw texts vs. in lexical graphs, (ii) by lexical
    information encoded in association- vs. inference-based graphs, and obtained (iii)
    by edge reconstruction- vs. matrix factorisation vs. random walk-based graph embedding
    methods. The results observed with these experiments indicate that the best solutions
    with graph-based word embeddings are very competitive, consistently outperforming
    mainstream text-based ones.

  abstract: Recurrent Neural Network Language Models composed of LSTM units, especially
    those augmented with an external memory, have achieved state-of-the-art results
    in Language Modeling. However, these models still struggle to process long sequences
    which are more likely to contain long-distance dependencies because of information
    fading. In this paper we demonstrate an effective mechanism for retrieving information
    in a memory augmented LSTM LM based on attending to information in memory in proportion
    to the number of timesteps the LSTM gating mechanism persisted the information.

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a rule- and lexicon-based system for the recognition
    of Named Entities (NE) in Serbian newspaper texts that was used to prepare a gold
    standard annotated with personal names. It was further used to prepare training
    sets for four different levels of annotation, which were further used to train
    two Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems: Stanford and spaCy. All obtained models,
    together with a rule- and lexicon-based system were evaluated on two sample texts:
    a part of the gold standard and an independent newspaper text of approximately
    the same size. The results show that rule- and lexicon-based system outperforms
    trained models in all four scenarios (measured by F1), while Stanford models has
    the highest precision. All systems obtain best results in recognizing full names,
    while the recognition of first names only is rather poor. The produced models
    are incorporated into a Web platform NER&Beyond that provides various NE-related
    functions.'

  abstract: "The research presented here is based on the theoretical model of corpus\
    \ lattices. We implemented this as an effective data structure, and developed\
    \ an algorithm based on this structure to discover essential verbal expressions\
    \ from corpus data. The idea behind the algorithm is the \u201Cjump and stay\u201D\
    \ principle, which tells us that our target expressions will be found at such\
    \ places in the lattice where the value of a suitable function (defined on the\
    \ vertex set of the corpus lattice) significantly increases (jumps) and then remains\
    \ the same (stays). We evaluated our method on Hungarian data. Evaluation shows\
    \ that about 75% of the obtained expressions are correct, actual errors are rare.\
    \ Thus, this paper is 1. a proof of concept concerning the corpus lattice model,\
    \ opening the way to investigate this structure further through our implementation;\
    \ and 2. a proof of concept of the \u201Cjump and stay\u201D idea and the algorithm\
    \ itself, opening the way to apply it further, e.g. for other languages."

  abstract: In recent years an increasing number of analyses of offensive language
    has been published, however, dealing mainly with the automatic detection and classification
    of isolated instances. In this paper we aim to understand the impact of offensive
    messages in online conversations diachronically, and in particular the change
    in offensiveness of dialogue turns. In turn, we aim to measure the progression
    of offence level as well as its direction - For example, whether a conversation
    is escalating or declining in offence. We present our method of extracting linear
    dialogues from tree-structured conversations in social media data and make our
    code publicly available. Furthermore, we discuss methods to analyse this dataset
    through changes in discourse offensiveness. Our paper includes two main contributions;
    first, using a neural network to measure the level of offensiveness in conversations;
    and second, the analysis of conversations around offensive comments using decoupling
    functions.

  abstract: Despite being a fairly recent phenomenon, emojis have quickly become ubiquitous.
    Besides their extensive use in social media, they are now also invoked in customer
    surveys and feedback forms. Hence, there is a need for techniques to understand
    their sentiment and emotion. In this work, we provide a method to quantify the
    emotional association of basic emotions such as anger, fear, joy, and sadness
    for a set of emojis. We collect and process a unique corpus of 20 million emoji-centric
    tweets, such that we can capture rich emoji semantics using a comparably small
    dataset. We evaluate the induced emotion profiles of emojis with regard to their
    ability to predict word affect intensities as well as sentiment scores.

  abstract: We propose a morphologically informed model for named entity recognition,
    which is based on LSTM-CRF architecture and combines word embeddings, Bi-LSTM
    character embeddings, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and morphological information.
    While previous work has focused on learning from raw word input, using word and
    character embeddings only, we show that for morphologically rich languages, such
    as Bulgarian, access to POS information contributes more to the performance gains
    than the detailed morphological information. Thus, we show that named entity recognition
    needs only coarse-grained POS tags, but at the same time it can benefit from simultaneously
    using some POS information of different granularity. Our evaluation results over
    a standard dataset show sizeable improvements over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian
    NER.

  abstract: 'We address the problem of cognate identification across vocabulary pairs
    of any set of languages. In particular, we focus on the case where the examined
    pair of languages are low-resource to the extent that no training data whatsoever
    in these languages, or even closely related ones, are available for the task.
    We investigate the extent to which training data from another, unrelated language
    family can be used instead. Our approach consists of learning a similarity metric
    from example cognates in Indo-European languages and applying it to low-resource
    Sami languages of the Uralic family. We apply two models following previous work:
    a Siamese convolutional neural network (S-CNN) and a support vector machine (SVM),
    and compare them with a Levenshtein-distance baseline. We test performance on
    three Sami languages and find that the S-CNN outperforms the other approaches,
    suggesting that it is better able to learn such general characteristics of cognateness
    that carry over across language families. We also experiment with fine-tuning
    the S-CNN model with data from within the language family in order to quantify
    how well this model can make use of a small amount of target-domain data to adapt.'

  abstract: Parallel corpora are crucial resources for NLP applications, most notably
    for machine translation. The direction of the (human) translation of parallel
    corpora has been shown to have significant implications for the quality of statistical
    machine translation systems that are trained with such corpora. We describe a
    method for determining the direction of the (manual) translation of parallel corpora
    at the sentence-pair level. Using several linguistically-motivated features, coupled
    with a neural network model, we obtain high accuracy on several language pairs.
    Furthermore, we demonstrate that the accuracy is correlated with the (typological)
    distance between the two languages.

    MT systems, the phrase-based MT (PBMT) and the neural MT (NMT). We explore three
    different scenarios for using the ATS in MT: (1) using the raw output of the ATS;
    (2) automatically filtering out the sentences with low grammaticality and meaning
    preservation scores; and (3) performing a minimal manual correction of the ATS
    output. Our results show improvement in fluency of the translation regardless
    of the chosen scenario, and difference in success of the three scenarios depending
    on the MT approach used (PBMT or NMT) with regards to improving translation fluency
    and post-editing effort.'

  abstract: Abusive language detection has received much attention in the last years,
    and recent approaches perform the task in a number of different languages. We
    investigate which factors have an effect on multilingual settings, focusing on
    the compatibility of data and annotations. In the current paper, we focus on English
    and German. Our findings show large differences in performance between the two
    languages. We find that the best performance is achieved by different classification
    algorithms. Sampling to address class imbalance issues is detrimental for German
    and beneficial for English. The only similarity that we find is that neither data
    set shows clear topics when we compare the results of topic modeling to the gold
    standard. Based on our findings, we can conclude that a multilingual optimization
    of classifiers is not possible even in settings where comparable data sets are
    used.

  abstract: Previous work on using BiLSTM models for PoS tagging has primarily focused
    on small tagsets. We evaluate BiLSTM models for tagging Icelandic, a morphologically
    rich language, using a relatively large tagset. Our baseline BiLSTM model achieves
    higher accuracy than any other previously published tagger, when not taking advantage
    of a morphological lexicon. When we extend the model by incorporating such data,
    we outperform the earlier state-of-the-art results by a significant margin. We
    also report on work in progress that attempts to address the problem of data sparsity
    inherent to morphologically detailed, fine-grained tagsets. We experiment with
    training a separate model on only the lexical category and using the coarse-grained
    output tag as an input into to the main model. This method further increases the
    accuracy and reduces the tagging errors by 21.3% compared to previous state-of-the-art
    results. Finally, we train and test our tagger on a new gold standard for Icelandic.

  abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
    based on Quantum Probability Theory. The Quantum WSD algorithm requires concepts
    representations as vectors in the complex domain and thus we have developed a
    technique for computing complex word and sentence embeddings based on the Paragraph
    Vectors algorithm. Despite the proposed method is quite simple and that it does
    not require long training phases, when it is evaluated on a standardized benchmark
    for this task it exhibits state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances.

  abstract: In this paper, we try to understand neural machine translation (NMT) via
    simplifying NMT architectures and training encoder-free NMT models. In an encoder-free
    model, the sums of word embeddings and positional embeddings represent the source.
    The decoder is a standard Transformer or recurrent neural network that directly
    attends to embeddings via attention mechanisms. Experimental results show (1)
    that the attention mechanism in encoder-free models acts as a strong feature extractor,
    (2) that the word embeddings in encoder-free models are competitive to those in
    conventional models, (3) that non-contextualized source representations lead to
    a big performance drop, and (4) that encoder-free models have different effects
    on alignment quality for German-English and Chinese-English.

  abstract: "Collaboratively constructed knowledge bases play an important role in\
    \ information systems, but are essentially always incomplete. Thus, a large number\
    \ of models has been developed for Knowledge Base Completion, the task of predicting\
    \ new attributes of entities given partial descriptions of these entities. Virtually\
    \ all of these models either concentrate on numeric attributes (<Italy,GDP,2T$>)\
    \ or they concentrate on categorical attributes (<Tim Cook,chairman,Apple>). In\
    \ this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward neural architecture to jointly\
    \ predict numeric and categorical attributes based on embeddings learned from\
    \ textual occurrences of the entities in question. Following insights from multi-task\
    \ learning, our hypothesis is that due to the correlations among attributes of\
    \ different kinds, joint prediction improves over separate prediction. Our experiments\
    \ on seven FreeBase domains show that this hypothesis is true of the two attribute\
    \ types: we find substantial improvements for numeric attributes in the joint\
    \ model, while performance remains largely unchanged for categorical attributes.\
    \ Our analysis indicates that this is the case because categorical attributes,\
    \ many of which describe membership in various classes, provide useful \u2018\
    background knowledge\u2019 for numeric prediction, while this is true to a lesser\
    \ degree in the inverse direction."

  abstract: Arabizi is an informal written form of dialectal Arabic transcribed in
    Latin alphanumeric characters. It has a proven popularity on chat platforms and
    social media, yet it suffers from a severe lack of natural language processing
    (NLP) resources. As such, texts written in Arabizi are often disregarded in sentiment
    analysis tasks for Arabic. In this paper we describe the creation of a sentiment
    lexicon for Arabizi that was enriched with word embeddings. The result is a new
    Arabizi lexicon consisting of 11.3K positive and 13.3K negative words. We evaluated
    this lexicon by classifying the sentiment of Arabizi tweets achieving an F1-score
    of 0.72. We provide a detailed error analysis to present the challenges that impact
    the sentiment analysis of Arabizi.

  abstract: Semantic change detection (i.e., identifying words whose meaning has changed
    over time) started emerging as a growing area of research over the past decade,
    with important downstream applications in natural language processing, historical
    linguistics and computational social science. However, several obstacles make
    progress in the domain slow and difficult. These pertain primarily to the lack
    of well-established gold standard datasets, resources to study the problem at
    a fine-grained temporal resolution, and quantitative evaluation approaches. In
    this work, we aim to mitigate these issues by (a) releasing a new labelled dataset
    of more than 47K word vectors trained on the UK Web Archive over a short time-frame
    (2000-2013); (b) proposing a variant of Procrustes alignment to detect words that
    have undergone semantic shift; and (c) introducing a rank-based approach for evaluation
    purposes. Through extensive numerical experiments and validation, we illustrate
    the effectiveness of our approach against competitive baselines. Finally, we also
    make our resources publicly available to further enable research in the domain.

  abstract: Cross-lingual word embedding models learn a shared vector space for two
    or more languages so that words with similar meaning are represented by similar
    vectors regardless of their language. Although the existing models achieve high
    performance on pairs of morphologically simple languages, they perform very poorly
    on morphologically rich languages such as Turkish and Finnish. In this paper,
    we propose a morpheme-based model in order to increase the performance of cross-lingual
    word embeddings on morphologically rich languages. Our model includes a simple
    extension which enables us to exploit morphemes for cross-lingual mapping. We
    applied our model for the Turkish-Finnish language pair on the bilingual word
    translation task. Results show that our model outperforms the baseline models
    by 2% in the nearest neighbour ranking.

  abstract: We propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for estimating the check-worthiness
    of claims in political debates. Given a political debate, such as the 2016 US
    Presidential and Vice-Presidential ones, the task is to predict which statements
    in the debate should be prioritized for fact-checking. While different fact-checking
    organizations would naturally make different choices when analyzing the same debate,
    we show that it pays to learn from multiple sources simultaneously (PolitiFact,
    FactCheck, ABC, CNN, NPR, NYT, Chicago Tribune, The Guardian, and Washington Post)
    in a multi-task learning setup, even when a particular source is chosen as a target
    to imitate. Our evaluation shows state-of-the-art results on a standard dataset
    for the task of check-worthiness prediction.

  abstract: This paper presents an approach for prediction of results for sport events.
    Usually the sport forecasting approaches are based on structured data. We test
    the hypothesis that the sports results can be predicted by using natural language
    processing and machine learning techniques applied over interviews with the players
    shortly before the sport events. The proposed method uses deep learning contextual
    models, applied over unstructured textual documents. Several experiments were
    performed for interviews with players in individual sports like boxing, martial
    arts, and tennis. The results from the conducted experiment confirmed our initial
    assumption that an interview from a sportsman before a match contains information
    that can be used for prediction the outcome from it. Furthermore, the results
    provide strong evidence in support of our research hypothesis, that is, we can
    predict the outcome from a sport match analyzing an interview, given before it.

  abstract: We describe a novel system for automatic extraction of typological linguistic
    information from descriptive grammars of natural languages, applying the theory
    of frame semantics in the form of frame-semantic parsing. The current proof-of-concept
    system covers a few selected linguistic features, but the methodology is general
    and can be extended not only to other typological features but also to descriptive
    grammars written in languages other than English. Such a system is expected to
    be a useful assistance for automatic curation of typological databases which otherwise
    are built manually, a very labor and time consuming as well as cognitively taxing
    enterprise.

  abstract: "Natural language inference (NLI) is a key part of natural language understanding.\
    \ The NLI task is defined as a decision problem whether a given sentence \u2013\
    \ hypothesis \u2013 can be inferred from a given text. Typically, we deal with\
    \ a text consisting of just a single premise/single sentence, which is called\
    \ a single premise entailment (SPE) task. Recently, a derived task of NLI from\
    \ multiple premises (MPE) was introduced together with the first annotated corpus\
    \ and corresponding several strong baselines. Nevertheless, the further development\
    \ in MPE field requires accessibility of huge amounts of annotated data. In this\
    \ paper we introduce a novel method for rapid deriving of MPE corpora from an\
    \ existing NLI (SPE) annotated data that does not require any additional annotation\
    \ work. This proposed approach is based on using an open information extraction\
    \ system. We demonstrate the application of the method on a well known SNLI corpus.\
    \ Over the obtained corpus, we provide the first evaluations as well as we state\
    \ a strong baseline."

  abstract: In this paper we describe how an abstractive text summarization method
    improved the informativeness of automatic summaries by integrating syntactic text
    simplification, subject-verb-object concept frequency scoring and a set of rules
    that transform text into its semantic representation. We analyzed the impact of
    each component of our approach on the quality of generated summaries and tested
    it on DUC 2002 dataset. Our experiments showed that our approach outperformed
    other state-of-the-art abstractive methods while maintaining acceptable linguistic
    quality and redundancy rate.

  abstract: 'Given many recent advanced embedding models, selecting pre-trained word
    representation (i.e., word embedding) models best fit for a specific downstream
    NLP task is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to extracting,
    evaluating, and visualizing multiple sets of pre-trained word embed- dings to
    determine which embeddings should be used in a downstream task. First, for extraction,
    we provide a method to extract a subset of the embeddings to be used in the downstream
    NLP tasks. Second, for evaluation, we analyse the quality of pre-trained embeddings
    using an input word analogy list. Finally, we visualize the embedding space to
    explore the embedded words interactively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
    the proposed approach on our pre-trained word embedding models in Vietnamese to
    select which models are suitable for a named entity recogni- tion (NER) task.
    Specifically, we create a large Vietnamese word analogy list to evaluate and select
    the pre-trained embedding models for the task. We then utilize the selected embed-
    dings for the NER task and achieve the new state-of-the-art results on the task
    benchmark dataset. We also apply the approach to another downstream task of privacy-guaranteed
    embedding selection, and show that it helps users quickly select the most suitable
    embeddings. In addition, we create an open-source system using the proposed systematic
    approach to facilitate similar studies on other NLP tasks. The source code and
    data are available at https: //github.com/vietnlp/etnlp.'

  abstract: In this paper we present a morpho-syntactic tagger dedicated to Computer-mediated
    Communication texts in Polish. Its construction is based on an expanded RNN-based
    neural network adapted to the work on noisy texts. Among several techniques, the
    tagger utilises fastText embedding vectors, sequential character embedding vectors,
    and Brown clustering for the coarse-grained representation of sentence structures.
    In addition a set of manually written rules was proposed for post-processing.
    The system was trained to disambiguate descriptions of words in relation to Parts
    of Speech tags together with the full morphological information in terms of values
    for the different grammatical categories. We present also evaluation of several
    model variants on the gold standard annotated CMC data, comparison to the state-of-the-art
    taggers for Polish and error analysis. The proposed tagger shows significantly
    better results in this domain and demonstrates the viability of adaptation.

  abstract: The current state of the art for First Story Detection (FSD) are nearest
    neighbour-based models with traditional term vector representations; however,
    one challenge faced by FSD models is that the document representation is usually
    defined by the vocabulary and term frequency from a background corpus. Consequently,
    the ideal background corpus should arguably be both large-scale to ensure adequate
    term coverage, and similar to the target domain in terms of the language distribution.
    However, given these two factors cannot always be mutually satisfied, in this
    paper we examine whether the distributional similarity of common terms is more
    important than the scale of common terms for FSD. As a basis for our analysis
    we propose a set of metrics to quantitatively measure the scale of common terms
    and the distributional similarity between corpora. Using these metrics we rank
    different background corpora relative to a target corpus. We also apply models
    based on different background corpora to the FSD task. Our results show that term
    distributional similarity is more predictive of good FSD performance than the
    scale of common terms; and, thus we demonstrate that a smaller recent domain-related
    corpus will be more suitable than a very large-scale general corpus for FSD.

  abstract: The goal of this paper is to use all available Polish language data sets
    to seek the best possible performance in supervised sentiment analysis of short
    texts. We use text collections with labelled sentiment such as tweets, movie reviews
    and a sentiment treebank, in three comparison modes. In the first, we examine
    the performance of models trained and tested on the same text collection using
    standard cross-validation (in-domain). In the second we train models on all available
    data except the given test collection, which we use for testing (one vs rest cross-domain).
    In the third, we train a model on one data set and apply it to another one (one
    vs one cross-domain). We compare wide range of methods including machine learning
    on bag-of-words representation, bidirectional recurrent neural networks as well
    as the most recent pre-trained architectures ELMO and BERT. We formulate conclusions
    as to cross-domain and in-domain performance of each method. Unsurprisingly, BERT
    turned out to be a strong performer, especially in the cross-domain setting. What
    is surprising however, is solid performance of the relatively simple multinomial
    Naive Bayes classifier, which performed equally well as BERT on several data sets.

  abstract: 'Gold standard corpora and competitive evaluations play a key role in
    benchmarking named entity linking (NEL) performance and driving the development
    of more sophisticated NEL systems. The quality of the used corpora and the used
    evaluation metrics are crucial in this process. We, therefore, assess the quality
    of three popular evaluation corpora, identifying four major issues which affect
    these gold standards: (i) the use of different annotation styles, (ii) incorrect
    and missing annotations, (iii) Knowledge Base evolution, (iv) and differences
    in annotating co-occurrences. This paper addresses these issues by formalizing
    NEL annotations and corpus versioning which allows standardizing corpus creation,
    supports corpus evolution, and paves the way for the use of lenses to automatically
    transform between different corpus configurations. In addition, the use of clearly
    defined scoring rules and evaluation metrics ensures a better comparability of
    evaluation results.'

  abstract: We propose a method for non-projective dependency parsing by incrementally
    predicting a set of edges. Since the edges do not have a pre-specified order,
    we propose a set-based learning method. Our method blends graph, transition, and
    easy-first parsing, including a prior state of the parser as a special case. The
    proposed transition-based method successfully parses near the state of the art
    on both projective and non-projective languages, without assuming a certain parsing
    order.

  abstract: "The processing of medical information is not a trivial task for medical\
    \ non-experts. The paper presents an artificial assistant designed to facilitate\
    \ a reliable access to medical online contents. Interactions are modelled as doctor-patient\
    \ Question Answering sessions within a pre-operative patient education scenario\
    \ where the system addresses patient\u2019s information needs explaining medical\
    \ events and procedures. This implies an accurate medical information extraction\
    \ from and reasoning with available medical knowledge and large amounts of unstructured\
    \ multilingual online data. Bridging the gap between medical knowledge and data,\
    \ we explore a language-agnostic approach to medical concepts mining from the\
    \ standard terminologies, and the data-driven collection of the corresponding\
    \ seed terms in a distant supervision setting for German. Experimenting with different\
    \ terminologies, features and term matching strategies, we achieved a promising\
    \ F-score of 0.91 on the medical term extraction task. The concepts and terms\
    \ are used to search and retrieve definitions from the verified online free resources.\
    \ The proof-of-concept definition retrieval system is designed and evaluated showing\
    \ promising results, acceptable by humans in 92% of cases."

  abstract: NLP approaches to automatic text adaptation often rely on user-need guidelines
    which are generic and do not account for the differences between various types
    of target groups. One such group are adults with high-functioning autism, who
    are usually able to read long sentences and comprehend difficult words but whose
    comprehension may be impeded by other linguistic constructions. This is especially
    challenging for real-world user-generated texts such as product reviews, which
    cannot be controlled editorially and are thus a particularly good applcation for
    automatic text adaptation systems. In this paper we present a mixed-methods survey
    conducted with 24 adult web-users diagnosed with autism and an age-matched control
    group of 33 neurotypical participants. The aim of the survey was to identify whether
    the group with autism experienced any barriers when reading online reviews, what
    these potential barriers were, and what NLP methods would be best suited to improve
    the accessibility of online reviews for people with autism. The group with autism
    consistently reported significantly greater difficulties with understanding online
    product reviews compared to the control group and identified issues related to
    text length, poor topic organisation, and the use of irony and sarcasm.

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present a two-level morphological analyzer for Turkish.
    The morphological analyzer consists of five main components: finite state transducer,
    rule engine for suffixation, lexicon, trie data structure, and LRU cache. We use
    Java language to implement finite state machine logic and rule engine, Xml language
    to describe the finite state transducer rules of the Turkish language, which makes
    the morphological analyzer both easily extendible and easily applicable to other
    languages. Empowered with the comprehensiveness of a lexicon of 54,000 bare-forms
    including 19,000 proper nouns, our morphological analyzer presents one of the
    most reliable analyzers produced so far. The analyzer is compared with Turkish
    morphological analyzers in the literature. By using LRU cache and a trie data
    structure, the system can analyze 100,000 words per second, which enables users
    to analyze huge corpora in a few hours.'

  abstract: Self-attention networks (SAN) have shown promising performance in various
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) scenarios, especially in machine translation.
    One of the main points of SANs is the strength of capturing long-range and multi-scale
    dependencies from the data. In this paper, we present a novel intent detection
    system which is based on a self-attention network and a Bi-LSTM. Our approach
    shows improvement by using a transformer model and deep averaging network-based
    universal sentence encoder compared to previous solutions. We evaluate the system
    on Snips, Smart Speaker, Smart Lights, and ATIS datasets by different evaluation
    metrics. The performance of the proposed model is compared with LSTM with the
    same datasets.

  abstract: Short-text classification is a challenging task, due to the sparsity and
    high dimensionality of the feature space. In this study, we aim to analyze and
    classify Turkish tweets based on their topics. Social media jargon and the agglutinative
    structure of the Turkish language makes this classification task even harder.
    As far as we know, this is the first study that uses a Transformer Encoder for
    short text classification in Turkish. The model is trained in a weakly supervised
    manner, where the training data set has been labeled automatically. Our results
    on the test set, which has been manually labeled, show that performing morphological
    analysis improves the classification performance of the traditional machine learning
    algorithms Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. Still, the
    proposed approach achieves an F-score of 89.3 % outperforming those algorithms
    by at least 5 points.

  abstract: Dynamic topic models (DTMs) capture the evolution of topics and trends
    in time series data.Current DTMs are applicable only to monolingual datasets.
    In this paper we present the multilingual dynamic topic model (ML-DTM), a novel
    topic model that combines DTM with an existing multilingual topic modeling method
    to capture cross-lingual topics that evolve across time. We present results of
    this model on a parallel German-English corpus of news articles and a comparable
    corpus of Finnish and Swedish news articles. We demonstrate the capability of
    ML-DTM to track significant events related to a topic and show that it finds distinct
    topics and performs as well as existing multilingual topic models in aligning
    cross-lingual topics.

  abstract: We present an open-source, wide-coverage context-free grammar (CFG) for
    Icelandic, and an accompanying parsing system. The grammar has over 5,600 nonterminals,
    4,600 terminals and 19,000 productions in fully expanded form, with feature agreement
    constraints for case, gender, number and person. The parsing system consists of
    an enhanced Earley-based parser and a mechanism to select best-scoring parse trees
    from shared packed parse forests. Our parsing system is able to parse about 90%
    of all sentences in articles published on the main Icelandic news websites. Preliminary
    evaluation with evalb shows an F-measure of 70.72% on parsed sentences. Our system
    demonstrates that parsing a morphologically rich language using a wide-coverage
    CFG can be practical.

  abstract: Kazakh language, like other agglutinative languages, has specific difficulties
    on both recognition of wrong words and generation the corrections for misspelt
    words. The main goal of this work is to develop a better algorithm for the normalization
    of Kazakh texts based on traditional and Machine Learning methods, as well as
    the new approach which is also considered in this paper. The procedure of election
    among methods of normalization has been conducted in a manner of comparative analysis.
    The results of the comparative analysis turned up successful and are shown in
    details.

  abstract: Social media platforms have become prime forums for reporting news, with
    users sharing what they saw, heard or read on social media. News from social media
    is potentially useful for various stakeholders including aid organizations, news
    agencies, and individuals. However, social media also contains a vast amount of
    non-news content. For users to be able to draw on benefits from news reported
    on social media it is necessary to reliably identify news content and differentiate
    it from non-news. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of classifying a social
    post as news or not. To this end, we provide a new manually annotated dataset
    containing 2,992 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Unlike earlier datasets,
    it includes postings posted by personal users who do not promote a business or
    a product and are not affiliated with any organization. We also investigate various
    baseline systems and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset.
    Our results show that the best classifiers are the SVM and BERT models.

  abstract: African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a widely-spoken dialect
    of English, yet it is under-represented in major speech corpora. As a result,
    speakers of this dialect are often misunderstood by NLP applications. This study
    explores the effect on transcription accuracy of an automatic voice recognition
    system when AAVE data is used. Models trained on AAVE data and on Standard American
    English data were compared to a baseline model trained on a combination of the
    two dialects. The accuracy for both dialect-specific models was significantly
    higher than the baseline model, with the AAVE model showing over 18% improvement.
    By isolating the effect of having AAVE speakers in the training data, this study
    highlights the importance of increasing diversity in the field of natural language
    processing.

  abstract: Parts of speech (POS) tagging is the process of assigning the part of
    speech tag to each and every word in a sentence. In this paper, we have presented
    POS tagger for Kannada, a low resource south Asian language, using Condition Random
    Fields. POS tagger developed in the work uses novel features native to Kannada
    language. The novel features include Sandhi splitting, where a compound word is
    broken down into two or more meaningful constituent words. The proposed model
    is trained and tested on the tagged dataset which contains 21 thousand sentences
    and achieves a highest accuracy of 94.56%.

  abstract: Verbalization of non-lexical linguistic units plays an important role
    in language modeling for automatic speech recognition systems. Most verbalization
    methods require valuable resources such as ground truth, large training corpus
    and expert knowledge which are often unavailable. On the other hand a considerable
    amount of audio data along with its transcribed text are freely available on the
    Internet and could be utilized for the task of verbalization. This paper presents
    a methodology for accurate verbalization of audio transcriptions based on phone-level
    alignment between the transcriptions and their corresponding audio recordings.
    Comparing this approach to a more general rule-based verbalization method shows
    a significant improvement in ASR recognition of non-lexical units. In the process
    of evaluating this approach we also expose the indirect influence of verbalization
    accuracy on the quality of acoustic models trained on automatically derived speech
    corpora.

  abstract: This paper reports on experiments with different stacks of word embeddings
    and evaluation of their usefulness for Bulgarian downstream tasks such as Named
    Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) and Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging.
    Word embeddings stay in the core of the development of NLP, with several key language
    models being created over the last two years like FastText (CITATION), ElMo (CITATION),
    BERT (CITATION) and Flair (CITATION). Stacking or combining different word embeddings
    is another technique used in this paper and still not reported for Bulgarian NERC.
    Well-established architecture is used for the sequence tagging task such as BI-LSTM-CRF,
    and different pre-trained language models are combined in the embedding layer
    to decide which combination of them scores better.

  abstract: The paper describes three corpora of different varieties of BS that are
    currently being developed with the goal of providing data for the analysis of
    the diatopic and diachronic variation in non-standard Balkan Slavic. The corpora
    includes spoken materials from Torlak, Macedonian dialects, as well as the manuscripts
    of pre-standardized Bulgarian. Apart from the texts, tools for PoS annotation
    and lemmatization for all varieties are being created, as well as syntactic parsing
    for Torlak and Bulgarian varieties. The corpora are built using a unified methodology,
    relying on the pest practices and state-of-the-art methods from the field. The
    uniform methodology allows the contrastive analysis of the data from different
    varieties. The corpora under construction can be considered a crucial contribution
    to the linguistic research on the languages in the Balkans as they provide the
    lacking data needed for the studies of linguistic variation in the Balkan Slavic,
    and enable the comparison of the said varieties with other neighbouring languages.

    answers for factual questions about a given piece of text. However, some type
    of questions requires commonsense knowledge which cannot be inferred from the
    given text passage. Thus, external semantic information could enhance the performance
    of these models. This PhD research proposal provides a brief overview of some
    existing machine reading comprehension datasets and models and outlines possible
    ways of their improvement.
