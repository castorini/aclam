  abstract: 'We present the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets, which includes
    an array of subtasks on inferring the affectual state of a person from their tweet.
    For each task, we created labeled data from English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets.
    The individual tasks are: 1. emotion intensity regression, 2. emotion intensity
    ordinal classification, 3. valence (sentiment) regression, 4. valence ordinal
    classification, and 5. emotion classification. Seventy-five teams (about 200 team
    members) participated in the shared task. We summarize the methods, resources,
    and tools used by the participating teams, with a focus on the techniques and
    resources that are particularly useful. We also analyze systems for consistent
    bias towards a particular race or gender. The data is made freely available to
    further improve our understanding of how people convey emotions through language.'

  abstract: The paper describes the best performing system for the SemEval-2018 Affect
    in Tweets(English) sub-tasks. The system focuses on the ordinal classification
    and regression sub-tasks for valence and emotion. For ordinal classification valence
    is classified into 7 different classes ranging from -3 to 3 whereas emotion is
    classified into 4 different classes 0 to 3 separately for each emotion namely
    anger, fear, joy and sadness. The regression sub-tasks estimate the intensity
    of valence and each emotion. The system performs domain adaptation of 4 different
    models and creates an ensemble to give the final prediction. The proposed system
    achieved 1stposition out of 75 teams which participated in the fore-mentioned
    sub-tasks. We outperform the baseline model by margins ranging from 49.2% to 76.4
    %, thus, pushing the state-of-the-art significantly.

  abstract: This paper describes the results of the first Shared Task on Multilingual
    Emoji Prediction, organized as part of SemEval 2018. Given the text of a tweet,
    the task consists of predicting the most likely emoji to be used along such tweet.
    Two subtasks were proposed, one for English and one for Spanish, and participants
    were allowed to submit a system run to one or both subtasks. In total, 49 teams
    participated to the English subtask and 22 teams submitted a system run to the
    Spanish subtask. Evaluation was carried out emoji-wise, and the final ranking
    was based on macro F-Score. Data and further information about this task can be
    found at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344.

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in the SemEval-2018 task Multilingual
    Emoji Prediction. We participated in both English and Spanish subtasks, experimenting
    with support vector machines (SVMs) and recurrent neural networks. Our SVM classifier
    obtained the top rank in both subtasks with macro-averaged F1-measures of 35.99%
    for English and 22.36% for Spanish data sets. Similar to a few earlier attempts,
    the results with neural networks were not on par with linear SVMs.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the first shared task on irony detection: given a
    tweet, automatic natural language processing systems should determine whether
    the tweet is ironic (Task A) and which type of irony (if any) is expressed (Task
    B). The ironic tweets were collected using irony-related hashtags (i.e. #irony,
    #sarcasm, #not) and were subsequently manually annotated to minimise the amount
    of noise in the corpus. Prior to distributing the data, hashtags that were used
    to collect the tweets were removed from the corpus. For both tasks, a training
    corpus of 3,834 tweets was provided, as well as a test set containing 784 tweets.
    Our shared tasks received submissions from 43 teams for the binary classification
    Task A and from 31 teams for the multiclass Task B. The highest classification
    scores obtained for both subtasks are respectively F1= 0.71 and F1= 0.51 and demonstrate
    that fine-grained irony classification is much more challenging than binary irony
    detection.'

  abstract: Detecting irony is an important task to mine fine-grained information
    from social web messages. Therefore, the Semeval-2018 task 3 is aimed to detect
    the ironic tweets (subtask A) and their ironic types (subtask B). In order to
    address this task, we propose a system based on a densely connected LSTM network
    with multi-task learning strategy. In our dense LSTM model, each layer will take
    all outputs from previous layers as input. The last LSTM layer will output the
    hidden representations of texts, and they will be used in three classification
    task. In addition, we incorporate several types of features to improve the model
    performance. Our model achieved an F-score of 70.54 (ranked 2/43) in the subtask
    A and 49.47 (ranked 3/29) in the subtask B. The experimental results validate
    the effectiveness of our system.

  abstract: Character identification is a task of entity linking that finds the global
    entity of each personal mention in multiparty dialogue. For this task, the first
    two seasons of the popular TV show Friends are annotated, comprising a total of
    448 dialogues, 15,709 mentions, and 401 entities. The personal mentions are detected
    from nominals referring to certain characters in the show, and the entities are
    collected from the list of all characters in those two seasons of the show. This
    task is challenging because it requires the identification of characters that
    are mentioned but may not be active during the conversation. Among 90+ participants,
    four of them submitted their system outputs and showed strengths in different
    aspects about the task. Thorough analyses of the distributed datasets, system
    outputs, and comparative studies are also provided. To facilitate the momentum,
    we create an open-source project for this task and publicly release a larger and
    cleaner dataset, hoping to support researchers for more enhanced modeling.

  abstract: This paper presents the outcomes of the Parsing Time Normalization shared
    task held within SemEval-2018. The aim of the task is to parse time expressions
    into the compositional semantic graphs of the Semantically Compositional Annotation
    of Time Expressions (SCATE) schema, which allows the representation of a wider
    variety of time expressions than previous approaches. Two tracks were included,
    one to evaluate the parsing of individual components of the produced graphs, in
    a classic information extraction way, and another one to evaluate the quality
    of the time intervals resulting from the interpretation of those graphs. Though
    40 participants registered for the task, only one team submitted output, achieving
    0.55 F1 in Track 1 (parsing) and 0.70 F1 in Track 2 (intervals).

  abstract: This paper describes the NeuroSent system that participated in SemEval
    2018 Task 1. Our system takes a supervised approach that builds on neural networks
    and word embeddings. Word embeddings were built by starting from a repository
    of user generated reviews. Thus, they are specific for sentiment analysis tasks.
    Then, tweets are converted in the corresponding vector representation and given
    as input to the neural network with the aim of learning the different semantics
    contained in each emotion taken into account by the SemEval task. The output layer
    has been adapted based on the characteristics of each subtask. Preliminary results
    obtained on the provided training set are encouraging for pursuing the investigation
    into this direction.

  abstract: 'This paper presents an emotion classification system for English tweets,
    submitted for the SemEval shared task on Affect in Tweets, subtask 5: Detecting
    Emotions. The system combines lexicon, n-gram, style, syntactic and semantic features.
    For this multi-class multi-label problem, we created a classifier chain. This
    is an ensemble of eleven binary classifiers, one for each possible emotion category,
    where each model gets the predictions of the preceding models as additional features.
    The predicted labels are combined to get a multi-label representation of the predictions.
    Our system was ranked eleventh among thirty five participating teams, with a Jaccard
    accuracy of 52.0% and macro- and micro-average F1-scores of 49.3% and 64.0%, respectively.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we present our system for detecting valence task. The major
    issue was to apply a state-of-the-art system despite the small dataset provided:
    the system would quickly overfit. The main idea of our proposal is to use transfer
    learning, which allows to avoid learning from scratch. Indeed, we start to train
    a first model to predict if a tweet is positive, negative or neutral. For this
    we use an external dataset which is larger and similar to the target dataset.
    Then, the pre-trained model is re-used as the starting point to train a new model
    that classifies a tweet into one of the seven various levels of sentiment intensity.
    Our system, trained using transfer learning, achieves 0.776 and 0.763 respectively
    for Pearson correlation coefficient and weighted quadratic kappa metrics on the
    subtask evaluation dataset.'

  abstract: 'Written communication lacks the multimodal features such as posture,
    gesture and gaze that make it easy to model affective states. Especially in social
    media such as Twitter, due to the space constraints, the sources of information
    that can be mined are even more limited due to character limitations. These limitations
    constitute a challenge for understanding short social media posts. In this paper,
    we present an approach that utilizes multiple binary classifiers that represent
    different affective categories to model Twitter posts (e.g., tweets). We train
    domain-independent recurrent neural network models without any outside information
    such as affect lexicons. We then use these domain independent binary ranking models
    to evaluate the applicability of such deep learning models on the affect identification
    task. This approach allows different model architectures and parameter settings
    for each affect category instead of building one single multi-label classifier.
    The contributions of this paper are two-folds: we show that modeling tweets with
    a small training set is possible with the use of RNNs and we also prove that formulating
    affect identification as a binary classification task is highly effective.'

  abstract: "Traditional sentiment analysis approaches mainly focus on classifying\
    \ the sentiment polarities or emotion categories of texts. However, they can\u2019\
    t exploit the sentiment intensity information. Therefore, the SemEval-2018 Task\
    \ 1 is aimed to automatically determine the intensity of emotions or sentiment\
    \ of tweets to mine fine-grained sentiment information. In order to address this\
    \ task, we propose a system based on an attention CNN-LSTM model. In our model,\
    \ LSTM is used to extract the long-term contextual information from texts. We\
    \ apply attention techniques to selecting this information. A CNN layer with different\
    \ size of kernels is used to extract local features. The dense layers take the\
    \ pooled CNN feature maps and predict the intensity scores. Our system reaches\
    \ average Pearson correlation score of 0.722 (ranked 12/48) in emotion intensity\
    \ regression task, and 0.810 in valence regression task (ranked 15/38). It indicates\
    \ that our system can be further extended."

  abstract: While significant progress has been achieved for Opinion Mining in Arabic
    (OMA), very limited efforts have been put towards the task of Emotion mining in
    Arabic. In fact, businesses are interested in learning a fine-grained representation
    of how users are feeling towards their products or services. In this work, we
    describe the methods used by the team Emotion Mining in Arabic (EMA), as part
    of the SemEval-2018 Task 1 for Affect Mining for Arabic tweets. EMA participated
    in all 5 subtasks. For the five tasks, several preprocessing steps were evaluated
    and eventually the best system included diacritics removal, elongation adjustment,
    replacement of emojis by the corresponding Arabic word, character normalization
    and light stemming. Moreover, several features were evaluated along with different
    classification and regression techniques. For the 5 subtasks, word embeddings
    feature turned out to perform best along with Ensemble technique. EMA achieved
    the 1st place in subtask 5, and 3rd place in subtasks 1 and 3.

  abstract: While sentiment and emotion analysis has received a considerable amount
    of research attention, the notion of understanding and detecting the intensity
    of emotions is relatively less explored. This paper describes a system developed
    for predicting emotion intensity in tweets. Given a Twitter message, CrystalFeel
    uses features derived from parts-of-speech, n-grams, word embedding, and multiple
    affective lexicons including Opinion Lexicon, SentiStrength, AFFIN, NRC Emotion
    & Hash Emotion, and our in-house developed EI Lexicons to predict the degree of
    the intensity associated with fear, anger, sadness, and joy in the tweet. We found
    that including the affective lexicons-based features allowed the system to obtain
    strong prediction performance, while revealing interesting emotion word-level
    and message-level associations. On gold test data, CrystalFeel obtained Pearson
    correlations of 0.717 on average emotion intensity and of 0.816 on sentiment intensity.

  abstract: We implemented the sentiment system in all five subtasks for English and
    Spanish. All subtasks involve emotion or sentiment intensity prediction (regression
    and ordinal classification) and emotions determining (multi-labels classification).
    The useful BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory) model with attention
    mechanism was mainly applied for our system. We use BiLSTM in order to get word
    information extracted from both directions. The attention mechanism was used to
    find the contribution of each word for improving the scores. Furthermore, based
    on BiLSTMATT (BiLSTM with attention mechanism) a few deep-learning algorithms
    were employed for different subtasks. For regression and ordinal classification
    tasks we used domain adaptation and ensemble learning methods to leverage base
    model. While a single base model was used for multi-labels task.

  abstract: 'The present study describes our submission to SemEval 2018 Task 1: Affect
    in Tweets. Our Spanish-only approach aimed to demonstrate that it is beneficial
    to automatically generate additional training data by (i) translating training
    data from other languages and (ii) applying a semi-supervised learning method.
    We find strong support for both approaches, with those models outperforming our
    regular models in all subtasks. However, creating a stepwise ensemble of different
    models as opposed to simply averaging did not result in an increase in performance.
    We placed second (EI-Reg), second (EI-Oc), fourth (V-Reg) and fifth (V-Oc) in
    the four Spanish subtasks we participated in.'

    and sentiment, LSTM network module to solve multi-label classification, and the
    hierarchical attention network module for solving emotion and sentiment classification
    problem. According to the metrics of SemEval 2018, our system gets the final scores
    of 0.636, 0.531, 0.731, 0.708, and 0.408 on 5 subtasks, respectively.'

    of a tweet. We develop a multi-aspect feature learning mechanism to capture the
    most discriminative semantic features of a tweet as well as the emotion information
    conveyed by each word in it. We combine six types of feature groups: (1) a tweet
    representation learned by an LSTM deep neural network on the training data, (2)
    a tweet representation learned by an LSTM network on a large corpus of tweets
    that contain emotion words (a distant supervision corpus), (3) word embeddings
    trained on the distant supervision corpus and averaged over all words in a tweet,
    (4) word and character n-grams, (5) features derived from various sentiment and
    emotion lexicons, and (6) other hand-crafted features. As part of the word embedding
    training, we also learn the distributed representations of multi-word expressions
    (MWEs) and negated forms of words. An SVR regressor is then trained over the full
    set of features. We evaluate the effectiveness of our ensemble feature sets on
    the SemEval-2018 Task 1 datasets and achieve a Pearson correlation of 72% on the
    task of tweet emotion intensity prediction.'

  abstract: This paper presents a method for Affect in Tweets, which is the task to
    automatically determine the intensity of emotions and intensity of sentiment of
    tweets. The term affect refers to emotion-related categories such as anger, fear,
    etc. Intensity of emo-tions need to be quantified into a real valued score in
    [0, 1]. We propose an en-semble system including four different deep learning
    methods which are CNN, Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), LSTM-CNN and a CNN-based Attention
    model (CA). Our system gets an average Pearson correlation score of 0.682 in the
    subtask EI-reg and an average Pearson correlation score of 0.784 in subtask V-reg,
    which ranks 17th among 48 systems in EI-reg and 19th among 38 systems in V-reg.

  abstract: Emotions are a way of expressing human sentiments. In the modern era,
    social media is a platform where we convey our emotions. These emotions can be
    joy, anger, sadness and fear. Understanding the emotions from the written sentences
    is an interesting part in knowing about the writer. In the amount of digital language
    shared through social media, a considerable amount of data reflects the sentiment
    or emotion towards some product, person and organization. Since these texts are
    from users with diverse social aspects, these texts can be used to enrich the
    application related to the business intelligence. More than the sentiment, identification
    of intensity of the sentiment will enrich the performance of the end application.
    In this paper we experimented the intensity prediction as a text classification
    problem that evaluates the distributed representation text using aggregated sum
    and dimensionality reduction of the glove vectors of the words present in the
    respective texts .

  abstract: This paper discusses the experiments performed for predicting the emotion
    intensity in tweets using a generalized supervised learning approach. We extract
    3 kind of features from each of the tweets - one denoting the sentiment and emotion
    metrics obtained from different sentiment lexicons, one denoting the semantic
    representation of the word using dense representations like Glove, Word2vec and
    finally the syntactic information through POS N-grams, Word clusters, etc. We
    provide a comparative analysis of the significance of each of these features individually
    and in combination tested over standard regressors avaliable in scikit-learn.
    We apply an ensemble of these models to choose the best combination over cross
    validation.

  abstract: "Task 1 in the International Workshop SemEval 2018, Affect in Tweets,\
    \ introduces five subtasks (El-reg, El-oc, V-reg, V-oc, and E-c) to detect the\
    \ intensity of emotions in English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets. This paper describes\
    \ TeamUNCC\u2019s system to detect emotions in English and Arabic tweets. Our\
    \ approach is novel in that we present the same architecture for all the five\
    \ subtasks in both English and Arabic. The main input to the system is a combination\
    \ of word2vec and doc2vec embeddings and a set of psycholinguistic features (e.g.\
    \ from AffectTweets Weka-package). We apply a fully connected neural network architecture\
    \ and obtain performance results that show substantial improvements in Spearman\
    \ correlation scores over the baseline models provided by Task 1 organizers, (ranging\
    \ from 0.03 to 0.23). TeamUNCC\u2019s system ranks third in subtask El-oc and\
    \ fourth in other subtasks for Arabic tweets."

  abstract: We present our methods and results for affect analysis in Twitter developed
    as a part of SemEval-2018 Task 1, where the sub-tasks involve predicting the intensity
    of emotion, the intensity of sentiment, and valence for tweets. For modeling,
    though we use a traditional LSTM network, we combine our model with several state-of-the-art
    techniques to improve its performance in a low-resource setting. For example,
    we use an encoder-decoder network to initialize the LSTM weights. Without any
    task specific optimization we achieve competitive results (macro-average Pearson
    correlation coefficient 0.696) in the El-reg task. In this paper, we describe
    our development strategy in detail along with an exposition of our results.

  abstract: We take a multi-task learning approach to the shared Task 1 at SemEval-2018.
    The general idea concerning the model structure is to use as little external data
    as possible in order to preserve the task relatedness and reduce complexity. We
    employ multi-task learning with hard parameter sharing to exploit the relatedness
    between sub-tasks. As a base model, we use a standard recurrent neural network
    for both the classification and regression subtasks. Our system ranks 32nd out
    of 48 participants with a Pearson score of 0.557 in the first subtask, and 20th
    out of 35 in the fifth subtask with an accuracy score of 0.464.

  abstract: Emojis are widely used by social media and social network users when posting
    their messages. It is important to study the relationships between messages and
    emojis. Thus, in SemEval-2018 Task 2 an interesting and challenging task is proposed,
    i.e., predicting which emojis are evoked by text-based tweets. We propose a residual
    CNN-LSTM with attention (RCLA) model for this task. Our model combines CNN and
    LSTM layers to capture both local and long-range contextual information for tweet
    representation. In addition, attention mechanism is used to select important components.
    Besides, residual connection is applied to CNN layers to facilitate the training
    of neural networks. We also incorporated additional features such as POS tags
    and sentiment features extracted from lexicons. Our model achieved 30.25% macro-averaged

    approach is based on the classic bag-of-words model in conjunction with word embeddings.
    The used classification algorithm was Logistic Regression. This architecture was
    used and evaluated in the context of the SemEval 2018 challenge (task 2, subtask

    \ f1-scores on the official evaluation data were 21 and 18. The significant decrease\

  abstract: We present a system for emoji prediction on English and Spanish tweets,
    prepared for the SemEval-2018 task on Multilingual Emoji Prediction. We compared
    the performance of an SVM, LSTM and an ensemble of these two. We found the SVM
    performed best on our development set with an accuracy of 61.3% for English and
    83% for Spanish. The features used for the SVM are lowercased word n-grams in
    the range of 1 to 20, tokenised by a TweetTokenizer and stripped of stop words.
    On the test set, our model achieved an accuracy of 34% on English, with a slightly
    lower score of 29.7% accuracy on Spanish.

    We normalized text-based tweets during pre-processing, following which we utilized
    a bi-directional gated recurrent unit with an attention mechanism to build our
    base model. Multi-models with or without class weights were trained for the ensemble
    methods. We boosted models without class weights, and only strong boost classifiers
    were identified. In our system, not only was a boosting method used, but we also
    took advantage of the voting ensemble method to enhance our final system result.
    Our method demonstrated an obvious improvement of approximately 3% of the macro
    F1 score in English and 2% in Spanish.

  abstract: This paper describes the approach that was developed for SemEval 2018
    Task 2 (Multilingual Emoji Prediction) by the DUTH Team. First, we employed a
    combination of pre-processing techniques to reduce the noise of tweets and produce
    a number of features. Then, we built several N-grams, to represent the combination
    of word and emojis. Finally, we trained our system with a tuned LinearSVC classifier.
    Our approach in the leaderboard ranked 18th amongst 48 teams.

    is important forboth practical purposes (e.g. opinion mining,sentiment detection)
    and theoretical purposes(e.g. how different L1 speakers use them, dothey have
    some syntax?); this paper presents aset of experiments that aim to predict a singleemoji
    from a tweet. We built different mod-els and we found that the test results are
    verydifferent from the validation results.

  abstract: "Emoji is one of the \u201Cfastest growing language \u201D in pop-culture,\
    \ especially in social media and it is very unlikely for its usage to decrease.\
    \ These are generally used to bring an extra level of meaning to the texts, posted\
    \ on social media platforms. Providing such an added info, gives more insights\
    \ to the plain text, arising to hidden interpretation within the text. This paper\
    \ explains our analysis on Task 2, \u201D Multilingual Emoji Prediction\u201D\
    \ sharedtask conducted by Semeval-2018. In the task, a predicted emoji based on\
    \ a piece of Twitter text are labelled under 20 different classes (most commonly\
    \ used emojis) where these classes are learnt and further predicted are made for\
    \ unseen Twitter text. In this work, we have experimented and analysed emojis\
    \ predicted based on Twitter text, as a classification problem where the entailing\
    \ emoji is considered as a label for every individual text data. We have implemented\
    \ this using distributed representation of text through fastText. Also, we have\
    \ made an effort to demonstrate how fastText framework can be useful in case of\
    \ emoji prediction. This task is divide into two subtask, they are based on dataset\

    We used a random forest, with an ensemble of bag-of-words, sentiment and psycholinguistic
    features. Although we performed well on the trial dataset (attaining a macro f-score
    of 63.185 for English and 81.381 for Spanish), our approach did not perform as
    well on the test data. We describe our features and classi cation protocol, as
    well as initial experiments, concluding with a discussion of the discrepancy between

  abstract: This paper describes the NeuroSent system that participated in SemEval
    2018 Task 3. Our system takes a supervised approach that builds on neural networks
    and word embeddings. Word embeddings were built by starting from a repository
    of user generated reviews. Thus, they are specific for sentiment analysis tasks.
    Then, tweets are converted in the corresponding vector representation and given
    as input to the neural network with the aim of learning the different semantics
    contained in each emotion taken into account by the SemEval task. The output layer
    has been adapted based on the characteristics of each subtask. Preliminary results
    obtained on the provided training set are encouraging for pursuing the investigation
    into this direction.

    Shared Task on Irony Detection. We have approached the task with our low dimensionality
    representation method (LDR), which exploits low dimensional features extracted
    from text on the basis of the occurrence probability of the words depending on
    each class. Our intuition is that words in ironic texts have different probability
    of occurrence than in non-ironic ones. Our approach obtained acceptable results
    in both subtasks A and B. We have performed an error analysis that shows the difference
    on correct and incorrect classified tweets.

  abstract: In this paper we introduce our system for the task of Irony detection
    in English tweets, a part of SemEval 2018. We propose representation learning
    approach that relies on a multi-layered bidirectional LSTM, without using external
    features that provide additional semantic information. Although our model is able
    to outperform the baseline in the validation set, our results show limited generalization
    power over the test set. Given the limited size of the dataset, we think the usage
    of more pre-training schemes would greatly improve the obtained results.

  abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel feature extraction process for SemEval task
    3: Irony detection in English tweets. The proposed system incorporates a concatenative
    featurization of tweet and hashtags, which helps distinguishing between the irony-related
    and the other components. The system embeds tweets into a vector sequence with
    widely used pretrained word vectors, partially using a character embedding for
    the words that are out of vocabulary. Identification was performed with BiLSTM
    and CNN classifiers, achieving F1 score of 0.5939 (23/42) and 0.3925 (10/28) each
    for the binary and the multi-class case, respectively. The reliability of the
    proposed scheme was verified by analyzing the Gold test data, which demonstrates
    how hashtags can be taken into account when identifying various types of irony.'

    in tweets in this paper. Our model is trained using word embeddings and emoji
    embeddings. We show that adding sentiment scores to our model improves the F1
    score of our baseline LSTM by approximately .012, and therefore show that high-level
    features can be used to improve word embeddings in certain Natural Language Processing
    applications. Our model ranks 24/43 for binary classification and 5/31 for multiclass
    classification. We make our model easily accessible to the research community.

  abstract: The objective of this paper is to provide a description for a system built
    as our participation in SemEval-2018 Task 3 on Irony detection in English tweets.
    This system classifies a tweet as either ironic or non-ironic through a supervised
    learning approach. Our approach is to implement three feature models, and to then
    improve the performance of the supervised learning classification of tweets by
    combining many data features and using a voting system on four different classifiers.
    We describe the process of pre-processing data, extracting features, and running
    different types of classifiers against our feature set. In the competition, our
    system achieved an F1-score of 0.4675, ranking 35th in subtask A, and an F1-score
    score of 0.3014 ranking 22th in subtask B.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the Irony detection system that participates in
    SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony detection in English tweets. The system participated
    in the subtasks A and B. This paper discusses the results of our system in the
    development, evaluation and post evaluation. Each class in the dataset is represented
    as directed unweighted graphs. Then, the comparison is carried out with each class
    graph which results in a vector. This vector is used as features by machine learning
    algorithm. The model is evaluated on a hold on strategy. The organizers randomly
    split 80% (3,833 instances) training set (provided to the participant in training
    their system) and testing set 20%(958 instances). The test set is reserved to
    evaluate the performance of participants systems. During the evaluation, our system
    ranked 23 in the Coda Lab result of the subtask A (binary class problem). The
    binary class system achieves accuracy 0.6135, precision 0.5091, recall 0.7170
    and F measure 0.5955. The subtask B (multi-class problem) system is ranked 22
    in Coda Lab results. The multiclass model achieves the accuracy 0.4158, precision
    0.4055, recall 0.3526 and f measure 0.3101.'

  abstract: This paper describes the system we submitted to SemEval-2018 Task 3. The
    aim of the system is to distinguish between irony and non-irony in English tweets.
    We create a targeted feature set and analyse how different features are useful
    in the task of irony detection, achieving an F1-score of 0.5914. The analysis
    of individual features provides insight that may be useful in future attempts
    at detecting irony in tweets.

    The proposed method is composed of two renowned methods in text classification
    together with a novel approach for capturing ironic content by exploiting a tailored
    lexicon for irony detection. We experimented with different ensemble settings.
    The obtained results show that our method has a good performance for detecting
    the presence of ironic content in Twitter.

    of Irony detection in English tweets competition. Previous works demonstrate that
    LSTMs models have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing;
    besides, combining multiple classification from various individual classifiers
    in general is more powerful than a single classification. In order to obtain more
    precision classification of irony detection, our system trained several individual
    neural network classifiers and combined their results according to the ensemble-learning
    algorithm.

    3 (Irony detection in English tweets) Subtask A by the team Binarizer. Irony detection
    is a key task for many natural language processing works. Our method treats ironical
    tweets to consist of smaller parts containing different emotions. We break down
    tweets into separate phrases using a dependency parser. We then embed those phrases
    using an LSTM-based neural network model which is pre-trained to predict emoticons
    for tweets. Finally, we train a fully-connected network to achieve classification.

  abstract: Sentiment analysis plays an important role in E-commerce. Identifying
    ironic and sarcastic content in text plays a vital role in inferring the actual
    intention of the user, and is necessary to increase the accuracy of sentiment
    analysis. This paper describes the work on identifying the irony level in twitter
    texts. The system developed by the SSN MLRG1 team in SemEval-2018 for task 3 (irony
    detection) uses rule based approach for feature selection and MultiLayer Perceptron
    (MLP) technique to build the model for multiclass irony classification subtask,
    which classifies the given text into one of the four class labels.

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2018 Task 3 on Irony
    Detection in Tweets. We combine linguistic features with pre-trained activations
    of a neural network. The CNN is trained on the emoji prediction task. We combine
    the two feature sets and feed them into an XGBoost Classifier for classification.
    Subtask-A involves classification of tweets into ironic and non-ironic instances
    whereas Subtask-B involves classification of the tweet into - non-ironic, verbal
    irony, situational irony or other verbal irony. It is observed that combining
    features from these two different feature spaces improves our system results.
    We leverage the SMOTE algorithm to handle the problem of class imbalance in Subtask-B.
    Our final model achieves an F1-score of 0.65 and 0.47 on Subtask-A and Subtask-B
    respectively. Our system ranks 4th on both tasks respectively, outperforming the
    baseline by 6% on Subtask-A and 14% on Subtask-B.

  abstract: In this paper we describe the system used by the ValenTO team in the shared
    task on Irony Detection in English Tweets at SemEval 2018. The system takes as
    starting point emotIDM, an irony detection model that explores the use of affective
    features based on a wide range of lexical resources available for English, reflecting
    different facets of affect. We experimented with different settings, by exploiting
    different classifiers and features, and participated both to the binary irony
    detection task and to the task devoted to distinguish among different types of
    irony. We report on the results obtained by our system both in a constrained setting
    and unconstrained setting, where we explored the impact of using additional data
    in the training phase, such as corpora annotated for the presence of irony or
    sarcasm from the state of the art. Overall, the performance of our system seems
    to validate the important role that affective information has for identifying
    ironic content in Twitter.

  abstract: 'This paper describes the participation of the #NonDicevoSulSerio team
    at SemEval2018-Task3, which focused on Irony Detection in English Tweets and was
    articulated in two tasks addressing the identification of irony at different levels
    of granularity. We participated in both tasks proposed: Task A is a classical
    binary classification task to determine whether a tweet is ironic or not, while
    Task B is a multiclass classification task devoted to distinguish different types
    of irony, where systems have to predict one out of four labels describing verbal
    irony by clash, other verbal irony, situational irony, and non-irony. We addressed
    both tasks by proposing a model built upon a well-engineered features set involving
    both syntactic and lexical features, and a wide range of affective-based features,
    covering different facets of sentiment and emotions. The use of new features for
    taking advantage of the affective information conveyed by emojis has been analyzed.
    On this line, we also tried to exploit the possible incongruity between sentiment
    expressed in the text and in the emojis included in a tweet. We used a Support
    Vector Machine classifier, and obtained promising results. We also carried on
    experiments in an unconstrained setting.'

  abstract: "Character identification is an entity-linking task that finds words referring\
    \ to the same person among the nouns mentioned in a conversation and turns them\
    \ into one entity. In this paper, we define a sequence-labeling problem to solve\
    \ character identification, and propose an attention-based recurrent neural network\
    \ (RNN) encoder\u2013decoder model. The in-put document for character identification\
    \ on multiparty dialogues consists of several conversations, which increase the\
    \ length of the input sequence. The RNN encoder\u2013decoder model suffers from\
    \ poor performance when the length of the input sequence is long. To solve this\
    \ problem, we propose applying position encoding and the self-matching network\
    \ to the RNN encoder\u2013decoder model. Our experimental results demonstrate\
    \ that of the four models proposed, Model 2 showed an F1 score of 86.00% and a\
    \ label accuracy of 85.10% at the scene-level."

  abstract: In this paper, we describe the participation of the NewsReader system
    in the SemEval-2018 Task 5 on Counting Events and Participants in the Long Tail.
    NewsReader is a generic unsupervised text processing system that detects events
    with participants, time and place to generate Event Centric Knowledge Graphs (ECKGs).
    We minimally adapted these ECKGs to establish a baseline performance for the task.
    We first use the ECKGs to establish which documents report on the same incident
    and what event mentions are coreferential. Next, we aggregate ECKGs across coreferential
    mentions and use the aggregated knowledge to answer the questions of the task.
    Our participation tests the quality of NewsReader to create ECKGs, as well as
    the potential of ECKGs to establish event identity and reason over the result
    to answer the task queries.

  abstract: This paper describes the first task on semantic relation extraction and
    classification in scientific paper abstracts at SemEval 2018. The challenge focuses
    on domain-specific semantic relations and includes three different subtasks. The
    subtasks were designed so as to compare and quantify the effect of different pre-processing
    steps on the relation classification results. We expect the task to be relevant
    for a broad range of researchers working on extracting specialized knowledge from
    domain corpora, for example but not limited to scientific or bio-medical information
    extraction. The task attracted a total of 32 participants, with 158 submissions
    across different scenarios.

    a pair of candidate words as input. Instead, our reformulated task is defined
    as follows: given an input term, retrieve (or discover) its suitable hypernyms
    from a target corpus. We proposed five different subtasks covering three languages
    (English, Spanish, and Italian), and two specific domains of knowledge in English
    (Medical and Music). Participants were allowed to compete in any or all of the
    subtasks. Overall, a total of 11 teams participated, with a total of 39 different
    systems submitted through all subtasks. Data, results and further information
    about the task can be found at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17119.'

  abstract: This report summarizes the results of the SemEval 2018 task on machine
    comprehension using commonsense knowledge. For this machine comprehension task,
    we created a new corpus, MCScript. It contains a high number of questions that
    require commonsense knowledge for finding the correct answer. 11 teams from 4
    different countries participated in this shared task, most of them used neural
    approaches. The best performing system achieves an accuracy of 83.95%, outperforming
    the baselines by a large margin, but still far from the human upper bound, which
    was found to be at 98%.

  abstract: A natural language argument is composed of a claim as well as reasons
    given as premises for the claim. The warrant explaining the reasoning is usually
    left implicit, as it is clear from the context and common sense. This makes a
    comprehension of arguments easy for humans but hard for machines. This paper summarizes
    the first shared task on argument reasoning comprehension. Given a premise and
    a claim along with some topic information, the goal was to automatically identify
    the correct warrant among two candidates that are plausible and lexically close,
    but in fact imply opposite claims. We describe the dataset with 1970 instances
    that we built for the task, and we outline the 21 computational approaches that
    participated, most of which used neural networks. The results reveal the complexity
    of the task, with many approaches hardly improving over the random accuracy of
    about 0.5. Still, the best observed accuracy (0.712) underlines the principle
    feasibility of identifying warrants. Our analysis indicates that an inclusion
    of external knowledge is key to reasoning comprehension.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our GIST team system that participated in SemEval-2018
    Argument Reasoning Comprehension task (Task 12). Here, we address two challenging
    factors: unstated common senses and two lexically close warrants that lead to
    contradicting claims. A key idea for our system is full use of transfer learning
    from the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task to this task. We used Enhanced
    Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) to learn the NLI dataset. We describe how to
    use ESIM for transfer learning to choose correct warrant through a proposed system.
    We show comparable results through ablation experiments. Our system ranked 1st
    among 22 systems, outperforming all the systems more than 10%.'

  abstract: This paper reports our participation for SemEval-2018 Task 7 on extraction

    this deep learning model can be applied to extract and classify relations between
    entities for scientific papers at the same time. We use the Part-of-Speech and
    the distances to the target entities as part of the embedding for each word and
    we blind all the entities by marker names. In addition, we use sampling techniques
    to overcome the imbalance issues of this dataset. Our architecture obtained an
    F1-score of 35.4% for the relation extraction task and 18.5% for the relation
    classification task with a basic configuration of the one step CNN.

  abstract: 'SemEval 2018 Task 7 tasked participants to build a system to classify
    two entities within a sentence into one of the 6 possible relation types. We tested
    3 classes of models: Linear classifiers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
    and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Ultimately, the CNN model class
    proved most performant, so we specialized to this model for our final submissions.
    We improved performance beyond a vanilla CNN by including a variant of negative
    sampling, using custom word embeddings learned over a corpus of ACL articles,
    training over corpora of both tasks 1.1 and 1.2, using reversed feature, using
    part of context words beyond the entity pairs and using ensemble methods to improve
    our final predictions. We also tested attention based pooling, up-sampling, and
    data augmentation, but none improved performance. Our model achieved rank 6 out
    of 28 (macro-averaged F1-score: 72.7) in subtask 1.1, and rank 4 out of 20 (macro
    F1: 80.6) in subtask 1.2.'

  abstract: This article presents the SIRIUS-LTG-UiO system for the SemEval 2018 Task
    7 on Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers. First
    we extract the shortest dependency path (sdp) between two entities, then we introduce
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes the shortest dependency path
    embeddings as input and performs relation classification with differing objectives
    for each subtask of the shared task. This approach achieved overall F1 scores
    of 76.7 and 83.2 for relation classification on clean and noisy data, respectively.
    Furthermore, for combined relation extraction and classification on clean data,
    it obtained F1 scores of 37.4 and 33.6 for each phase. Our system ranks 3rd in
    all three sub-tasks of the shared task.

    in Task 7 of SemEval-2018 for which we experimented with two relations extraction
    tools - jSRE and TEES - for the extraction and classification of six relation
    types. The results we obtained with TEES were significantly superior than those
    with jSRE (33.4% vs. 30.09% and 20.3% vs. 16%). Additionally, we utilized the

  abstract: In this paper we describe our system for SemEval-2018 Task 7 on classification
    of semantic relations in scientific literature for clean (subtask 1.1) and noisy
    data (subtask 1.2). We compare two models for classification, a C-LSTM which utilizes
    only word embeddings and an SVM that also takes handcrafted features into account.
    To adapt to the domain of science we train word embeddings on scientific papers
    collected from arXiv.org. The hand-crafted features consist of lexical features
    to model the semantic relations as well as the entities between which the relation
    holds. Classification of Relations using Embeddings (ClaiRE) achieved an F1 score
    of 74.89% for the first subtask and 78.39% for the second.

  abstract: Discovering semantic relations within textual documents is a timely topic
    worthy of investigation. Natural language processing strategies are generally
    used for linking chunks of text in order to extract information that can be exploited
    by semantic search engines for performing complex queries. The scientific domain
    is an interesting area where these techniques can be applied. In this paper, we
    describe a system based on neural networks applied to the SemEval 2018 Task 7.
    The system relies on the use of word embeddings for composing the vectorial representation
    of text chunks. Such representations are used for feeding a neural network aims
    to learn the structure of paths connecting chunks associated with a specific relation.
    Preliminary results demonstrated the suitability of the proposed approach encouraging
    the investigation of this research direction.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our system, SciREL (Scientific abstract RELation
    extraction system), developed for the SemEval 2018 Task 7: Semantic Relation Extraction
    and Classification in Scientific Papers. We present a feature-vector based system
    to extract explicit semantic relation and classify them. Our system is trained
    in the ACL corpus (BIrd et al., 2008) that contains annotated abstracts given
    by the task organizers. When an abstract with annotated entities is given as the
    input into our system, it extracts the semantic relations through a set of defined
    features and classifies them into one of the given six categories of relations
    through feature engineering and a learned model. For the best combination of features,
    our system SciREL obtained an F-measure of 20.03 on the official test corpus which
    includes 150 abstracts in the relation classification Subtask 1.1. In this paper,
    we provide an in-depth error analysis of our results to prevent duplication of
    research efforts in the development of future systems'

  abstract: 'In this work we present our participation to SemEval-2018 Task 8 subtasks
    1 & 2 respectively. We developed Convolution Neural Network system for malware
    sentence classification (subtask 1) and Conditional Random Fields system for malware
    token label prediction (subtask 2). We experimented with couple of word embedding
    strategies, feature sets and achieved competitive performance across the two subtasks.
    For subtask 1 We experimented with two category of word embeddings namely native
    embeddings and task specific embedding using Word2vec and Glove algorithms. 1.
    Native Embeddings: All words including the unknown ones that are randomly initialized
    use embeddings from original Word2vec/Glove models. 2. Task specific : The embeddings
    are generated by training Word2vec/Glove algorithms on sentences from MalwareTextDB
    We found that glove outperforms rest of embeddings for subtask 1. For subtask
    2, we used N-grams of size 6, previous, next tokens and labels, features giving
    disjunctions of words anywhere in the left or right, word shape features, word
    lemma of current, previous and next words, word-tag pair features, POS tags, prefix

  abstract: In this paper, we describe our proposal for the task of Semantic Extraction
    from Cybersecurity Reports. The goal is to explore if natural language processing
    methods can provide relevant and actionable knowledge to contribute to better
    understand malicious behavior. Our method consists of an attention-based Bi-LSTM
    which achieved competitive performance of 0.57 for the Subtask 1. In the due process
    we also present ablation studies across multiple embeddings and their level of
    representation and also report the strategies we used to mitigate the extreme
    imbalance between classes.

  abstract: Cybersecurity risks such as malware threaten the personal safety of users,
    but to identify malware text is a major challenge. The paper proposes a supervised
    learning approach to identifying malware sentences given a document (subTask1
    of SemEval 2018, Task 8), as well as to classifying malware tokens in the sentences
    (subTask2). The approach achieved good results, ranking second of twelve participants
    for both subtasks, with F-scores of 57% for subTask1 and 28% for subTask2.

  abstract: The four sub-tasks of SecureNLP build towards a capability for quickly
    highlighting critical information from malware reports, such as the specific actions
    taken by a malware sample. Digital Operatives (DO) submitted to sub-tasks 1 and
    2, using standard text analysis technology (text classification for sub-task 1,
    and a CRF for sub-task 2). Performance is broadly competitive with other submitted
    systems on sub-task 1 and weak on sub-task 2. The annotation guidelines for the
    intermediate sub-tasks create a linkage to the final task, which is both an annotation
    challenge and a potentially useful feature of the task. The methods that DO chose
    do not attempt to make use of this linkage, which may be a missed opportunity.
    This motivates a post-hoc error analysis. It appears that the annotation task
    is very hard, and that in some cases both deep conceptual knowledge and substantial
    surrounding context are needed in order to correctly classify sentences.

  abstract: This paper describes a hypernym discovery system for our participation
    in the SemEval-2018 Task 9, which aims to discover the best (set of) candidate
    hypernyms for input concepts or entities, given the search space of a pre-defined
    vocabulary. We introduce a neural network architecture for the concerned task
    and empirically study various neural network models to build the representations
    in latent space for words and phrases. The evaluated models include convolutional
    neural network, long-short term memory network, gated recurrent unit and recurrent
    convolutional neural network. We also explore different embedding methods, including
    word embedding and sense embedding for better performance.

  abstract: Hypernym Discovery is the task of identifying potential hypernyms for
    a given term. A hypernym is a more generalized word that is super-ordinate to
    more specific words. This paper explores several approaches that rely on co-occurrence
    frequencies of word pairs, Hearst Patterns based on regular expressions, and word
    embeddings created from the UMBC corpus. Our system Babbage participated in Subtask
    1A for English and placed 6th of 19 systems when identifying concept hypernyms,
    and 12th of 18 systems for entity hypernyms.

  abstract: In this paper, we present our proposed system (EXPR) to participate in
    the hypernym discovery task of SemEval 2018. The task addresses the challenge
    of discovering hypernym relations from a text corpus. Our proposal is a combined
    approach of path-based technique and distributional technique. We use dependency
    parser on a corpus to extract candidate hypernyms and represent their dependency
    paths as a feature vector. The feature vector is concatenated with a feature vector
    obtained using Wikipedia pre-trained term embedding model. The concatenated feature
    vector fits a supervised machine learning method to learn a classifier model.
    This model is able to classify new candidate hypernyms as hypernym or not. Our
    system performs well to discover new hypernyms not defined in gold hypernyms.

    with state-of-the-art semantic spaces and with simple co-occurrence statistics.

  abstract: This paper presents the two systems submitted by the meaning space team
    in Task 10 of the SemEval competition 2018 entitled Capturing discriminative attributes.
    The systems consist of combinations of approaches exploiting explicitly encoded
    knowledge about concepts in WordNet and information encoded in distributional
    semantic vectors. Rather than aiming for high performance, we explore which kind
    of semantic knowledge is best captured by different methods. The results indicate
    that WordNet glosses on different levels of the hierarchy capture many attributes
    relevant for this task. In combination with exploiting word embedding similarities,
    this source of information yielded our best results. Our best performing system
    ranked 5th out of 13 final ranks. Our analysis yields insights into the different
    kinds of attributes represented by different sources of knowledge.

  abstract: This paper describes our system submission to the SemEval 2018 Task 10
    on Capturing Discriminative Attributes. Given two concepts and an attribute, the
    task is to determine whether the attribute is semantically related to one concept
    and not the other. In this work we assume that discriminative attributes can be
    detected by discovering the association (or lack of association) between a pair
    of words. The hypothesis we test in this contribution is whether the semantic
    difference between two pairs of concepts can be treated in terms of measuring
    the distance between words in a vector space, or can simply be obtained as a by-product
    of word co-occurrence counts.

  abstract: This article describes the unsupervised strategy submitted by the CitiusNLP
    team to the SemEval 2018 Task 10, a task which consists of predict whether a word
    is a discriminative attribute between two other words. Our strategy relies on
    the correspondence between discriminative attributes and relevant contexts of
    a word. More precisely, the method uses transparent distributional models to extract
    salient contexts of words which are identified as discriminative attributes. The
    system performance reaches about 70% accuracy when it is applied on the development
    dataset, but its accuracy goes down (63%) on the official test dataset.

  abstract: "Existing semantic models are capable of identifying the semantic similarity\
    \ of words. However, it\u2019s hard for these models to discriminate between a\
    \ word and another similar word. Thus, the aim of SemEval-2018 Task 10 is to predict\
    \ whether a word is a discriminative attribute between two concepts. In this task,\
    \ we apply a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-convolutional neural network (CNN) model\
    \ to identify whether an attribute is discriminative. The CNNs are used to extract\
    \ low-level features from the inputs. The MLP takes both the flatten CNN maps\
    \ and inputs to predict the labels. The evaluation F-score of our system on the\
    \ test set is 0.629 (ranked 15th), which indicates that our system still needs\
    \ to be improved. However, the behaviours of our system in our experiments provide\
    \ useful information, which can help to improve the collective understanding of\
    \ this novel task."

  abstract: "Semantic difference detection attempts to capture whether a word is a\
    \ discriminative attribute between two other words. For example, the discriminative\
    \ feature red characterizes the first word from the (apple, banana) pair, but\
    \ not the second. Modeling semantic difference is essential for language understanding\
    \ systems, as it provides useful information for identifying particular aspects\
    \ of word senses. This paper describes our system implementation (the ALB system\
    \ of the NLP@Unibuc team) for the 10th task of the SemEval 2018 workshop, \u201C\
    Capturing Discriminative Attributes\u201D. We propose a method for semantic difference\
    \ detection that uses an SVM classifier with features based on co-occurrence counts\
    \ and shallow semantic parsing, achieving 0.63 F1 score in the competition."

  abstract: "In this paper we report an unsupervised method aimed to identify whether\
    \ an attribute is discriminative for two words (which are treated as concepts,\
    \ in our particular case). To this end, we use geometrically inspired vector operations\
    \ underlying unsupervised decision functions. These decision functions operate\
    \ on state-of-the-art neural word embeddings of the attribute and the concepts.\
    \ The main idea can be described as follows: if attribute q discriminates concept\
    \ discriminates concept a from concept from concept b, then , then q is excluded\
    \ from the feature set shared by these two concepts: the intersection. That is,\
    \ the membership is excluded from the feature set shared by these two concepts:\
    \ the intersection. That is, the membership q\u2208 (a\u2229 b) does not hold.\
    \ As does not hold. As a,b,q are represented with neural word embeddings, we tested\
    \ vector operations allowing us to measure membership, i.e. fuzzy set operations\
    \ (t-norm, for fuzzy intersection, and t-conorm, for fuzzy union) and the similarity\
    \ between are represented with neural word embeddings, we tested vector operations\
    \ allowing us to measure membership, i.e. fuzzy set operations (t-norm, for fuzzy\
    \ intersection, and t-conorm, for fuzzy union) and the similarity between q and\
    \ the convex cone described by and the convex cone described by a and and b. ."

  abstract: This paper describes BomJi, a supervised system for capturing discriminative
    attributes in word pairs (e.g. yellow as discriminative for banana over watermelon).
    The system relies on an XGB classifier trained on carefully engineered graph-,
    pattern- and word embedding-based features. It participated in the SemEval-2018
    Task 10 on Capturing Discriminative Attributes, achieving an F1 score of 0.73
    and ranking 2nd out of 26 participant systems.

  abstract: This paper presents a comparison of several approaches for capturing discriminative
    attributes and considers an impact of concatenation of several word embeddings
    of different nature on the classification performance. A similarity-based method
    is proposed and compared with classical machine learning approaches. It is shown
    that this method outperforms others on all the considered word vector models and
    there is a performance increase when concatenated datasets are used.

    \ as features, mainly to improve upon the F1score, with the best accuracy. The\
    \ features are then further tuned on the validation scores, to achieve highest\
    \ F1score. Our evaluation narrowed down to two representations, classified on\
    \ CNN models, having a total dimension length of 1204 & 1203 for the final submissions.\

  abstract: We participated to the SemEval-2018 shared task on capturing discriminative
    attributes (Task 10) with a simple system that ranked 8th amongst the 26 teams
    that took part in the evaluation. Our final score was 0.67, which is competitive
    with the winning score of 0.75, particularly given that our system is a zero-shot
    system that requires no training and minimal parameter optimisation. In addition
    to describing the submitted system, and discussing the implications of the relative
    success of such a system on this task, we also report on other, more complex models
    we experimented with.

  abstract: In this paper we present three unsupervised models for capturing discriminative
    attributes based on information from word embeddings, WordNet, and sentence-level
    word co-occurrence frequency. We show that, of these approaches, the simple approach
    based on word co-occurrence performs best. We further consider supervised and
    unsupervised approaches to combining information from these models, but these
    approaches do not improve on the word co-occurrence model.

  abstract: This paper presents the NTU NLP Lab system for the SemEval-2018 Capturing
    Discriminative Attributes task. Word embeddings, pointwise mutual information
    (PMI), ConceptNet edges and shortest path lengths are utilized as input features
    to build binary classifiers to tell whether an attribute is discriminative for
    a pair of concepts. Our neural network model reaches about 73% F1 score on the
    test set and ranks the 3rd in the task. Though the attributes to deal with in
    this task are all visual, our models are not provided with any image data. The
    results indicate that visual information can be derived from textual data.

    participated in SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine Comprehension using commonsense
    knowledge. In this work, we train a series of neural network models such as multi-LSTM,
    BiLSTM, multi- BiLSTM-CNN and attention-based BiLSTM, etc. On top of some sub
    models, there are two kinds of word embedding: (a) general word embedding generated
    from unsupervised neural language model; and (b) position embedding generated
    from general word embedding. Finally, we make a hard vote on the predictions of
    these models and achieve relatively good result. The proposed approach achieves
    8th place in Task 11 with the accuracy of 0.7213.'

    system that solves multiple choice questions with a textual entailment perspective.
    Since some of the knowledge required is not explicitly mentioned in the text,
    we try to exploit commonsense knowledge by using pretrained word embeddings during
    contextual embeddings and by dynamically generating a weighted representation
    of related script knowledge. In the model two kinds of prediction structure are
    ensembled, and the final accuracy of our system is 10 percent higher than the
    naiive baseline.

  abstract: This shared task is a typical question answering task. Compared with the
    normal question and answer system, it needs to give the answer to the question
    based on the text provided. The essence of the problem is actually reading comprehension.
    Typically, there are several questions for each text that correspond to it. And
    for each question, there are two candidate answers (and only one of them is correct).
    To solve this problem, the usual approach is to use convolutional neural networks
    (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) or their improved models (such as long
    short-term memory (LSTM)). In this paper, an attention-based CNN-LSTM model is
    proposed for this task. By adding an attention mechanism and combining the two
    models, this experimental result has been significantly improved.

  abstract: This paper describes the IUCM entry at SemEval-2018 Task 11, on machine
    comprehension using commonsense knowledge. First, clustering and topic modeling
    are used to divide given texts into topics. Then, during the answering phase,
    other texts of the same topic are retrieved and used as commonsense knowledge.
    Finally, the answer is selected. While clustering itself shows good results, finding
    an answer proves to be more challenging. This paper reports the results of system
    evaluation and suggests potential improvements.

  abstract: Machine Comprehension of text is a typical Natural Language Processing
    task which remains an elusive challenge. This paper is to solve the task 11 of
    SemEval-2018, Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task. We use deep
    learning model to solve the problem. We build distributed word embedding of text,
    question and answering respectively instead of manually extracting features by
    linguistic tools. Meanwhile, we use a series of frameworks such as CNN model,
    LSTM model, LSTM with attention model and biLSTM with attention model for processing
    word vector. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of biLSTM with attention
    framework compared to other models. We also delete high frequency words and combine
    word vector and data augmentation methods, achieved a certain effect. The approach
    we proposed rank 6th in official results, with accuracy rate of 0.7437 in test
    dataset.

  abstract: We present a novel neural architecture for the Argument Reasoning Comprehension
    task of SemEval 2018. It is a simple neural network consisting of three parts,
    collectively judging whether the logic built on a set of given sentences (a claim,
    reason, and warrant) is plausible or not. The model utilizes contextualized word
    vectors pre-trained on large machine translation (MT) datasets as a form of transfer
    learning, which can help to mitigate the lack of training data. Quantitative analysis
    shows that simply leveraging LSTMs trained on MT datasets outperforms several
    baselines and non-transferred models, achieving accuracies of about 70% on the
    development set and about 60% on the test set.

  abstract: The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task is a difficult challenge requiring
    significant language understanding and complex reasoning over world knowledge.
    We focus on transfer of a sentence encoder to bootstrap more complicated architectures
    given the small size of the dataset. Our best model uses a pre-trained BiLSTM
    to encode input sentences, learns task-specific features for the argument and
    warrants, then performs independent argument-warrant matching. This model achieves
    mean test set accuracy of 61.31%. Encoder transfer yields a significant gain to
    our best model over random initialization. Sharing parameters for independent
    warrant evaluation provides regularization and effectively doubles the size of
    the dataset. We demonstrate that regularization comes from ignoring statistical
    correlations between warrant positions. We also report an experiment with our
    best model that only matches warrants to reasons, ignoring claims. Performance
    is still competitive, suggesting that our model is not necessarily learning the
    intended task.

  abstract: To comprehend an argument and fill the gap between claims and reasons,
    it is vital to find the implicit supporting warrants behind. In this paper, we
    propose a hierarchical attention model to identify the right warrant which explains
    why the reason stands for the claim. Our model focuses not only on the similar
    part between warrants and other information but also on the contradictory part
    between two opposing warrants. In addition, we use the ensemble method for different
    models. Our model achieves an accuracy of 61%, ranking second in this task. Experimental
    results demonstrate that our model is effective to make correct choices.

  abstract: An argument is divided into two parts, the claim and the reason. To obtain
    a clearer conclusion, some additional explanation is required. In this task, the
    explanations are called warrants. This paper introduces a bi-directional long
    short term memory (Bi-LSTM) with an attention model to select a correct warrant
    from two to explain an argument. We address this question as a question-answering
    system. For each warrant, the model produces a probability that it is correct.
    Finally, the system chooses the highest correct probability as the answer. Ensemble
    learning is used to enhance the performance of the model. Among all of the participants,
    we ranked 15th on the test results.

  abstract: This paper describes our participation in the SemEval-2018 Task 12 Argument
    Reasoning Comprehension Task which calls to develop systems that, given a reason
    and a claim, predict the correct warrant from two opposing options. We decided
    to use a deep learning architecture and combined 623 models with different hyperparameters
    into an ensemble. Our extensive analysis of our architecture and ensemble reveals
    that the decision to use an ensemble was suboptimal. Additionally, we benchmark
    a support vector machine as a baseline. Furthermore, we experimented with an alternative
    data split and achieved more stable results.

  abstract: This paper describes the system submitted to SemEval-2018 Task 12 (The
    Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task). Enabling a computer to understand a text
    so that it can answer comprehension questions is still a challenging goal of NLP.
    We propose a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model that reads two sentences separated
    by a delimiter to determine which warrant is correct. We extend this model with
    a neural attention mechanism that encourages the model to make reasoning over
    the given claims and reasons. Officially released results show that our system
    ranks 6th among 22 submissions to this task.

  abstract: Reasoning is a crucial part of natural language argumentation. In order
    to comprehend an argument, we have to reconstruct and analyze its reasoning. In
    this task, given a natural language argument with a reason and a claim, the goal
    is to choose the correct implicit reasoning from two options, in order to form
    a reasonable structure of (Reason, Warrant, Claim). Our approach is to build distributed
    word embedding of reason, warrant and claim respectively, meanwhile, we use a
    series of frameworks such as CNN model, LSTM model, GRU with attention model and
    biLSTM with attention model for processing word vector. Finally, ensemble mechanism
    is used to integrate the results of each framework to improve the final accuracy.
    Experiments demonstrate superior performance of ensemble mechanism compared to
    each separate framework. We are the 11th in official results, the final model
    can reach a 0.568 accuracy rate on the test dataset.

  abstract: 'This paper describes our system in SemEval-2018 task 12: Argument Reasoning
    Comprehension. The task is to select the correct warrant that explains reasoning
    of a particular argument consisting of a claim and a reason. The main idea of
    our methods is based on the assumption that the semantic composition of the reason
    and the warrant should be close to the semantic representation of the corresponding
    claim. We propose two neural network models. The first one considers two warrant
    candidates simultaneously, while the second one processes each candidate separately
    and then chooses the best one. We also incorporate sentiment polarity by assuming
    that there are kinds of sentiment associations between the reason, the warrant
    and the claim. The experiments show that the first framework is more effective
    and sentiment polarity is useful.'

  abstract: We present an approach to event coreference resolution by developing a
    general framework for clustering that uses supervised representation learning.
    We propose a neural network architecture with novel Clustering-Oriented Regularization
    (CORE) terms in the objective function. These terms encourage the model to create
    embeddings of event mentions that are amenable to clustering. We then use agglomerative
    clustering on these embeddings to build event coreference chains. For both within-
    and cross-document coreference on the ECB+ corpus, our model obtains better results
    than models that require significantly more pre-annotated information. This work
    provides insight and motivating results for a new general approach to solving
    coreference and clustering problems with representation learning.

  abstract: Human world knowledge contains information about prototypical events and
    their participants and locations. In this paper, we train the first models using
    multi-task learning that can both predict missing event participants and also
    perform semantic role classification based on semantic plausibility. Our best-performing
    model is an improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on thematic fit modelling
    tasks. The event embeddings learned by the model can additionally be used effectively
    in an event similarity task, also outperforming the state-of-the-art.

  abstract: This paper presents a collection to assess meaning components in German
    complex verbs, which frequently undergo meaning shifts. We use a novel strategy
    to obtain source and target domain characterisations via sentence generation rather
    than sentence annotation. A selection of arrows adds spatial directional information
    to the generated contexts. We provide a broad qualitative description of the dataset,
    and a series of standard classification experiments verifies the quantitative
    reliability of the presented resource. The setup for collecting the meaning components
    is applicable also to other languages, regarding complex verbs as well as other
    language-specific targets that involve meaning shifts.

  abstract: Measuring the salience of a word is an essential step in numerous NLP
    tasks. Heuristic approaches such as tfidf have been used so far to estimate the
    salience of words. We propose Neural Word Salience (NWS) scores, unlike heuristics,
    are learnt from a corpus. Specifically, we learn word salience scores such that,
    using pre-trained word embeddings as the input, can accurately predict the words
    that appear in a sentence, given the words that appear in the sentences preceding
    or succeeding that sentence. Experimental results on sentence similarity prediction
    show that the learnt word salience scores perform comparably or better than some
    of the state-of-the-art approaches for representing sentences on benchmark datasets
    for sentence similarity, while using only a fraction of the training and prediction
    times required by prior methods. Moreover, our NWS scores positively correlate
    with psycholinguistic measures such as concreteness, and imageability implying
    a close connection to the salience as perceived by humans.

  abstract: This paper describes CCG/AMR, a novel grammar for semantic parsing of
    Abstract Meaning Representations. CCG/AMR equips Combinatory Categorial Grammar
    derivations with graph semantics by assigning each CCG combinator an interpretation
    in terms of a graph algebra. We provide an algorithm that induces a CCG/AMR from
    a corpus and show that it creates a compact lexicon with low ambiguity and achieves
    a robust coverage of 78% of the examined sentences under ideal conditions. We
    also identify several phenomena that affect any approach relying either on CCG
    or graph algebraic approaches for AMR parsing. This includes differences of representation
    between CCG and AMR, as well as non-compositional constructions that are not expressible
    through a monotonous construction process. To our knowledge, this paper provides
    the first analysis of these corpus issues.

  abstract: The first stage of every knowledge base question answering approach is
    to link entities in the input question. We investigate entity linking in the context
    of question answering task and present a jointly optimized neural architecture
    for entity mention detection and entity disambiguation that models the surrounding
    context on different levels of granularity. We use the Wikidata knowledge base
    and available question answering datasets to create benchmarks for entity linking
    on question answering data. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
    system on this data, resulting in an average 8% improvement of the final score.
    We further demonstrate that our model delivers a strong performance across different
    entity categories.

  abstract: 'Across disciplines, researchers are eager to gain insight into empirical
    features of abstract vs. concrete concepts. In this work, we provide a detailed
    characterisation of the distributional nature of abstract and concrete words across
    16,620 English nouns, verbs and adjectives. Specifically, we investigate the following
    questions: (1) What is the distribution of concreteness in the contexts of concrete
    and abstract target words? (2) What are the differences between concrete and abstract
    words in terms of contextual semantic diversity? (3) How does the entropy of concrete
    and abstract word contexts differ? Overall, our studies show consistent differences
    in the distributional representation of concrete and abstract words, thus challenging
    existing theories of cognition and providing a more fine-grained description of
    their nature.'

  abstract: The aim of this work is to explore the possible limitations of existing
    methods of cross-language word embeddings evaluation, addressing the lack of correlation
    between intrinsic and extrinsic cross-language evaluation methods. To prove this
    hypothesis, we construct English-Russian datasets for extrinsic and intrinsic
    evaluation tasks and compare performances of 5 different cross-language models
    on them. The results say that the scores even on different intrinsic benchmarks
    do not correlate to each other. We can conclude that the use of human references
    as ground truth for cross-language word embeddings is not proper unless one does
    not understand how do native speakers process semantics in their cognition.

  abstract: In this paper we analyze the use of emojis in social media with respect
    to gender and skin tone. By gathering a dataset of over twenty two million tweets
    from United States some findings are clearly highlighted after performing a simple
    frequency-based analysis. Moreover, we carry out a semantic analysis on the usage
    of emojis and their modifiers (e.g. gender and skin tone) by embedding all words,
    emojis and modifiers into the same vector space. Our analyses reveal that some
    stereotypes related to the skin color and gender seem to be reflected on the use
    of these modifiers. For example, emojis representing hand gestures are more widely
    utilized with lighter skin tones, and the usage across skin tones differs significantly.
    At the same time, the vector corresponding to the male modifier tends to be semantically
    close to emojis related to business or technology, whereas their female counterparts
    appear closer to emojis about love or makeup.

  abstract: When we build a neural network model predicting the relationship between
    two sentences, the most general and intuitive approach is to use a Siamese architecture,
    where the sentence vectors obtained from a shared encoder is given as input to
    a classifier. For the classifier to work effectively, it is important to extract
    appropriate features from the two vectors and feed them as input. There exist
    several previous works that suggest heuristic-based function for matching sentence
    vectors, however it cannot be said that the heuristics tailored for a specific
    task generalize to other tasks. In this work, we propose a new matching function,
    ElBiS, that learns to model element-wise interaction between two vectors. From
    experiments, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed ElBiS matching function
    outperforms the concatenation-based or heuristic-based matching functions on natural
    language inference and paraphrase identification, while maintaining the fused
    representation compact.

  abstract: Mining electronic health records for patients who satisfy a set of predefined
    criteria is known in medical informatics as phenotyping. Phenotyping has numerous
    applications such as outcome prediction, clinical trial recruitment, and retrospective
    studies. Supervised machine learning for phenotyping typically relies on sparse
    patient representations such as bag-of-words. We consider an alternative that
    involves learning patient representations. We develop a neural network model for
    learning patient representations and show that the learned representations are
    general enough to obtain state-of-the-art performance on a standard comorbidity
    detection task.

  abstract: Cross-lingual information extraction (CLIE) is an important and challenging
    task, especially in low resource scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose
    a training method, called Halo, which enforces the local region of each hidden
    state of a neural model to only generate target tokens with the same semantic
    structure tag. This simple but powerful technique enables a neural model to learn
    semantics-aware representations that are robust to noise, without introducing
    any extra parameter, thus yielding better generalization in both high and low
    resource settings.

  abstract: Annotating temporal relations (TempRel) between events described in natural
    language is known to be labor intensive, partly because the total number of TempRels
    is quadratic in the number of events. As a result, only a small number of documents
    are typically annotated, limiting the coverage of various lexical/semantic phenomena.
    In order to improve existing approaches, one possibility is to make use of the
    readily available, partially annotated data (P as in partial) that cover more
    documents. However, missing annotations in P are known to hurt, rather than help,
    existing systems. This work is a case study in exploring various usages of P for
    TempRel extraction. Results show that despite missing annotations, P is still
    a useful supervision signal for this task within a constrained bootstrapping learning
    framework. The system described in this system is publicly available.

  abstract: 'Neural word embeddings models (such as those built with word2vec) are
    known to have stability problems: when retraining a model with the exact same
    hyperparameters, words neighborhoods may change. We propose a method to estimate
    such variation, based on the overlap of neighbors of a given word in two models
    trained with identical hyperparameters. We show that this inherent variation is
    not negligible, and that it does not affect every word in the same way. We examine
    the influence of several features that are intrinsic to a word, corpus or embedding
    model and provide a methodology that can predict the variability (and as such,
    reliability) of a word representation in a semantic vector space.'

  abstract: Supervised distributional methods are applied successfully in lexical
    entailment, but recent work questioned whether these methods actually learn a
    relation between two words. Specifically, Levy et al. (2015) claimed that linear
    classifiers learn only separate properties of each word. We suggest a cheap and
    easy way to boost the performance of these methods by integrating multiplicative
    features into commonly used representations. We provide an extensive evaluation
    with different classifiers and evaluation setups, and suggest a suitable evaluation
    setup for the task, eliminating biases existing in previous ones.

  abstract: We propose a practical model for named entity recognition (NER) that combines
    word and character-level information with a specific learned representation of
    the prefixes and suffixes of the word. We apply this approach to multilingual
    and multi-domain NER and show that it achieves state of the art results on the
    CoNLL 2002 Spanish and Dutch and CoNLL 2003 German NER datasets, consistently
    achieving 1.5-2.3 percent over the state of the art without relying on any dictionary
    features. Additionally, we show improvement on SemEval 2013 task 9.1 DrugNER,
    achieving state of the art results on the MedLine dataset and the second best
    results overall (-1.3% from state of the art). We also establish a new benchmark
    on the I2B2 2010 Clinical NER dataset with 84.70 F-score.

  abstract: We propose a hypothesis only baseline for diagnosing Natural Language
    Inference (NLI). Especially when an NLI dataset assumes inference is occurring
    based purely on the relationship between a context and a hypothesis, it follows
    that assessing entailment relations while ignoring the provided context is a degenerate
    solution. Yet, through experiments on 10 distinct NLI datasets, we find that this
    approach, which we refer to as a hypothesis-only model, is able to significantly
    outperform a majority-class baseline across a number of NLI datasets. Our analysis
    suggests that statistical irregularities may allow a model to perform NLI in some
    datasets beyond what should be achievable without access to the context.

    \ sentences express (sense-specific) corpus-independent meanings of words, hence\
    \ definition-driven approaches enable strong generalization \u2013 once trained,\
    \ the model is expected to work well in open-domain testbeds; (ii) Global context\

  abstract: 'Being able to predict whether people agree or disagree with an assertion
    (i.e. an explicit, self-contained statement) has several applications ranging
    from predicting how many people will like or dislike a social media post to classifying
    posts based on whether they are in accordance with a particular point of view.
    We formalize this as two NLP tasks: predicting judgments of (i) individuals and
    (ii) groups based on the text of the assertion and previous judgments. We evaluate
    a wide range of approaches on a crowdsourced data set containing over 100,000
    judgments on over 2,000 assertions. We find that predicting individual judgments
    is a hard task with our best results only slightly exceeding a majority baseline,
    but that judgments of groups can be more reliably predicted using a Siamese neural
    network, which outperforms all other approaches by a wide margin.'

  abstract: Current methods for knowledge graph (KG) representation learning focus
    solely on the structure of the KG and do not exploit any kind of external information,
    such as visual and linguistic information corresponding to the KG entities. In
    this paper, we propose a multimodal translation-based approach that defines the
    energy of a KG triple as the sum of sub-energy functions that leverage both multimodal
    (visual and linguistic) and structural KG representations. Next, a ranking-based
    loss is minimized using a simple neural network architecture. Moreover, we introduce
    a new large-scale dataset for multimodal KG representation learning. We compared
    the performance of our approach to other baselines on two standard tasks, namely
    knowledge graph completion and triple classification, using our as well as the
    WN9-IMG dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baselines
    on both tasks and datasets.

  abstract: While there have been many proposals for theories of semantic roles over
    the years, these models are mostly justified by intuition and the only evaluation
    methods have been inter-annotator agreement. We explore three different ideas
    for providing more rigorous theories of semantic roles. These ideas give rise
    to more objective criteria for designing role sets, and lend themselves to some
    experimental evaluation. We illustrate the discussion by examining the semantic
    roles in TRIPS.

    our metric and human judgments of semantic similarity. Furthermore, we propose
    an application of our measure for clustering frame instances to extract prototypical

  abstract: Feature sparseness is a problem common to cross-domain and short-text
    classification tasks. To overcome this feature sparseness problem, we propose
    a novel method based on graph decomposition to find candidate features for expanding
    feature vectors. Specifically, we first create a feature-relatedness graph, which
    is subsequently decomposed into core-periphery (CP) pairs and use the peripheries
    as the expansion candidates of the cores. We expand both training and test instances
    using the computed related features and use them to train a text classifier. We
    observe that prioritising features that are common to both training and test instances
    as cores during the CP decomposition to further improve the accuracy of text classification.
    We evaluate the proposed CP-decomposition-based feature expansion method on benchmark
    datasets for cross-domain sentiment classification and short-text classification.
    Our experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
    all baselines on short-text classification tasks, and perform competitively with
    pivot-based cross-domain sentiment classification methods.

  abstract: "Words are polysemous and multi-faceted, with many shades of meanings.\
    \ We suggest that sparse distributed representations are more suitable than other,\
    \ commonly used, (dense) representations to express these multiple facets, and\
    \ present Category Builder, a working system that, as we show, makes use of sparse\
    \ representations to support multi-faceted lexical representations. We argue that\
    \ the set expansion task is well suited to study these meaning distinctions since\
    \ a word may belong to multiple sets with a different reason for membership in\
    \ each. We therefore exhibit the performance of Category Builder on this task,\
    \ while showing that our representation captures at the same time analogy problems\
    \ such as \u201Cthe Ganga of Egypt\u201D or \u201Cthe Voldemort of Tolkien\u201D\
    . Category Builder is shown to be a more expressive lexical representation and\
    \ to outperform dense representations such as Word2Vec in some analogy classes\
    \ despite being shown only two of the three input terms."

  abstract: Tree-structured LSTMs have shown advantages in learning semantic representations
    by exploiting syntactic information. Most existing methods model tree structures
    by bottom-up combinations of constituent nodes using the same shared compositional
    function and often making use of input word information only. The inability to
    capture the richness of compositionality makes these models lack expressive power.
    In this paper, we propose multiplicative tree-structured LSTMs to tackle this
    problem. Our model makes use of not only word information but also relation information
    between words. It is more expressive, as different combination functions can be
    used for each child node. In addition to syntactic trees, we also investigate
    the use of Abstract Meaning Representation in tree-structured models, in order
    to incorporate both syntactic and semantic information from the sentence. Experimental
    results on common NLP tasks show the proposed models lead to better sentence representation
    and AMR brings benefits in complex tasks.
